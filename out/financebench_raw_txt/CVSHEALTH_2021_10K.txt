re beneficiaries; participates in Medicaid and subsidized Children’s Health Insurance Programs (“CHIP”); and participates indemonstration projects 
for members who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (“Duals”). These Government Medical products are further describedbelow:
•
Medicare Advantage: Through annual contracts with th e U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Company offers HMO andPPO products for eligible individua
ls in certain geographic areas through the Medicare Advantage program. Members typically receive enhancedbenefits over traditional fee-for-
service Medicare coverage (“Original Medicare”), including reduced cost-sharing for preventive care, vision andother services. The Company off
ered network-based HMO and/or PPO plans in 46 states and Washington, D.C. in 2021. For certain qualifyingemployer groups, the Company offe

The Company also has a portfolio of 
transformative products and services aimed at creating a holistic and integrated approach to individual health and wellness.These products and services co
mplement the Commercial Medical and Government Medical products and aim to provide innovative solutions, create integratedexperience offerings 
and enable enhanced care delivery to customers.Health Care Benefits Provider Networks
The Company contracts with physici
ans, hospitals and other providers for services they provide to the Company’s members. The Company uses a variety oftechniques designed t
o help encourage appropriate utilization of medical services (“utilization”) and maintain affordability of quality coverage. In addition tocontracts with provider
s for negotiated rates of reimbursement, these techniques include creating risk sharing arrangements that align economic incentives withproviders, the development 
and implementation of guidelines for the appropriate utilization and the provision of data to providers to enable them to improve healthcare quality. At Decembe
r 31, 2021, the Company’s underlying nationwide provider network had approximately 1.5 million participating providers. Otherproviders in the Company’s provide
r networks also include laboratory, imaging, urgent care and other freestanding health facilities.Health Care Benefits Quality Assessment
CMS uses a 5-star rating system to 
monitor Medicare health care and drug plans and ensure that they meet CMS’s quality standards. CMS uses this rating systemto provide Medicare beneficiarie
s with a tool that they can use to compare the overall quality of care and level of customer service of companies that provideMedicare health ca
re and drug plans. The rating system considers a variety of measures adopted by CMS, including quality of preventative services, chronic illnessmanagement and overal
l customer satisfaction. See “Health Care Benefits Pricing” below in this Item 1 for further discussion of star ratings. The Company seeksHealth Plan accredita
tion for Aetna HMO plans from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”), a private, not-for-profit organization thatevaluates, accredi
ts and certifies a wide range of health care organizations. Health care plans seeking accreditation must pass a rigorous, comprehensive review andmust annually report on the
ir performance.Aetna Life Insurance Company (
“ALIC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has received nationwide NCQA PPO Health Plan accreditation. As ofDecember 31, 2021, all of the Company
’s Commercial HMO and all of ALIC’s PPO members who were eligible participated in HMOs or PPOs that are accreditedby the NCQA.
The Company’s provider select
ion and credentialing/re-credentialing policies and procedures are consistent with NCQA and URAC, a health care accreditingorganization that est
ablishes quality standards for the health care industry, as well as state and federal, requirements. In addition, the Company is certified under theNCQA Credentials Verification Organi
zation (“CVO”) certification program for all certification options and has URAC CVO accreditation.Quality assessment programs 
for contracted providers who participate in the Company’s networks begin with the initial review of health care practitioners.Practitioners’ lic
enses and education are verified, and their work history is collected by the Company or in some cases by the practitioner’s affiliated group ororganization. The Company gener
ally requires participating hospitals to be certified by CMS or accredited by The Joint Commission, the American OsteopathicAssociation, or Det Norske Veritas Hea
lthcare.The Company also offers quality 
and outcome measurement programs, quality improvement programs, and health care data analysis systems to providers andpurchasers of health ca
re services.Health Care Benefits Information Systems
The Health Care Benefits segm
ent currently operates and supports an end-to-end suite of information technology platforms to support member engagement,enrollment, health benefit admi
nistration, care management, service operations, financial reporting and analytics. The multiple platforms are supported by anintegration layer to facilitate the tra
nsfer of real-time data. There is continued focus and investment in enterprise data platforms, cloud capabilities, digital productsto offer innovative solut
ions and a seamless experience to the Company’s members through mobile and web channels. The Company is making concertedinvestments in emerging tec
hnology capabilities such as voice, artificial intelligence and robotics to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience forall of its constituents. Th
e Health Care Benefits segment is utilizing the4

full breadth of the Company’s assets to build enterprise technology that will help guide our members through their health care journey, provide them a high level ofservice, enable healthier outc
omes and encourage them to take next best actions to lead healthier lives.Health Care Benefits Customers
Medical membership is d
ispersed throughout the United States, and the Company also serves medical members in certain countries outside the United States. TheCompany offers a broad range of 
traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, many of which are availablenationwide. Depending on the product, th
e Company markets to a range of customers including employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time andhourly workers, health plans, provid
ers, governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. For additional information on medicalmembership, see “Health Ca
re Benefits Segment” in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the “MD&A”)included in Item 7 of this 10
-K.The Company markets both Commerc
ial Insured and ASC products and services primarily to employers that sponsor the Company’s products for the benefit oftheir employees and the
ir employees’ dependents. Frequently, larger employers offer employees a choice among coverage options, from which the employeemakes his or her select
ion during a designated annual open enrollment period. Typically, employers pay all of the monthly premiums to the Company and, throughpayroll deductions, obtain r
eimbursement from employees for a percentage of the premiums that is determined by each employer. Some Health Care Benefitsproducts are sold direct
ly to employees of employer groups on a fully employee-funded basis. In some cases, the Company bills the covered individual directly. Inaddition, effective J
anuary 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) in eight states through which it sellsInsured plans directly to 
individual consumers.The Company offers Insured Medic
are coverage on an individual basis as well as through employer groups to their retirees. Medicaid and CHIP members areenrolled on an individual bas
is. The Company also offers Insured health care coverage to members who are dually-eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.Health Care Benefits products 
are sold through: the Company’s sales personnel; independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production andservicing of business; as well 
as private health insurance exchanges (“Private Exchanges”) and Public Exchanges (together with Private Exchanges, “InsuranceExchanges”). For large employ
ers or other entities that sponsor the Company’s products (“plan sponsors”), independent consultants and brokers are frequentlyinvolved in employer heal
th plan selection decisions and sales. In some instances, the Company may pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents,consultants and sales repr
esentatives who place business with the Company. In certain cases, the customer pays the broker for services rendered, and the Companymay facilitate 
that arrangement by collecting the funds from the customer and transmitting them to the broker. The Company supports marketing and sales effortswith an advertising 
program that may include television, radio, billboards, print media and social media, supplemented by market research and direct marketingefforts.
The U.S. federal government is a s
ignificant customer of the Health Care Benefits segment through contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligibleindividuals and federal 
employee-related benefit programs. Other than the contracts with CMS, the Health Care Benefits segment is not dependent upon a singlecustomer or a few custome
rs the loss of which would have a significant effect on the earnings of the segment. The loss of business from any one, or a few,independent brokers or agents would no
t have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the Health Care Benefits segment. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, HealthCare Benefits segment rev
enues from the federal government accounted for 14%, 13% and 13%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total revenues.Contracts with CMS for coverage of Med
icare-eligible individuals in the Health Care Benefits segment accounted for approximately 79%, 78% and 76%,respectively, of the Company
’s consolidated revenues from the federal government in 2021, 2020 and 2019.Health Care Benefits Pricing
For Commercial Insured plans, 
contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period andtypically have a durat
ion of one year. Fees under ASC plans are generally fixed for a period of one year.Generally, a fixed prem
ium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period for Commercial Insured plans. The Company typically cannot recoverunanticipated incre
ases in health care and other benefit costs in the current policy period; however, it may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregateor for a specific customer,
 among other factors, in5

determining premium rates for future policy periods. Where required by state laws, premium rates are filed and approved by state regulators prior to contractinception. Future operating 
results could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval isdelayed by state or fede
ral regulators.The Company has Medicare Advantage 
and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certaingeographic areas. Under thes
e annual contracts, CMS pays the Company a fixed per member (or “capitation”) payment and/or a portion of the premium, both ofwhich are based on membership 
and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors. CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and averageper capita fee-for-service Medicare co
sts in the calculation of the fixed capitation payment or premium. PDP contracts also provide a risk-sharing arrangementwith CMS to limit the Company’s exposure 
to unfavorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses. Amounts payable to the Company under the Medicarearrangements are subj
ect to annual revision by CMS, and the Company elects to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis. Premiumspaid to the Company for Medica
re products are subject to federal government reviews and audits, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive andprospective premium ad
justments and refunds to the government and/or members. In addition to payments received from CMS, some Medicare Advantageproducts and all PDP products require 
a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer. In some cases these supplemental premiumsare adjusted based on the m
ember’s income and asset levels. Compared to Commercial Medical products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member permonth revenues and higher hea
lth care and other benefit costs.The Patient Protection and Affo
rdable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) ties a portion of eachMedicare Advantage plan’s 
reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments.CMS released the Company’s 2022 star r
atings in October 2021. The Company’s 2022 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company’s MedicareAdvantage plans have ratings of 
four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2023. Based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2021, 87% ofthe Company’s Medicare Advantag
e members were in plans with 2022 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 83% of the Company’s Medicare Advantagemembers being in plans with 2021 st
ar ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2020.Rates for Medicare Supplem
ent products are regulated at the state level and vary by state and plan.Under Insured Medicaid contr
acts, state government agencies pay the Company fixed monthly rates per member that vary by state, line of business anddemographics; and the Company a
rranges, pays for and manages the health care services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. These rates are subject to change byeach state, and, in some ins
tances, provide for adjustment for health risk factors. CMS requires these rates to be actuarially sound. The Company also receivesfees from customers wher
e it provides services under ASC Medicaid contracts. ASC Medicaid contracts generally are for periods of more than one year, andcertain of them contain performa
nce incentives and limited financial risk sharing with respect to certain medical, financial and operational metrics. Under thesearrangements, performance is e
valuated annually, with associated financial incentive opportunities, and financial risk share obligations are typically limited to apercentage of the fe
es otherwise payable to the Company. Payments to the Company under Medicaid contracts are subject to the annual appropriation process inthe applicable state.
Under Duals contracts, the ra
te setting process is generally established by CMS in partnership with the state government agency participating in thedemonstration project. Both CMS and th
e state government agency may seek premium and other refunds under certain circumstances, including if the Companyfails to comply with CMS regulat
ions or other contractual requirements.The Company offers HMO and consumer-dir
ected medical and dental plans to federal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Programand the Federal Employees Dent
al and Vision Insurance Program. Premium rates and fees for those plans are subject to federal government review and audit,which can result, and have resu
lted, in retroactive and prospective premium and fee adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members.Beginning in 2014, the ACA imposed significant n
ew industry-wide fees, assessments and taxes, including an annual levy known as the health insurer fee (the“HIF”). The HIF applied for 2020 and was tempo
rarily suspended for 2019. In December 2019, the HIF was repealed for calendar years after 2020. For additionalinformation on the ACA fees, assessm
ents and taxes, see Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. The Company’s goal is tocollect premiums and 
fees where possible, or solve for, all of the ACA-related fees, assessments and taxes.6

Health Care Benefits SeasonalityThe Health Care Benefits segm
ent’s quarterly operating income progression is also impacted by (i) the seasonality of benefit costs which generally increase duringthe year as Insured memb
ers progress through their annual deductibles and out-of-pocket expense limits and (ii) the seasonality of operating expenses, which aregenerally the highest dur
ing the fourth quarter due primarily to spending to support readiness for the start of the upcoming plan year and marketing associated withMedicare annual enrollment.
During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2021, the customary quarterly operating income progression was impacted by COVID-19. While overall medical costs in thefirst quarter were gen
erally consistent with historical baseline levels in the aggregate, the segment experienced increased COVID-19 testing and treatment costs andlower Medicare risk-ad
justed revenue. During the second quarter, COVID-19 testing and treatment costs persisted, however at levels significantly lower than thoseobserved during the first qua
rter. Beginning in the third quarter, medical costs once again increased primarily driven by the spread of the emerging new variants ofCOVID-19, which resulted in increased t
esting and treatment costs that continued throughout the fourth quarter.During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2020, the customary quarterly operating income progression was also impacted by COVID-19. Beginning in mid-March, thehealth care system experienced
 a significant reduction in utilization that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures. Utilization remainedbelow historical levels 
through April, began to recover in May and June and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters, with select geographiesimpacted by COVID-19 waves. The impact of 
the deferral of non-essential care was partially offset by COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, as well as plannedCOVID-19 related investments.
Health Care Benefits Competition
The health care benefits in
dustry is highly competitive, primarily due to a large number of for-profit and not-for-profit competitors, competitors’ marketing andpricing and a prolifer
ation of competing products, including new products that are continually being introduced into the marketplace. New entrants into themarketplace, as well 
as consolidation within the industry, have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment. In addition, the rapid paceof change as the industry evolv
es towards a consumer-focused retail marketplace, including Insurance Exchanges, and the increased use of technology to interactwith members, providers and cus
tomers, increase the risks the Company currently faces from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors comparedto prior periods.
The Company believes that the s
ignificant factors that distinguish competing health plans include the perceived overall quality (including accreditation status),quality of service, comp
rehensiveness of coverage, cost (including premium rates, provider discounts and member out-of-pocket costs), product design, financialstability and ratings, br
eadth and quality of provider networks, ability to offer different provider network options, providers available in such networks, andquality of member support 
and care management programs. The Company believes that it is competitive on each of these factors. The Company’s ability toincrease the number of p
ersons covered by its health plans or to increase Health Care Benefits segment revenues is affected by its ability to differentiate itselffrom its competitors on t
hese factors. Competition may also affect the availability of services from providers, including primary care physicians, specialists andhospitals.
Insured products compete with 
local and regional health care benefits plans, health care benefits and other plans sponsored by other large commercial health carebenefit insurance comp
anies, health system owned health plans, new entrants into the marketplace and numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizationsoperating under licenses 
from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The largest competitor in Medicare products is Original Medicare. Additional HealthCare Benefits segment comp
etitors include other types of medical and dental provider organizations, various specialty service providers (including pharmacybenefit management (“PBM”)
 services providers), health care consultants, financial services companies, integrated health care delivery organizations (networksof providers who also coordinate 
administrative services for and assume insurance risk of their members), third party administrators (“TPAs”), HIT companiesand, for certain plans, prog
rams sponsored by the federal or state governments. Emerging competitors include start up health care benefits plans, technologycompanies, provider-owned hea
lth plans, new joint ventures (including not-for-profit joint ventures among firms from multiple industries), technology firms,financial services firms that are 
distributing competing products on their proprietary Private Exchanges, and consulting firms that are distributing competingproducts on their propriet
ary Private Exchanges, as well as non-traditional distributors such as retail companies. The Company’s ability to increase the number ofpersons enrolled in Insured Comm
ercial Medical products also is affected by the desire and ability of employers to self-fund their health coverage.7

The Health Care Benefits segment’s ASC plans compete primarily with other large commercial health care benefit companies, numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations ope
rating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and TPAs.The Health Care Benefits segm
ent’s international products compete with local, global and U.S.-based health plans and commercial health care benefit insurancecompanies, many of whom are l
icensed in more geographies and have a longer operating history, better brand recognition and greater marketplace presence inone or more geographies.
The provider solutions and HIT mark
etplaces and products are evolving rapidly. The Company competes for provider solutions and HIT business with other largehealth plans and commercial 
health care benefit insurance companies as well as information technology companies and companies that specialize in providersolutions and HIT. Many information 
technology product competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition, greater marketplace presence andmore experience in dev
eloping innovative products.In addition to competit
ive pressures affecting the Company’s ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, the Health Care Benefits segment’smedical membership h
as been and may continue to be adversely affected by adverse and/or uncertain economic conditions and reductions in workforce by existingcustomers due to adverse and
/or uncertain general economic conditions, especially in the United States and industries where such membership is concentrated.Health Care Benefits Reinsurance
The Company
  currently has several reinsurance agreements with non-affiliated insurers that relate to Health Care Benefits insurance policies. The Companyentered into these cont
racts to reduce the risk of catastrophic losses which in turn reduces capital and surplus requirements. The Company frequently evaluatesreinsurance opportunities
 and refines its reinsurance and risk management strategies on a regular basis.Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t provides a full range of PBM solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retailpharmacy network managem
ent services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacyand infusion services
, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providersand federal 340B drug pricing prog
ram covered entities (“Covered Entities”). The Pharmacy Services segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurancecompanies, unions, government e
mployee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care (“Managed Medicaid”) plans, plans offered on Insurance Exchangesand other sponsors of health bene
fit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment includes retail specialty pharmacystores, specialty mai
l order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2021, the Company’s PBM filled or managed 2.2 billion prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis.PBM Services
The Company dispenses prescription d
rugs directly through its mail order dispensing and specialty mail order pharmacies and through pharmacies in its retailnetwork. All prescriptions proc
essed by the Company are analyzed, processed and documented by the Company’s proprietary prescription management systems.These systems provide essenti
al features and functionality to allow plan members to utilize their prescription drug benefits. These systems also streamline theprocess by which prescriptions a
re processed by staff and network pharmacists by enhancing review of various items through automation, including plan eligibility,early refills, duplicate dispe
nsing, appropriateness of dosage, drug interactions or allergies, over-utilization and potential fraud.Plan Design Offerings and Administration
The Company assists its PBM clients in des
igning pharmacy benefit plans that help improve health outcomes while minimizing the costs to the client. TheCompany also assists PBM clients in moni
toring the effectiveness of their plans through frequent, informal communications, the use of proprietary software, aswell as through formal annua
l, quarterly and sometimes monthly performance reviews. The Company administers pharmacy benefit plans for clients who contractwith it to facilitate prescriptio
n drug coverage and claims processing for their eligible plan members. The Company also provides administrative services forCovered Entities.
8

The Company makes recommendations to help PBM clients design benefit plans that promote the use of lower cost, clinically appropriate drugs and helps its PBMclients control costs by r
ecommending plan designs that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available. Clientsalso have the option, through plan d
esign, to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products ontheir drug lists or “for
mularies,” which helps guide members to choose lower cost alternatives through appropriate financial incentives.Formulary Management
The Company utilizes an independ
ent panel of doctors, pharmacists and other medical experts, referred to as the CVS Caremark National Pharmacy andTherapeutics Committe
e, to review and approve the selection of drugs that meet the Company’s standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on one of theCompany’s template formu
laries. The Company’s formularies provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to help ensure member access to clinicallyappropriate drugs with alt
ernatives within a class under the client’s pharmacy benefit plan, while helping to drive the lowest net cost for clients that select one ofthe Company’s formularies. To h
elp improve clinical outcomes for members and clients, the Company conducts ongoing, independent reviews of all drugs,including those appearing on th
e formularies and generic equivalent products. Many of the Company’s clients choose to adopt a template formulary offering as partof their plan design. PBM clients 
are given capabilities to offer real time benefits information for a member’s specific plan design, provided digitally at the point ofprescribing, at the CVS pharmacy 
and directly to members.Retail Pharmacy Network
 Management ServicesThe Company maintains a nation
al network of approximately 66,000 retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately 40,000 chain pharmacies (which includes CVSPharmacy locations) and app
roximately 26,000 independent pharmacies, in the United States, including Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S.Virgin Islands. When a custome
r fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to the Company from the point-of-sale. This data interfaces 
with the Company’s proprietary prescription management systems, which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility, while alsoperforming a drug utilizatio
n review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for theprescription. The Company also of
fers a performance program for non-Medicare customers, which can be implemented with either the Company’s broad, nationalnetwork or with any managed network (
as allowed by applicable laws and regulations). Under the program, high performing pharmacies are eligible to receive anincremental positiv
e performance payment. The program aligns with key Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set measures utilized by CMS and is fundedby client fees. 
Mail Order Pharmacy Services
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t operates mail order dispensing pharmacies in the United States. Plan members or their prescribers submit prescriptions or refillrequests, primarily for mainte
nance medications, to these pharmacies, and staff pharmacists review these prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of theCompany’s prescription manag
ement systems. This review may involve communications with the prescriber and, with the prescriber’s approval when required, canresult in generic substi
tution, therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to help reduce cost and/or improve quality of treatment. The Company’s mail orderdispensing pharmacies have b
een awarded Mail Service Pharmacy accreditation from URAC.Specialty Pharmacy and Infusion Serv
icesThe Pharmacy Services
 segment operates specialty mail order pharmacies, retail specialty pharmacy stores and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition servicesin the United States. The speci
alty mail order pharmacies are used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases anddisorders. The Company’s special
ty mail order pharmacies have been awarded Specialty Pharmacy accreditation from URAC. Substantially all of the Company’sspecialty mail orde
r pharmacies also have been accredited by The Joint Commission and the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (“ACHC”), which areindependent, not-for-prof
it organizations that accredit and certify health care programs and organizations in the United States. The ACHC accreditation includes anadditional accredi
tation by the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board, which certifies compliance with the highest level of pharmacy compoundingstandards.
Clinical Services
The Company offers
 multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner.These programs are primarily
 designed to promote better health outcomes and to help target inappropriate medication utilization and non-adherence to medication,each of which may result in 
adverse medical events that negatively affect member health and client pharmacy and medical spend. These programs includeutilization manage
ment (“UM”), medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design andclinical strateg
ies. To help address prescription opioid abuse and misuse, the Company introduced an industry-leading UM approach that limits to seven days thesupply of opioids dispensed for cer
tain acute prescriptions for patients who9

are new to therapy, limits the daily dosage of opioids dispensed based on the strength of the opioid and requires the use of immediate-release formulations ofopioids before extended-r
elease opioids are dispensed. The Company’s Pharmacy Advisor program facilitates pharmacist co unseling, both face-to-face and overthe telephone, to help par
ticipating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere totheir prescribed med
ications and manage their health conditions. The Company also has digital connectivity that helps to lower drug costs for patients by providingexpanded visibility to lower 
cost alternatives through enhanced analytics and data sharing.Disease Management Programs

lients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part Dplans, Managed Medicaid plans 
and plans offered on Insurance Exchanges and other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and CoveredEntities. Pharmaceuticals are 
provided to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by clients and utilize the Company’s information systems, among otherthings, to help perform saf
ety checks, drug interaction screening and identify opportunities for generic substitution. Substantially all of the Pharmacy Servicessegment’s revenues are g
enerated from dispensing and managing prescription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by clients.Pharmacy Services Seasonality
The majority of Pharmacy Se
rvices segment revenues are not seasonal in nature.Pharmacy Services Competition
The Company believe
s the primary competitive factors in the pharmacy services industry include: (i) the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drugmanufacturers as well as t
o negotiate favorable discounts from, and access to, retail pharmacy networks; (ii) the ability to identify and apply effective costmanagement programs utilizing
 clinical strategies, including the development and utilization of preferred formularies; (iii) the ability to market PBM products andservices; (iv) the commitment

to provide flexible, clinically-oriented services to clients and be responsive to clients’ needs; (v) the quality, scope and costs of products and services offered toclients and their members; an
d (vi) operational excellence in delivering services. The Pharmacy Services segment has a significant number of competitors offeringPBM services, including large, na
tional PBM companies (e.g., Prime Therapeutics and MedImpact), PBMs owned by large national health plans (e.g., the ExpressScripts business of Cigna Corporation and 
the OptumRx business of UnitedHealth) and smaller standalone PBMs.Retail/LTC Segment
The Retail/LTC segment sells p
rescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care servicesthrough its MinuteClinic walk-
in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 andshingles and conducts long-ter
m care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and otherancillary services 
to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations,nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic loc
ations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. During the year ended December 31,2021, the Retail/LTC segment fi
lled 1.6 billion prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company dispensedapproximately 26.4% of the 
total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the United States.Retail/LTC Products and Services
A typical retail stor
e sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and proprietary brand merchandise.Pharmacy locations may a
lso contract with Covered Entities under the federal 340B drug pricing program. Front store categories include over-the-counter drugs,consumer health products, be
auty products and personal care products. LTC operations include distribution of prescription drugs and related consulting andancillary services. Th
e Company purchases merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors. The Company believes that competitive sources arereadily available 
for substantially all of the products carried in its retail stores and the loss of any one supplier would not likely have a material effect on theRetail/LTC segment. The Company’s Minu
teClinic locations offer a variety of health care services.Retail/LTC revenues by major p
roduct group are as follows:Percentage of Revenues
2021
2020 2019 Pharmacy 
76.0 % 76.9 % 76.7 % Front store and other 
24.0 % 23.1 % 23.3 % 100.0 
% 100.0 % 100.0 % (1)
Pharmacy includes LTC sales and sales in pharmacies within Target Corporation (“Target”) and other retail stores. (2)
“Other” represents less than 12% of the “Front store and other” revenue category in all periods presented. Pharmacy
Pharmacy revenues repres
ented approximately three-fourths of Retail/LTC segment revenues in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company believes that retailpharmacy operations will 
continue to represent a critical part of the Company’s business due to industry demographics, e.g., an aging American populationconsuming a greater numbe
r of prescription drugs, prescription drugs being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness, the introduction ofnew pharmaceutical produ
cts, the need for vaccinations, including the COVID-19 vaccination, and Medicare Part D growth. The Company believes the retailpharmacy business benefits 
from investment in both people and technology, as well as innovative collaborations with health plans, PBMs and providers. Given thenature of prescriptions, 
consumers want their prescriptions filled accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology, and ready whenpromised. Consumers also need med
ication management programs and better information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars. To assistconsumers with these
 needs, the Company has introduced integrated pharmacy health care services that provide an earlier, easier and more effective approach toengaging consumers in behaviors 
that can help lower costs, improve health and save lives.Front Store
Front store revenues refl
ect the Company’s strategy of innovating with new and unique products and services, using innovative personalized marketing andadjusting the mix of mer
chandise to match customers’ needs and preferences. A key component of the front store strategy is the ExtraCare card program, which is one of the largest and most su
ccessful retail loyalty programs in the United States. The ExtraCare program allows the Company to balance marketing efforts so itcan reward its best

ed nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations in the United States. The clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners andphysician assistants who utili
ze nationally established guidelines to deliver a variety of health care services. Payors value these clinics because they provideconvenient, high-qualit
y, cost-effective care, in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more expensive sites of care. MinuteClinic is collaborating with theHealth Care Benefits and Pharm
acy Services segments to help meet the needs of the Company’s health plan members and CVS Caremark’s client plan members byoffering programs that

tient drug therapy evaluations, to assist in compliance with state and federal regulations and provide proprietary clinical and healthmanagement programs. It als
o provides pharmaceutical case management services for retirees, employees and dependents who have drug benefits under corporate-sponsored health care progr
ams.Community Location Development
CVS Health’s community health dest
inations are an integral part of its ability to meet the needs of consumers and maintain its leadership position in the changinghealth care landscap
e. When paired with its rapidly expanding digital presence, the Company’s physical presence in thousands of communities across the countryrepresents a competi
tive advantage by allowing it to develop deep and trusted relationships through everyday engagement in consumer health. The Company’scommunity health destin
ations have played, and will continue to play, a key role in the Company’s continued growth and success. During 2021, the Companyopened approximately 55 new com
munity locations, relocated approximately 15 locations, converted approximately 300 locations into CVS HealthHUB locationsand closed approximately 80 
locations.The Company’s continuous assessment of 
its national footprint is an essential component of competing effectively in the current health care environment. On anongoing basis, the Company evaluates 
changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs to assess the ability of its existing stores andlocations to meet the n
eeds of its consumers and the business. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail businessand announced its plans to reduc
e store density in certain locations through the closure of approximately 900 stores between 2022 and 2024.As part of the Company’s strateg
ic review of its retail business, CVS Health will also create new store formats to drive higher engagement with consumers. Threedistinct models will serv
e as community health destinations: (a) sites dedicated to offering primary care services; (b) an enhanced version of CVS HealthHUBlocations with products and serv

Retail/LTC Information SystemsThe Company has continued to invest in 
information systems to enable it to deliver exceptional customer service, enhance safety and quality, and expand patientcare services while lowe
ring operating costs. The proprietary WeCARE Workflow tool supports pharmacy teams by prioritizing work to meet customerexpectations, facilitating prescri
ber outreach, and seamlessly integrating clinical programs. This solution delivers improved efficiency and enhances customerexperience, as well as prov
ides a framework to accommodate the evolution of pharmacy practice and the expansion of clinical programs. Our Health EngagementEngine technology a
nd data science clinical algorithms enable the Company to help identify opportunities for pharmacists to deliver face-to-face counselingregarding patient hea
lth and safety matters, including medication adherence issues, gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions. TheCompany’s digital strategy

lity and convenience. The Company’s LTC digital technology suite, Omniview, improves the effici ency of customers’ operations with toolsthat include executive das
hboards, pre-admission pricing, electronic ordering of prescription refills, proof-of-delivery tracking, access to patient profiles, receiptand management of facility bill
s, and real-time validation of Medicare Part D coverage, among other capabilities.Through the collaboration of 
its digital and technical teams, the Company has established critical tools which enable patients to schedule COVID-19 diagnostictesting and vaccination 
appointments through CVS.com and MinuteClinic.com. Key elements of the offerings include landing pages which highlight services andanswer common questi
ons, screening capabilities to determine patient eligibility, service location locator and appointment selection tools to efficiently identify therequested service on a 
specified date, time, and location and registration pages to collect required patient information, accelerating the administration of the test orvaccine once at the sto
re. Once scheduled, the tools provide the user with instructions and notifications including SMS text message and email reminders, and,following administration, 
also provide digital results for tests and records for vaccinations, enabling patients to view and save their medical records for convenientaccess at a later point.
Retail/LTC Customers
The success of the Retail/LTC seg
ment’s businesses is dependent upon the Company’s ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pharmacybenefit managers and oth
er payors on acceptable terms. Substantially all of the Retail/LTC segment’s pharmacy revenues are derived from pharmacy benefitmanagers, managed car
e organizations (“MCOs”), government funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third-party payors. No singleRetail/LTC payor accounted fo
r 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated total revenues in 2021, 2020 or 2019.Retail/LTC Seasonality
The majority of Retail
/LTC segment revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, generally are not seasonal in nature. However, front store revenues tend to behigher during the December ho
liday season. In addition, both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and fluseason. Uncharacteristi
c or extreme weather conditions also can adversely affect consumer shopping patterns and Retail/LTC revenues, expenses and operatingresults.
During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2021, the customary quarterly operating income progression continued to be impacted by COVID-19. During the first quarter,the Company experienced redu
ced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies, which reflected the impact of a weak cough, cold and flu season, while it administeredthe highest quarterly volu
me of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. During the second quarter, the segment generated earnings from COVID-19 vaccinations and sawimproved customer tra
ffic as vaccinated customers began more actively shopping in CVS locations. During the third and fourth quarters, emerging new variantsdrove the continued adminis
tration of COVID-19 vaccinations (including booster shots), which reached their highest levels of the year during the fourth quarter,and diagnostic testing. During th
e third and fourth quarters, the segment also generated earnings from the sale of OTC test kits in the front store.During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2020, the customary quarterly operating income progression was also impacted by COVID-19. During March 2020, theCompany experienced great
er use of 90-day prescriptions, early refills of maintenance medications and increased front store volume as consumers prepared for theCOVID-19 pandemic. Subsequent to March 2020, the Company 
experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due toshelter-in-place o
rders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the third quarter, the Company saw anincrease in diagnostic 
testing related to the COVID-19 pandemic and in December 2020, the Company began administering COVID-19 vaccinations in long-termcare facilities.

Retail/LTC CompetitionThe retail pharmacy bus
iness is highly competitive. The Company believes that it competes principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience,(ii) customer servi
ce and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety, and (iv) price. In the areas it serves, the Company competes with other drugstore chains(e.g., Walgreens and Rite Aid), sup
ermarkets, discount retailers (e.g., Walmart), independent pharmacies, restrictive pharmacy networks, internet companies (e.g.,Amazon), membership clu
bs, retail health clinics, urgent care and primary care offices, as well as mail order dispensing pharmacies.LTC pharmacy services are h
ighly regional or local in nature, and within a given geographic area of operation, highly competitive. The Company’s largest LTCpharmacy competitor n
ationally is PharMerica. The Company also competes with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned bylong-term care facilities and local retail
 pharmacies. Some states have enacted “freedom of choice” or “any willing provider” requirements as part of their stateMedicaid programs or in
 separate legislation, which may increase the competition that the Company faces in providing services to long-term care facility residentsin these states.
Corporate/Other Segment
The Company presents the rema
inder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•
Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and thecorporate relations, 
legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’sinvestments in its trans
formation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related integration costs; and•
Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.14

Generic Sourcing VentureThe Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. 
(“Cardinal”) each have a 50% ownership in Red Oak Sourcing, LLC (“Red Oak”), a generic pharmaceutical sourcingentity. Under this arrange
ment, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiategeneric pharmaceut
ical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak. Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company.Working Capital Practices
The Company funds the growth of its businesses 
through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, proceedsfrom sale-leaseba
ck transactions and long-term borrowings. For additional information on the Company’s working capital practices, see “Liquidity and CapitalResources” in the MD&A included in I
tem 7 of this 10-K. Employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, providers,governmental units, governm
ent-sponsored plans (with the exception of Medicare Part D services, which are described below), labor groups and expatriates, whichrepresent the vast ma
jority of Health Care Benefits segment revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. As a provider of Medicare Part D services, the Companycontracts annually with CMS. Utili
zation of services each plan year results in the accumulation of either a receivable from or a payable to CMS. The timing ofsettlement of the r
eceivable or payable with CMS takes several quarters, which impacts working capital from year to year. The majority of the Retail/LTC segmentnon-pharmacy revenues ar

less than 30 days. The remainder of the Company’s consolidated pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards.Human Capital
Overview
At CVS Health, we share a single, clear pu
rpose: bringing our heart to every moment of your health. We devote significant time and attention to the attraction,development and retent
ion of talent to deliver high levels of service to our customers. Our commitment to them includes a competitive rewards package andprograms that support our dive
rse range of colleagues in rewarding and fulfilling careers. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 300,000colleagues primari
ly in the United States including in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, approximately 72% of whom were full-time.We believe engaged col
leagues produce stronger business results and are more likely to build a career with the Company. Each year we conduct an internalengagement survey that prov
ides colleagues with an opportunity to share their opinions and experiences with respect to their role, their team and the enterprise tohelp our Board and our managemen
t identify areas where we can improve colleague experience. The survey covers a broad range of topics including developmentand opportunities, diversity 
management, recognition, performance, well-being, compliance and continuous improvement. In 2021, greater than 80% of ourcolleagues particip
ated in the engagement survey, of which greater than 75% responded that they were actively engaged.The Board and our chief execut
ive officer (“CEO”) provide oversight of our human capital strategy, which consists of the following categories: total rewards;diversity, equity and inclus
ion; colleague development; and health and safety.Total Rewards
We recognize how vital our 
colleagues are to our success and strive to offer comprehensive and competitive wages and benefits to meet the varying needs of ourcolleagues and their f
amilies. The benefits and programs include annual bonuses, 401(k) plans, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, health care andinsurance benefits, paid 
time off, flexible work schedules, family leave, dependent care resources, colleague assistance programs and tuition assistance, amongmany others, depending on eligib
ility.In recognition of the cr
itical role that the attraction and retention of talent plays in the success of our business, during 2021, we also announced a significantinvestment in our employe
es through an increase in the Company’s minimum hourly wage to $15.00 an hour effective July 2022, with incremental increases to theCompany’s competitive hourly 
rates beginning in August 2021. The new wage structure also incorporates additional increases beyond the $15.00 minimum, withhigher starting hourly ra
tes for roles such as pharmacy technicians and call center representatives. In addition, during 2021 we awarded incremental15

bonuses to select colleague groups in recognition of their ongoing contributions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the most significant of which includedbonuses to our pharmacist and dis
tribution center colleagues.Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We believe that a div
erse workforce creates a healthier, stronger and more sustainable company. We aim to attract, develop, retain and support a diverse workforcethat reflects the 
many customers, patients, members and communities we serve. Our Diversity Management Leadership Council, a cross-functional group of seniorleaders appointed by our CEO, works with our Stra
tegic Diversity Management leadership team to intentionally embed diversity across all facets of our business.For our efforts, we have been re
cognized as a DiversityInc Top 50 Company, a LatinaStyle Top 50 Company for Latinas and earned a 100 percent score on boththe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equa
lity Index as well as the Disability Equality Index, meaning the company is recognized as a “Best Place to Work forDisability Inclusion.” The Company d
iscloses information on our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy and programs in our annual Corporate SocialResponsibility (“CSR”) Report.
As a foundation of diversity and in
clusion, we continuously focus on increasing underrepresented populations across our business. In 2021, 71% of our totalcolleague population and 55% o
f our colleagues at the manager level and above self-reported as female. In addition, in 2021 our colleagues reported theirrace/ethnicity as
: White (49%), Black/African American (17%), Hispanic/Latino (15%), Asian (11%) and Other (8%). The appendix to our CSR Report, ourStrategic Diversity Manag
ement Report and our EEO-1 Employer Information Report include additional information on the diversity of our workforce.Our diversity management
 strategy emphasizes workplace representation, inclusion and belonging, talent acquisition and management and a diverse marketplace.We incorporated a dive
rsity metric into our 2021 annual cash incentive program for our most senior leaders who have the greatest ability to influence the overallhiring, development and promo
tion of our colleagues. We also continued the deployment of conscious inclusion training for colleagues designed to enhanceawareness of biases and support in
clusive behaviors. Our CSR Report includes additional information with respect to our conscious inclusion training. We support16 Colleague Resource Groups (“CRGs”) that in
clude more than 26,000 colleagues across the enterprise. These groups represent a wide range of professional,cultural, ethical 
and personal affinities and interests, as well as formal mentoring programs. Our CRGs provide our colleagues with an opportunity to connect andnetwork with one another through a pa
rticular affinity, culture or interest. Each of our CRGs is sponsored by a senior leader.Colleague Development
The Company offers a number of r
esources and programs that attract, engage, develop, advance and retain colleagues. Training and development providescolleagues the support they n
eed to perform well in their current role while planning and preparing for future roles. We offer an online orientation program thatpairs new hires with seasoned col
leagues and the training continues throughout a colleague’s career through in-person, virtual and self-paced learning at all levels.We also provide mentoring, 
tools and workshops for colleagues to manage their career development. We offer a variety of management and leadership programsthat develop incumbent div
erse and other high potential colleagues. Our broad training practices include updated, tech-enabled tools and keep our colleaguesinformed of new developments 
in our industry that are relevant to their roles. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our colleagues invested more than13 million hours in learning 
and development courses.Our colleague development p
rogram also promotes the importance of compliance across our business. Our colleagues demonstrate this commitment through ourannual Code of Conduct training, which 100% o
f active colleagues completed in 2021. In 2021, we launched more than 70 different training courses as part of ourannual Enterprise Complian
ce Training Program.Health & Safety
We have a strong commit
ment to providing a safe working environment. We have implemented an environmental health and safety management system to supportadherence and monitoring o
f programs designed to make our various business operations compliant with applicable occupational safety and health regulations andrequirements. Our Environmen
tal Health and Safety Department oversees the implementation and adherence to programs like Powered Industrial Truck training,materials handling and s
torage, selection of personal protective equipment and workplace violence prevention.We utilize Safety Serv
ice Plans to analyze data and concentrate on key areas of risk to reduce the chance of workplace incidents. We focus on identifying causesand improving performanc
e when workplace incidents occur. We also engage leaders16

in promoting a culture of safety. With safety task forces in place at each distribution center, we empower leaders and safety business partners to identify policies,procedures and processes tha
t could improve their own operations.From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we 
took a comprehensive approach to managing occupational health and safety challenges presented by the pandemic,including implementing 
facial covering requirements for our workplaces and providing face masks to colleagues, providing sick leave, implementing symptomscreening measures and i
mplementing additional protocols in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) requirementsand guidance and Centers for Dise
ase Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidelines for workplaces. We have emphasized the importance of taking immediate stepstoward full vaccination.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Strategy
Overview
CVS Health believes the health of ou
r people, communities and planet are linked to the health of our business. Our ESG strategy is designed to use our assets totransform the health 
care experience and invest in community health at the local level, while working to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. OurESG strategy includes a set of goa
ls we hope to achieve in 2030 or earlier. We believe these goals are achievable without materially adversely affecting ourbusinesses, operating results, 
cash flows and/or prospects. Our ESG strategy consists of four pillars: Healthy People , Healthy Business, Healthy Community and Healthy Planet
. Healthy People
Through physical and virtual in
teractions, we provide convenient, personalized and integrated access to health care support and services. We continue to implementand expand initiatives t
hat build on our innovative health care model, with the ultimate aim to transform the health care experience for every person we reach toimprove health outcomes. Th
ese include helping to improve chronic disease prevention and management, helping to reduce and prevent prescription drug misuse,and improving the social de
terminants of health, which include education, transportation and behavioral health. Through our ESG strategy we are focused on ourinteraction with individu
als across all our touchpoints to increase the likelihood that these initiatives will succeed.Healthy Business
As we work to transform health ca
re, we are committed to operating a healthy business for all our stakeholders, including our patients, customers, stockholders,clients, partners, com
munities and colleagues. Throughout our large operational footprint and including our supply chain, we are committed to acting responsiblywith respect for human righ
ts, privacy, information security, public policy, marketing and advertising. We focus on diversity, equity and inclusion as well ascolleague development, h
ealth and safety. Through our ESG strategy we will be investing in colleague mentoring, sponsorship, development and advancement;workforce initiatives 
that provide employment services and training to the underserved; and providing access to health care while addressing health disparities.Healthy Community
By working with community-focused organ
izations and through innovative programs that can be tailored to and executed across different communities, we aredriving positive health out
comes and reducing overall health care costs. Through our recently announced Health Zones initiative, CVS Health and our nonprofitpartners are working togeth
er to create a model that reduces health disparities, promotes and enhances equity and ensures at-risk communities can thrive. Throughour ESG strategy we are building hea
lthier communities through social impact investments, such as supporting health care professionals, reducing food insecurity,engaging our customers in com
munity health, and coordinating care for the underserved.Healthy Planet
Our work to improve the planet is 
aligned with our commitment to the communities we serve and to help protect our businesses from the negative impacts ofclimate change. All of ou
r businesses, including our community locations, corporate offices and operation centers, distribution centers, and specialty pharmacy andPBM mail pharmacy locati
ons, can be impacted by climate change-related extreme weather events and we are doing our part to reduce our environmental impacts.We are focused on identi
fying resource efficiencies across our operations and supply chain. We are proud to be recognized as a leader in addressing climate-relatedissues and are working closely with k
ey stakeholders to make and deliver meaningful progress. Key17

priorities include the advancement of our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions-reduction targets, reduction in our energy consumption, the advancement ofsustainability in transpo
rtation, logistics and our physical locations, which includes retrofitting community and corporate locations with LED lighting, exploringinvestments in renewable 
energy, reducing water use, focusing on smarter consumption through a “digital first” approach and the reduction of our use of paper andplastic. In October 2021, CVS Health’s sci
ence-based net zero GHG emissions targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiatives (“SBTi”). Wecontinue to make meaning
ful progress to reduce our environmental impact.Intellectual Property
The Company has registered and/o
r applied to register a variety of trademarks and service marks used throughout its businesses, as well as domain names, andrelies on a combination o
f copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, in addition to contractual restrictions, to establish and protect the Company’sproprietary rights. The Company 
regards its intellectual property as having significant value in the Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTCsegments. The Company is not aware of 
any facts that could materially impact the continuing use of any of its intellectual property.Government Regulation
Overview
The Company’s operations are subj
ect to comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and comparable multiple levels of international regulation inthe jurisdictions in which i
t does business. There also continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by federal, state and international regulators of thehealth and related ben
efits industry’s business and reporting practices. In addition, many of the Company’s PBM clients and the Company’s payors in theRetail/LTC segment, including 
insurers, Medicare plans, Managed Medicaid plans and MCOs, are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the designand implementation of p
rescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor. Similarly, the Company’s LTC clients, such as skilled nursing facilities, are subject togovernment regulations, in
cluding many of the same government regulations to which the Company is subject.The laws and rules governing the Company
’s businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year andare subject to frequen
t change. The application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of the Company’s businesses createsareas of uncertainty. Fur
ther, there are numerous proposed health care, financial services and other laws and regulations at the federal, state and international levels,some of which could adversely a
ffect the Company’s businesses if they are enacted. The Company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or statelegislation or court pro
ceedings will change aspects of how it operates in the specific markets in which it competes or the health care industry generally, but ifchanges occur, the impac
t of any such changes could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or stock price.Possible regulatory 
or legislative changes include the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring the Commercial, Medicare or Medicaidmarketplace; redu
cing payments to the Company in connection with Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible or special needs programs; increasing its involvement indrug reimbursement, pri
cing, purchasing, and/or importation; or changing the laws governing PBMs.The Company has internal contro
l policies and procedures and conducts training and compliance programs for its employees to help prevent, detect and correctprohibited practices. Howeve
r, if the Company’s employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing its international or other operations, it mayface investigations, pros
ecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Anyfailure or alleged 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations summarized below, or any adverse applications or interpretations of, or changes in, thelaws and regulations affe
cting the Company and/or its businesses, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition,cash flows and/or stock price. Se
e Item 3 of this 10-K, “Legal Proceedings,” for further information.The Company can give no assurance th
at its businesses, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected, or that theCompany will not be required to m
aterially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) theinterpretation or app
lication of existing laws or regulations, including the laws and regulations described in this Government Regulation section, as they may relateto one or more of the Company’s busin

The Families First Coronavirus Response Ac
t (the “Families First Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) wereenacted in March 2020. Each of 
the Families First Act and the CARES Act requires the Company to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, inmany cases without member 
cost-sharing, in its Insured Health Care Benefits products.The CARES Act also provides relief funding to p
roviders to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing, preparing for and/orresponding to COVID-19 (provided no other source 
is obligated to reimburse those expenses) or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to COVID-19. Under the CARES Act, the Company receives rei
mbursement for uninsured patients in connection with COVID-19 testing and vaccination as well asmonoclonal antibody trea
tment. Aside from such reimbursement, the Company has not requested any funding under the CARES Act. However, in the secondquarter of 2020, the Company rec
eived $43 million from the CARES Act provider relief fund, all of which was returned to the U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services (“HHS”) during the second qu
arter of 2020.The CARES Act also allows for the deferra
l of the payment of the employer share of Social Security taxes effective March 27, 2020 by permitting them to remitthe associated payments 
in two equal installments on or about December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. The Company elected to defer approximately$670 million of its Social Secu
rity tax payments during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company paid the first of two equal installments in December2021 and will remit the second 
installment on or about December 31, 2022, as required under the CARES Act.Congress enacted the Americ
an Rescue Plan Act in March 2021. Among other changes, as a result of this legislation, Public Exchange plan premium subsidiesincreased for low-incom
e individuals and became available to people with incomes higher than 400% of the federal poverty limit. These changes are currently ineffect through the re
mainder of 2022, and Congress may extend, or potentially make permanent, these policies in subsequent legislation, which could causecontinued shifts in enroll
ment into Public Exchange plans.In addition to the Famili
es First Act, the CARES Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act, the Company continues to experience new legislation, regulation,directives, orders and oth
er requirements from federal, state, county and municipal authorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These governmental actionshave included, but are not l
imited to, requirements to waive member cost-sharing associated with COVID-19 testing and treatment, provide coverage for additionalCOVID-19-related services, expand 
the use of telemedicine, extend grace periods for payments of premiums or limit coverage termination based on non-paymentof premiums or fees, mo
dify health benefits coverage eligibility rules to help maintain employee eligibility, and facilitate, accelerate or advance payments toproviders, and other
 requirements related to the public health emergency. These requirements may impact different areas of our business differently and fordifferent lengths of t
ime, and present financial implications with respect to implementing and unwinding our compliance with these new requirements.The Company has operations that f
all within the scope of COVID-19 vaccine requirements for federal contractors, certain health care workers, and therequirements of cer
tain jurisdictions such as New York City. Several of these are subject to judicial challenges. We are continuing to closely monitor and updateour practices in response 
to developments or changes in the COVID-19 vaccination policies established by various federal agencies as well as the several state- andmunicipal-specifi
c COVID-19 vaccine mandates that provide expanded exemptions, modifications, requirements or restrictions regarding employee vaccinations.We have a process for em
ployees to request a reasonable accommodation if they are unable to get vaccinated due to a medical condition, sincerely held religiousbelief, or any other leg
ally recognized exemption. Employees must apply and be approved for a reasonable accommodation in order to be exempt from thevaccination requirement.
Additionally, in December 2021, th
e Biden administration reiterated CARES Act guidance noting commercial health insurers are not required to cover workplaceor surveillance test
ing and announced several new directives and actions to combat COVID-19, including the expansion of free at-home testing to be covered bycommercial heal
th insurers for the remainder of the public health emergency. On January 10, 2022, the HHS announced that commercial health insurers must coverthe costs of up to eight rapid OTC COVID-19 test ki
ts per individual per 30-day period. This requirement will likely impact multiple business operations, includingincreasing benefit cos
ts in our commercial health insurance business and increasing revenues in our retail business. The requirement may also result in a decreasein more expensive tests and 
treatments, which could partially mitigate the increase in benefit costs in our commercial health insurance business. These impacts willbe highly dependent on the overa
ll supply of testing products.19

Table of ContentsThe impact of this governm
ental activity on the U.S. economy, consumer, customer and health care provider behavior and health care utilization patterns is beyondour knowledge and control. As a result, 
the financial and/or operational impact these COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on ourbusinesses, operating results, 
cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the collective impact could be material and adverse.Laws and Regulations Related to Multiple Segments of the Company’s Business
Laws Related to Reimbursement by Government Programs
 - The Company is subject to various federal and state laws concerning its submission of claims andother information to Medicare
, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs. Potential sanctions for violating these lawsinclude recoupment or red
uction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Such laws includ
e the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), the federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”), state false claims acts andanti-kickback statut
es in most states, the federal “Stark Law” and related state laws. In particular, the False Claims Act prohibits intentionally submitting,conspiring to submit, or causing 
to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, inconnection with reimburse
ment by federal government programs. In addition, any claim for government reimbursement also violates the False Claims Act where itresults from a violat
ion of the AKS.Both federal and state fal
se claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam  or “whistleblower” lawsuits on beh alf of the federal or state government.Participants in the hea
lth and related benefits industry, including the Company, frequently are subject to actions under the False Claims Act or similar state laws.The federal Stark Law
 generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient prescriptiondrugs, to any entity with which the physi
cian, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further prohibits theentity receiving a prohibite
d referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral.Various states have enact
ed similar laws.The ACA
 - The ACA significantly increas ed federal and state oversight of health plans. Among other requirements, it specifies minimum medical loss ratios(“MLRs”) for Commercial a
nd Medicare Insured products, specifies features required to be included in commercial benefit designs, limits commercial individualand small group rating
 and pricing practices, encourages additional competition (including potential incentives for new participants to enter the marketplace), andincludes regulations and pro
cesses that could delay or limit the Company’s ability to appropriately increase its health plan premium rates. This in turn couldadversely affect the Compa
ny’s ability to continue to participate in certain product lines and/or geographies that it serves today.In June 2021, the United States Supreme Cour
t dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety and issued anopinion preserving the ACA and its consume
r protections in its current form. Even though the ACA was deemed constitutional, there may nevertheless becontinued efforts to inva
lidate, modify, repeal or replace portions of it. In addition to litigation, parts of the ACA continue to evolve through the promulgation ofexecutive orders, legis
lation, regulations and guidance at the federal or state level. The Company expects the ACA, including potential changes thereto, to continueto significantly impa
ct its business operations and operating results, including pricing, medical benefit ratios (“MBRs”) and the geographies in which theCompany’s products are avail
able.Medicare Regulation - 
The Company’s Medicare Advantage p roducts compete directly with Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage products offered byother Medicare Advantage o
rganizations and Medicare Supplement products offered by other insurers. The Company’s Medicare PDP and Medicare Supplementproducts are products that M
edicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in Original Medicare purchase to enhance their Original Medicare coverage.The Company continues to expand the numb
er of counties in which it offers Medicare products. The Company has expanded its Medicare service area andproducts in 2022 and is seeking to substan
tially grow its Medicare membership, revenue and operating results over the next several years, including through growthin Medicare Supplement 
products. The anticipated organic expansion of the Medicare service area and Medicare products offered and the Medicare-relatedprovisions of the ACA significantly in
crease the Company’s exposure to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/orfunding or regulation of, the v
arious Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programsand/or new reforms or surcha
rges on existing programs. For example, the ACA requires minimum MLRs for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans of85%. If a Medicare Advantag
e or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to enroll newmembers. If a Medica
re Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS.20

Table of ContentsDue to potential lower util
ization of medical services by Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible certain Medicare Advantagecontracts may not mee
t the 85% MLR for consecutive years.The Company’s Medicare Advantage 
and PDP products are heavily regulated by CMS. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Companyand other private part
icipants in Medicare programs are complex, expensive to comply with and subject to change. For example, the Medicare AdvantageOverpayment Rule, issued in 2014, impl
emented the ACA requirements that Medicare Advantage and PDP plans report and refund to CMS overpayments thatthose plans receive fro
m CMS. Failure to notify overpayments to CMS could result in liability under the False Claims Act. The precise interpretation, impact andlegality of this rule 
are subject to pending litigation. Payments the Company receives from CMS for its Medicare Advantage and Part D businesses also are subjectto risk adjustment based on th
e health status of the individuals enrolled. Elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the U.S.Department of Justice (
the “DOJ”), the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the “OIG”) and CMS itself. Substantial changes in the risk adjustmentmechanism, including cha
nges that result from enforcement or audit actions, could materially affect the amount of the Company’s Medicare reimbursement,require the Company t
o raise prices or reduce the benefits offered to Medicare beneficiaries, and potentially limit the Company’s (and the industry’s) participationin the Medicare program.
The Company has invested signific
ant resources to comply with Medicare standards, and its Medicare compliance efforts will continue to require significantresources. CMS may seek premium 
and other refunds, prohibit the Company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in or refuse to passively enrollmembers in one or more of 
the Company’s Medicare or Medicare-Medicaid demonstration (historically known as “dual eligible”) plans, exclude us fromparticipating in one or m
ore Medicare, dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs and/or institute other sanctions and/or civil monetary penaltiesagainst the Company if it f
ails to comply with CMS regulations or its Medicare contractual requirements. The Company’s Medicare Supplement products areregulated at the state level an
d subject to similar significant compliance requirements and risks.In addition, in November 2020, the HHS rele
ased the final Rebate Rule (the “Rebate Rule”), which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution underthe AKS for rebates from pharm
aceutical companies to PBMs in Medicare Part D, replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefitpatients with high out-of-pock
et costs and to change the way PBMs are compensated. The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to the patient atthe point of sale and (ii
) for flat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. It is unclear whether the Rebate Rule will beenforceable, whether pha
rmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices, whether list prices in the private market may also be reduced, and what theresulting impact will b
e to PBMs or the Company. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (the “PCMA”), which represents PBMs, has filed a suit in aneffort to block the Rebat
e Rule, claiming that the Rebate Rule would lead to higher premiums in Medicare Part D and was adopted in an unlawful manner. TheBipartisan Infrastruc
ture Act of 2021 delays the effective date of the rebate rule to January 2026, and pending Reconciliation legislation would fully repeal theRebate Rule.
In December 2021, President Biden sign
ed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act. The legislation extends the suspension of the2% Medicare sequester 
cuts until March 2022. Starting in April 2022, the Medicare sequester cuts will be phased back in with a 1% cut that will continue throughJune. Absent any further changes by Congress, 
the 2% Medicare sequester would be fully implemented again effective July 1, 2022. Congress suspended theMedicare sequester cu
ts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a continued increase in Medicare Advantage and Part D plan payments, as well as Medicarefee-for-service p
rovider payments. The legislation also includes a 3% increase in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule payments for 2022. Congress enacted asimilar increase o
f 3.75% for 2021 which was set to expire. As a result of this increase, Medicare Advantage plans who have contracts with providers based on theMedicare Physician Fee Schedul
e will need to increase their payment rates by 3%. This increase became effective in January 2022 and does not include anyallowance for the incr
eased Medicare Advantage costs that result from the provision. Taken together, the two provisions represent a modest increase in MedicareAdvantage costs relative 
to our expectations for 2022.Currently, Congress is considering l
egislation to add additional benefits to Medicare Part B, such as dental, hearing and vision benefits. The Congressional BudgetOffice has not yet scored any o
f the proposals.Going forward, the Company expects CMS, the OIG, the DOJ, other 
federal agencies and the U.S. Congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component ofthe Medicare program 
(including Medicare Advantage, PDPs, demonstration projects such as Medicare-Medicaid plans and provider network access andadequacy), modify the te
rms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers’ roles. It is also possible that Congress mayreform the structur
e of the Medicare Part D program and may consider changes to Medicare Advantage payment policies due to recent recommendations by theMedicare Payment Advisory Commiss
ion and to reduce the potential added cost burden of costly new21

Table of Contentsbenefits, or policies that
 impact drug pricing such as price controls and inflationary rebates applied to pharmaceutical manufacturers.It is not possible to predic
t the outcome of such regulatory or Congressional activity, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company.Medicare Audits 
- CMS regularly audits the Company’s p erformance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and toassess the quality of servi
ces it provides to Medicare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries. For example, CMS conducts risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”)audits of a subset of Medica
re Advantage contracts for each contract year. Since 2011, CMS has selected certain of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contractsfor various years for RADV audit, and the nu
mber of RADV audits continues to increase. The OIG also is auditing the Company’s risk adjustment data and that ofother companies, and the Company 
expects CMS and the OIG to continue auditing risk adjustment data. The Company also has received Civil InvestigativeDemands (“CIDs”) from, and provided do
cuments and information to, the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with a current investigation of its patient chartreview processes in connect
ion with risk adjustment data submissions under Parts C and D of the Medicare program.In October 2018, CMS issued proposed rules rel
ated to, among other things, changes to the RADV audit methodology established by CMS in 2012. CMS projectsthat the changes to the RADV audit me
thodology would increase its recoveries from Medicare Advantage plans as a result of RADV audits. CMS has requestedcomments on the proposed rules, 
including whether the proposed RADV rule change should apply retroactively to audits of Medicare Advantage plans for contractyear 2011 and forward, and gave noti
ce that it has extended the timeline for publication of the final rules until November 2022. While the Company submittedtimely comments to th
e proposed rules, if they are adopted as proposed there may be potential adverse effects, which could be material, on the Company’soperating results, finan
cial condition, and cash flows. CMS also has announced that its goal is to subject all Medicare Advantage contracts to either acomprehensive or a targ
eted RADV audit for each contract year.Medicare Star Ratings
 - A portion of each Medicar e Advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings.” The star rating system considers a varietyof measures adopted by CMS, including qua
lity of preventative services, chronic illness management, compliance and overall customer satisfaction. OnlyMedicare Advantage plans with 
an overall star rating of four or more stars (out of five stars) are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. As aresult, the Company’s Medica
re Advantage plans’ operating results in 2022 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings. The Company’sstar ratings and past 
performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in its Medicare operations. CMS released theCompany’s 2022 star ratings in Octobe
r 2021. The Company’s 2022 star ratings will be used to determine which of its Medicare Advantage plans have ratings offour stars or higher and qual
ify for bonus payments in 2023. Based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2021, 87% of the Company’s MedicareAdvantage members were in pl
ans with 2022 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars. CMS also gives PDPs star ratings which affect each PDP’s enrollment. MedicareAdvantage and PDP plans that are rat
ed less than three stars for three consecutive years are subject to contract termination by CMS. CMS continues to revise itsstar ratings system to m
ake it harder to achieve four stars or more. Despite the Company’s success in achieving high 2022 star ratings and other quality measuresand the continuation of its 
improvement efforts, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years.Accordingly, the Company’s Medica
re Advantage plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans canoffer, reduce membership an
d/or reduce profit margins.Medicare Benchmark Rates
 - In January 2021, CMS issued its final not ice detailing final 2022 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates. Final 2022Medicare Advantage rates re
sulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%. This rate increase only partially offsets the challenge theCompany faces from the imp
act of the increasing cost of medical care (including prescription medications) and CMS local and national coverage decisions thatrequire the Company to pay for s
ervices and supplies that are not factored into the Company’s bids. The federal government may seek to impose restrictions on theconfiguration of pharma
cy or other provider networks for Medicare Advantage and/or PDP plans, or otherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits,negotiate prices or establis
h other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products. The Company currently believes that the payments it hasreceived and will rec
eive in the near term are adequate to justify the Company’s continued participation in the Medicare Advantage and PDP programs, althoughthere are economic 
and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the program, and this outlook could change.340B Drug Pricing Program
 – The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows eligib le Covered Entities to purchase prescription drugs from manufacturers at a steepdiscount, and is overseen by the HHS and the Hea
lth Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”). In 2020, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers beganprograms that limit
ed Covered Entities’ participation in the program through contract pharmacies arrangements. In May 2021, HRSA sent enforcement letters to22

Table of Contentsmultiple manufactu
rers to curb these practices. In September 2021, HRSA forwarded the enforcement actions to the OIG for potential imposition of civil monetarypenalties. Those enforce
ment actions are currently subject to ongoing litigation. A reduction in Covered Entities’ participation in contract pharmacy arrangements,as a result of the pending en
forcement actions or otherwise, a reduction in the use of the Company’s administrative services by Covered Entities, or a reduction indrug manufacturers’ participatio
n in the program could materially and adversely affect the Company.Anti-Remuneration Laws
 - Federal law prohibits, among o ther things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject tocertain exceptions and 
“safe harbors,” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which paymentmay be made under Medica
re, Medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which are notlimited to services p
aid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment, criminal andcivil fines, and exclusion 
from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs. Companies involved inpublic health care programs
 such as Medicare and/or Medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud, waste and abuse, and areoften the subject of fr
aud, waste and abuse investigations and audits. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with Medicare and Medicaidprogram standards. Ongoing vigorous law en
forcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the Company’s compliance efforts in this area willcontinue to require signi
ficant resources.Antitrust and Unfair Competition 
- The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfairmethods of competition.” Num
erous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies and/or PBMsunder various federal and s
tate antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging, among other things: (i) brand name drug pricing and rebate practices ofpharmaceutical m
anufacturers, (ii) the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by PBMs, and (iii) various other business practices of PBMs and retailpharmacies. In July 2021, the FTC approved s
everal resolutions that direct agency staff to use compulsory process, such as subpoenas, to investigate seven specificenforcement priorities. Priorit
y targets include, among other businesses, health care businesses, such as pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy benefits managersand hospitals. To the extent th
at the Company appears to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or CVS Pharmacy, CVS Specialty orMinuteClinic plays a unique or 
expanded role in a Health Care Benefits or Pharmacy Services segment product offering, the Company’s business arrangements anduses of confidential inf
ormation may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anti-competitive perspective and possible challenge by state and/or federalregulators and/or priva
te parties.Privacy and Confidentiality Requirements
 - Many of the Company’s activi ties involve the receipt, use and disclosure by the Company of personally identifiableinformation (“PII”) 
as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws, which require organizations to provide appropriateprivacy and security saf
eguards for such information. In addition to PII, the Company uses and discloses de-identified data for analytical and other purposes whenpermitted. Additionally, 
there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which are a set ofrequirements designed to
 help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. Certain states haveincorporated these requ
irements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use and/or disclosure of PII.The federal Health Insur
ance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”), as further modified by theAmerican Recovery and Reinvest
ment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, providers, health careclearinghouses (known as “cover
ed entities”) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information (“PHI”). Further, ARRArequires the Company and other 
covered entities to report any breaches of PHI to impacted individuals and to the HHS and to notify the media in any states where500 or more people are imp
acted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI. Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing tocomply with HIPAA standards. The Health Infor
mation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), enacted as part of ARRA,amended HIPAA to impose additional r
estrictions on third-party funded communications using PHI and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for PHI. TheHITECH Act also extended HIPAA privacy and security 
requirements and penalties directly to business associates. HHS has begun to audit health plans, providersand other parties to enfo
rce HIPAA compliance, including with respect to data security.In addition to HIPAA, state health pr
ivacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA, including laws that place strictercontrols on the release o
f information relating to specific diseases or conditions and requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or access toPHI. States also have adopted regul
ations to implement provisions of the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act(“GLBA”)) which generally requi
re insurers, including health insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health andfinancial informa
tion is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer23

Table of Contentsshares such information with 
a non-affiliated third party. Like HIPAA, GLBA sets a “floor” standard, allowing states to adopt more stringent requirementsgoverning privacy protect
ion. Complying with additional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the Company has made tocomply with HIPAA and GLBA.
The Cybersecurity Informa
tion Sharing Act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and, among other things,directs HHS to develop a set of volunt
ary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry. In addition, states have begun to enact morecomprehensive privacy l
aws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access, deletion, protection or transparency, such as the California ConsumerPrivacy Act (“CCPA”). States also are s
tarting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity, such as the regulations issued bythe New York Department of Financia
l Services. Complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations, which may differ from state to state, requires significantresources. In addition, dif
fering approaches to state privacy and/or cyber-security regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adverselyaffect the Company’s abilit
y to standardize its products and services across state lines. Widely-reported large scale commercial data breaches in the United Statesand abroad increase the 
likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states. These legislative and regulatory developmentswill impact the design and op
eration of the Company’s businesses, its privacy and security strategy and its web-based and mobile assets.Finally, each Public Exchange is 
required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to PII, and to impose privacy and security standards that are atleast as protective o
f PII as those the Public Exchange has implemented for itself or non-Public Exchange entities, which include insurers offering plans throughthe Public Exchange and their d
esignated downstream entities, including PBMs and other business associates. These standards may differ from, and be morestringent than, HIPAA.
Consumer Protection Laws
 - The federal governmen t has many consumer protection laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Postal ServiceAct and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Mos
t states also have similar consumer protection laws and a growing number of states regulate subscription programs.In addition, the federa
l government and most states have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring places of public accommodation, health care services and othergoods and services to be access
ible to people with disabilities. These consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis forinvestigations, lawsuits and mu
ltistate settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs, and health care products and services,pricing accuracy, expired fr
ont store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchangeprograms, disclosures rel
ated to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities. As a result of theCompany’s direct-to-consum
er activities, including mobile and web-based solutions offered to members and to other consumers, the Company also is subject tofederal and state r
egulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations. For example, the CCPAbecame effectiv
e in 2020, and additional federal and state regulation of consumer privacy protection may be proposed or enacted in 2020. The Company expectsthese new laws and regulations to 
impact the design of its products and services and the management and operation of its businesses and to increase its compliancecosts.
Transparency in Coverage Rule
 - In October 2020, the HHS, the U.S. Department of Labo r (“DOL”) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS,” and togetherwith the HHS and DOL, the “Tri-Departments”
) released a final rule requiring health insurers to disclose negotiated prices of drugs, medical services, supplies andother covered items. The 
rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose cost-sharing informationupon request, to a particip
ant, beneficiary, or enrollee and require plans and issuers to publicly disclose in-network provider rates, historical out-of-networkallowed amounts and the associ
ated billed charges, and negotiated rates and historical net prices for prescription drugs. Disclosure of data in a machine readablefile is required beginn
ing in January 2022, and insurers are required to have a consumer tool in place by January 2023. In August 2021, the federal governmentdelayed enforcement o
f the requirement to publish machine-readable files for in-network rates, out-of-network allowed amounts and billed charges until July 2022.It also delayed enforcement 
of machine-readable files related to prescription drug pricing until further rulemaking occurs. The public disclosure of insurer- orPBM-negotiated price concess
ions may result in drug manufacturers lowering discounts or rebates, resulting in higher drug costs for patients and impacting theability of the Company to negot
iate drug prices and provide competitive products and services to consumers.Additionally, the Consolidated Appropr
iations Act of 2021 was signed into law in December 2020 and contains further transparency provisions requiring grouphealth plans and health insu
rance issuers to report certain prescription drug costs, overall spending on health services and prescription drugs, and information aboutpremiums and the impac
t of rebates and other remuneration on premiums and out-of-pocket costs to the Tri-Departments. No later than 18 months after the firstsubmission and bi-annually the
reafter, the Tri-Departments will release a public report on drug pricing trends, drug reimbursement, and the24

Table of Contentsimpact of drug prices on pr
emiums. In August, the Tri-Departments deferred enforcement of both the December 2021 deadline for reporting 2020 plan year dataand the June 2022 deadline for r
eporting 2021 plan year data to December 2022.Telemarketing and Other Outbound Contacts
 - Certain federal and s tate laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Telemarketing SalesRule, give the FTC, the Federal Communic
ations Commission and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to,telemarketing pra
ctices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws provide consumerswith a private right of a
ction. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions.Pharmacy and Professional Licensure and Regulation
 - The Company is subject to a var iety of intersecting federal and state statutes and regulations that governthe wholesale distribution o
f drugs; operation of retail, specialty, infusion, LTC and mail order pharmacies; licensure of facilities and professionals, includingpharmacists, technic
ians, nurses and other health care professionals; registration of facilities with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) andanalogous state agencies 
that regulate controlled substances; packaging, storing, shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals; repackaging of drug products; labeling,medication guides and othe
r consumer disclosures; interactions with prescribers and health care professionals; compounding of prescription medications;dispensing of controlled and non-
controlled substances; counseling of patients; transfers of prescriptions; advertisement of prescription products and pharmacyservices; security; 
inventory control; recordkeeping; reporting to Boards of Pharmacy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the U.S. ConsumerProduct Safety Commission, the DEA and rel
ated state agencies; and other elements of pharmacy practice. Pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with awide variety of federa
l, state and local agencies with various powers to investigate, inspect, audit or solicit information, including Boards of Pharmacy andNursing, the DEA, the FDA, the DOJ, HHS and others. Many of these agencies hav
e broad enforcement powers, conduct audits on a regular basis, can imposesubstantial fines and 
penalties, and may revoke the license, registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional.State Insurance, HMO and Insurance Holding Company Regulation - 
A number of states regulat e affiliated groups of insurers and HMOs such as theCompany under holding company statut
es. These laws may, among other things, require prior regulatory approval of dividends and material intercompany transfersof assets and transactions b
etween the regulated companies and their affiliates, including their parent holding companies. The Company expects the states in whichits insurance and HMO subsidiaries 
are licensed to continue to expand their regulation of the corporate governance and internal control activities of its insurancecompanies and HMOs. Changes to state insur
ance, HMO and/or insurance holding company laws or regulations or changes to the interpretation of those laws orregulations, including due to 
regulators’ increasing concerns regarding insurance company and/or HMO solvency due, among other things, to past and expectedpayor insolvencies, could nega
tively affect the Company’s businesses in various ways, including through increases in solvency fund assessments, requirements thatthe Company hold greater lev
els of capital and/or delays in approving dividends from regulated subsidiaries.PBM offerings of prescription drug 
coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states. Such laws may require thatthe party at risk becom
e licensed as an insurer, establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability. Laws that may apply in such cases include insurancelaws and laws governing MCOs and limited pr
epaid health service plans. In addition, several states require that PBMs become directly registered or licensed withthe department of insur
ance or similar government oversight agency regardless of any arrangements they have with clients. PBM licensure laws may includeoversight of certain PBM act
ivities and operations and may include auditing of those activities.The states of domicile o
f the Company’s regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companiesand HMOs based on the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners’ (the “NAIC”) Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act (the “RBC Model Act”).These RBC requirements are int
ended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and HMOs, taking into account the risk characteristics of acompany’s investments and produ
cts. The RBC Model Act sets forth the formula for calculating RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account assetrisks, insurance risks, inte
rest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual company’s business. In general, under these laws, an insurancecompany or HMO must submit a report o
f its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year. AtDecember 31, 2021, the RBC level of each o
f the Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action.For information regarding 
restrictions on certain payments of dividends or other distributions by the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries, seeNote 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’
’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The holding company laws for the st
ates of domicile of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurancecompany or HMO without prior regulato
ry approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security ofan insurance holding company (su
ch as the25

Table of ContentsCompany’s ultimate paren
t company, CVS Health Corporation) that controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a resultof such transaction such person would 
control the insurance holding company. Control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause thedirection of the manag
ement and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the votingsecurities of another p
erson.Certain states have law
s that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company.These state laws vary, and viol
ation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.Government Agreements and Mandates
 - From time to time, th e Company and/or its various affiliates are subject to certain consent decrees, settlement andother agreements, corrective actio
n plans and corporate integrity agreements with various federal, state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacypractices, controll
ed substances, PDPs, expired products, environmental and safety matters, marketing and advertising practices, PBM, LTC and other pharmacyoperations and various other bus
iness practices. Certain of these agreements contain ongoing reporting, monitoring and/or other compliance requirements for theCompany. Failure t
o meet the Company’s obligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies, financial penalties, administrativeremedies, and/or exclusio
n from participation in federal health care programs.Environmental and Safety Regulation
 - The Company’s businesses are subje ct to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirementspertaining to protect
ion of the environment, public health and employee safety, including, for example, regulations governing the management of hazardoussubstances, the cleaning up of 
contaminated sites, and the maintenance of safe working conditions in the Company’s retail locations, distribution centers and otherfacilities. Governmental agencie
s at the federal, state and local levels continue to focus on the retail and health care sectors’ compliance with such laws andregulations, and have at t
imes pursued enforcement activities. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by governmentauthorities.
ERISA Regulation 
- The Employee Retiremen t Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employeepension and benefit plans, inc
luding private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide PBM services. Ingeneral, the Company assists pl
an sponsors in the administration of their health benefit plans, including the prescription drug benefit portion of those plans, inaccordance with the plan d
esigns adopted by the plan sponsors. In addition, the Company may have fiduciary duties where it has specifically contracted with a plansponsor to accept limit
ed fiduciary responsibility, such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims and/or the appeals of denied claims under aplan. In addition to its fidu
ciary provisions, ERISA imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certainforms of illegal re
muneration are made or received. These provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is oftenuncertain.
Some of the Company’s health and r
elated benefits and large case pensions products and services and related fees also are subject to potential issues raised byjudicial interpre
tations relating to ERISA. Under those interpretations, together with DOL regulations, the Company may have ERISA fiduciary duties with respectto PBM members and/or certa
in general account assets held under contracts that are not guaranteed benefit policies. As a result, certain transactions related to thosegeneral account assets 
are subject to conflict of interest and other restrictions, and the Company must provide certain disclosures to policyholders annually. TheCompany must comply with these res
trictions or face substantial penalties.In addition, ERISA generally pree
mpts all state and local laws that relate to employee benefit plans, but the extent of the pre-emption continues to be reviewed bycourts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. For ex
ample, in December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Arkansas law that, among other things, mandates aparticular pricing 
methodology, establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is below the pharmacy’s acquisition cost, permits apharmacy to reverse and 
rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than the reimbursement rate, prohibits a PBM fromreimbursing a pharmacy 
less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis, and permits a pharmacy to decline to dispense if the reimbursement islower than the pharmacy’s 
acquisition cost. Also, in November 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld a North Dakota law that regulatesemployer-sponsored ERISA health plans 
and certain PBM practices within Medicare.Other Legislative Initiativ
es and Regulatory Initiatives - The U.S. federal and state gove rnments, as well as governments in other countries where the Companydoes business, continue to enact 
and seriously consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that have had a material impact on or couldmaterially impa
ct various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and the Company’s businesses, operating results and/or cash flows. For example:26

Table of Contents•
Under the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 significant, automatic across-the-board budget cuts (known assequestration) began in Ma
rch 2013, including Medicare spending cuts of not more than 2% of total program costs per year through 2024. Since then,Congress has extended and modified s
equestration a number of times. The CARES Act temporarily suspended Medicare sequestration from May 2020 to theend of December 2020 and extended 
mandatory sequestration to 2030. Several subsequent acts have extended the temporary suspension of Medicaresequestration through the end o
f March 2022, at which point a 1% sequestration will take effect April 2022 through June 2022, with the full 2% sequestrationdue to resume in July 2022. Signific
ant uncertainty remains as to whether and how the U.S. Congress will proceed with actions that create additional federalrevenue and/or with e
ntitlement reform. The Company cannot predict future federal Medicare or federal or state Medicaid funding levels or the impact thatfuture federal or st
ate budget actions or entitlement program reform, if it occurs, will have on the Company’s businesses, operations or operating results, butthe effects could be m

Table of Contentsthe Company and other health pl
ans to expanded liability for punitive and other extra-contractual damages and additional state regulation.It is uncertain whether 
the Company can counter the potential adverse effects of such potential legislation or regulation on its operating results or cash flows,including whether it can r
ecoup, through higher premium rates, expanded membership or other measures, the increased costs of mandated coverage or benefits,assessments, fees, taxes or o
ther increased costs, including the cost of modifying its systems to implement any enacted legislation or regulations.The Company’s businesses also may be a
ffected by other legislation and regulations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act createsincentives for whistleblowe
rs to speak directly to the government rather than utilizing internal compliance programs and reduces the burden of proof under theForeign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 
(the “FCPA”). There also are laws and regulations that set standards for the escheatment of funds to states.Health savings accounts, heal
th reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending accounts and certain of the tax, fee and subsidy provisions of the ACA also areregulated by the U.S. Department o
f the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.The Company also may be adversely 
affected by court and regulatory decisions that expand or revise the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations orimpose medical malp
ractice or bad faith liability. Federal and state courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, continue to consider cases, and federal and stateregulators continue to issu
e regulations and interpretations, addressing bad faith liability for denial of medical claims, the scope of ERISA’s fiduciary dutyrequirements, the scope o
f the False Claims Act and the pre-emptive effect of ERISA and Medicare Part D on state laws.Contract Audits 
- The Company is subject to audits o f many of its contracts, including its PBM client contracts, its PBM rebate contracts, its PBM networkcontracts, its contra
cts relating to Medicare Advantage and/or Medicare Part D, the agreements the Company’s pharmacies enter into with other payors, itsMedicaid contracts and 
its customer contracts. Because some of the Company’s contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted withstate or federal agencies, au
dits of these contracts are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefitsprograms, including those which ope
rate Medicaid fee for service plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare Part D plans or Medicare Advantage organizations.Federal Employee Health Benefits Prog
ram - The Company’s subsidiaries cont ract with the Office of Personnel Management (the “OPM”) to provide managedhealth care servic
es under the FEHB program in their service areas. These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium ratingarrangements for this p
rogram. In addition to other requirements, such as the Transparency in Coverage Rule note above, OPM regulations require that community-rated FEHB plans meet a FEHB program-spec
ific minimum MLR by plan code and market. Managing to these rules is complicated by the simultaneousapplication of the min
imum MLR standards and associated premium rebate requirements of the ACA. The Company also has a contractual arrangement withcarriers for the FEHB program, su
ch as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to provide pharmacy services to federal employees, postal workers, annuitants, andtheir dependents under the Gove
rnment-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by the FEHB Act and as part of the FEHB program. Additionally, the Companymanages certain FEHB plans on a “cos
t-plus” basis. These arrangements subject the Company to certain aspects of the FEHB Act, and other federal regulations,such as the FEHB Acquisition Regulation, that o
therwise would not be applicable to the Company. The OPM also is auditing the Company and its other contractorsto, among other things, verify 
that plans meet their applicable FEHB program-specific MLR and the premiums established under the OPM’s Insured contracts andcosts allocated pursuant 
to the OPM’s cost-based contracts are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable FEHB program. The OPM may seek premiumrefunds or institute othe
r sanctions against the Company if it fails to comply with the FEHB program requirements.Clinical Services Regulation 
- The Company provides clinica l services to health plans, PBMs and providers for a variety of complex and common medicalconditions, includin
g arranging for certain members to participate in disease management programs. State laws regulate the practice of medicine, the practice ofpharmacy, the practi
ce of nursing and certain other clinical activities. Clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of clinicalservices must satisfy ap
plicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice.Third Party Administration and Other State Licensure Laws 
- Many states have licensu re or registration laws governing certain types of administrativeorganizations, such as PPOs, TPAs and companies tha
t provide utilization review services. Several states also have licensure or registration laws governing theorganizations that provid
e or administer consumer card programs (also known as cash card or discount card programs).28

ld. The Company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve customers in the European Economic Area following the UnitedKingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brex
it”).The Company’s international op
erations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely byjurisdiction, including an
ti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance,privacy, data protect
ion (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which began to apply across the EU during 2018), data mining, data transfer, laborand employment, intell
ectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; compulsory cessions ofreinsurance; required localization
 of records and funds; higher premium and income taxes; limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital; and requirements forlocal participat
ion in an insurer’s ownership. In addition, the expansion of the Company’s operations into foreign countries increases the Company’s exposure tothe anti-bribery, ant
i-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign laws, including the U.K.Bribery Act 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”).
Anti-Corruption Laws
 - The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain orretain business or otherwise s
ecure a business advantage. The Company also is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Inmany countries outside the Uni
ted States, health care professionals are employed by the government. Therefore, the Company’s dealings with them are subject toregulation under the FCPA. Violations of th
e FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, andthere continues to be a he
ightened level of FCPA enforcement activity by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the DOJ. The UKBribery Act is an anti-cor
ruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Disclosures ofFCPA violations may be shared with the UK authori
ties, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions.Anti-Money Laundering Regulations
 - Certain lines of the Company ’s businesses are subject to Treasury anti-money laundering regulations. Those lines ofbusiness have implemented 
anti-money laundering policies designed to ensure their compliance with the regulations. The Company also is subject to anti-moneylaundering laws in non-U.S. jurisdict
ions where it operates.Office of Foreign Assets Control
 - The Company also is subject to r egulation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury(“OFAC”). OFAC administers and enforces econom
ic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreigncountries and regimes, t
errorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and otherthreats to the nationa
l security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. In addition, the Company is subject to similar regulations in the non-U.S.jurisdictions in which it ope
rates.FDA Regulation - 
The FDA regulates the Company’s compounding pha rmacy and clinical research operations. The FDA also generally has authority to, amongother things, regulate th
e manufacture, distribution, sale and labeling of medical devices (including hemodialysis devices such as the device the Company isdeveloping and mobile medi
cal devices) and many products sold through retail pharmacies, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, cosmetics,dietary supplements and c
ertain food items. In addition, the FDA regulates the Company’s activities as a distributor of store brand products.Laws and Regulations Related to the Health Care Benefits Segment
In addition to the laws and regu
lations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state, localand international sta
tutes and regulations governing its Health Care Benefits segment specifically.Overview
 - Differing approaches to s tate insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability tostandardize its Health Ca
re Benefits products and services across state lines. These laws and regulations, including the ACA, restrict how the Company conducts itsbusiness and result in addition
al burdens and costs to the Company. Significant areas of governmental regulation include premium rates and rating methodologies,underwriting rules and procedu
res, required benefits, sales and marketing activities, provider rates of payment, restrictions on health plans’ ability to limitproviders’ participa
tion in their networks and/or remove providers from their networks and financial condition (including reserves and minimum capital or riskbased capital requir
ements). These laws and regulations are different in each jurisdiction and vary from product to product.29

Table of ContentsEach health insurer and HMO must f
ile periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs aresubject to state exam
ination and periodic license renewal. Applicable laws also restrict the ability of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends, andcertain dividends requi
re prior regulatory approval. In addition, some of the Company’s businesses and related activities may be subject to PPO, MCO, utilizationreview or TPA-related lic
ensure requirements and regulations. These licensure requirements and regulations differ from state to state, but may contain providernetwork, contracting, product 
and rate, financial and reporting requirements. There also are laws and regulations that set specific standards for the Company’sdelivery of services, pay
ment of claims, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, and payment for covered benefits and services.Required Regulatory Approvals
 - The Company must obtain and main tain regulatory approvals to price, market and administer many of its Health Care Benefitsproducts. Supervisory agencies, in
cluding CMS, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight and the DOL, as well as state health, insurance,managed care and Medic
aid agencies, have broad authority to take one or more of the following actions:•
Grant, suspend and revoke the Company’s licenses to transact business;•
Suspend or exclude the Company from participation in government programs;•
Suspend or limit the Company’s authority to market products;•
Regulate many aspects of the products and services the Company offers, including the pricing and underwriting of many of its products and services;•
Assess damages, fines and/or penalties;•
Terminate the Company’s contract with the government agency and/or withhold payments from the government agency to the Company;•
Impose retroactive adjustments to premiums and require the Company to pay refunds to the government, customers and/or members;•
Restrict the Company’s ability to conduct acquisitions or dispositions;•
Require the Company to maintain minimum capital levels in its subsidiaries and monitor its solvency and reserve adequacy;•
Regulate the Company’s investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria; and/or•
Exclude the Company’s plans from participating in Public Exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” premium rate increases or fail tomeet other criteria set by H
HS or the applicable state.The Company’s operations, curren
t and past business practices, current and past contracts, and accounts and other books and records are subject to routine, regularand special investigat
ions, audits, examinations and reviews by, and from time to time the Company receives subpoenas and other requests for information from,federal, state and international
 supervisory and enforcement agencies, attorneys general and other state, federal and international governmental authorities andlegislators.
Commercial Product Pricing and Underwriting Restri
ctions - Pricing and underwriting regu lation by states limits the Company’s underwriting and ratingpractices and those of oth
er health insurers, particularly for small employer groups, and varies by state. In general, these limitations apply to certain customersegments and limit the Comp
any’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups, or both, based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior claimexperience. In some sta
tes, these laws and regulations restrict the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs in theCompany’s pricing.
The ACA expanded the premium rate 
review process by, among other things, requiring the Company’s Commercial Insured rates to be reviewed for“reasonableness” at either the
 state or the federal level. HHS established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rateincreases equal to or ex
ceeding a federally (or lower state) specified threshold. HHS’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements aswell as additional revi
ew on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold. These combined state and federalreview requirements m
ay prevent, further delay or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes, which could adversely affect its MBRsand operating results,
 particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services and/or medical cost trend or when such utilization and/or trendexceeds the Company’s projec
tions.The ACA also specifies minimum MLRs of 85% 
for large group Commercial products and 80% for individual and small group Commercial products. Because theACA minimum MLRs are structured as “
floors” for many of their requirements, states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these restrictions.For Commercial products, sta
tes have and may adopt higher minimum MLR requirements, use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio,” incorporateminimum MLR
30

Table of Contentsrequirements into prospecti
ve premium rate filings, require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related to minimum MLR. MinimumMLR requirements and simil
ar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured Commercial products while leaving the Companyexposed to medical costs th
at are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to significant fines, penalties, premium refunds andlitigation if it f
ails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.In addition, the Company request
ed increases in its premium rates in its Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2022 and expects to continue to requestincreases in those rat
es for 2023 and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, andsignificant assessments, 
fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments, including as a result of the ACA. The Company’s rates also must be adequateto reflect adverse s
election in its products, particularly in small group Commercial products. These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks ofadverse publicity, advers
e regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the Company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied, reducedor delayed, which could lead to op
erating margin compression.Many of the laws and regulations gov
erning the Company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and othercarriers may charg
e between new and renewal business, and/or between groups based on differing characteristics. They may also require that carriers disclose tocustomers the basis o
n which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’ coverage.Recently, with respect to qua
lity improvement activities (“QIAs”) that health plans report to HHS, revised regulations no longer provide insurers the option ofreporting a flat amoun
t equal to 0.8 percent of earned premium in lieu of reporting the insurers' actual itemized QIA expenditures. This change will impact theCompany’s future MLR calculat
ions and reporting since we have utilized the 0.8 percent premium election.Medicaid Regulation - 
The Company is seeking to substantia lly grow its Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the nextseveral years. As a result, 
the Company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the various Medicaid,dual eligible and dual e
ligible special needs plan programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to the Company underthose programs.
Since 2017, Managed Medicaid produc
ts, including those the Company offers, are subject to a minimum federal MLR of 85%. A Medicaid managed care qualityrating system and provider n
etwork adequacy requirements also apply to Medicaid products. Because the federal minimum MLR is structured as a “floor,” stateshave the latitude to en
act more stringent rules governing these restrictions. For Managed Medicaid products, states may adopt higher minimum MLR requirements,use more stringent defin
itions of “medical loss ratio” or impose other requirements related to minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actionsfurther limit the 
level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured Medicaid products while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher thanthose reflected in i
ts pricing. The Company also may be subject to significant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimumMLR laws and regulations.
States continue to consider M
edicaid expansion; however, 12 states have still not decided to expand as of 2022. States may opt out of the elements of the ACArequiring expansion of Medic
aid coverage without losing their current federal Medicaid funding. In addition, the election of new governors and/or state legislaturesmay impact states’ p
revious decisions regarding Medicaid expansion. Although Congress enacted incentives for states that had not yet done so to expand Medicaid,this incentive alone m
ay not persuade holdout states to expand.In 2021, Medicaid MCOs faced new requir
ements and state flexibility that were finalized in the 2020 Medicaid managed care final rule. States now have flexibilityrelated to rate se
tting and provider network adequacy that could adversely or positively impact our Medicaid plans. Other changes related to managed careoperations include benef
iciary communications, appeals and grievances, and provider directories.The economic aspects of th
e Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan business vary from state to state and are subject to frequent change.Medicaid premiums ar
e paid by each state and differ from state to state. The federal government and certain states also are considering proposals and legislation forMedicaid and dual eligib
le program reforms or redesigns, including restrictions on the collection of manufacturer’s rebates on pharmaceuticals by Medicaid MCOsand their contracted PBMs, fur
ther program, population and/or geographic expansions of risk-based managed care, increasing beneficiary cost-sharing or paymentlevels, and changes to benef
its, reimbursement, eligibility criteria, provider network adequacy requirements (including requiring the inclusion of specified high costproviders in the Company’s networks) 
and program structure. In some states, current Medicaid and dual eligible funding and premium revenue may not beadequate for the Company to con
tinue31

Table of Contentsprogram participat
ion. The Company’s Medicaid and dual eligible contracts with states (or sponsors of Medicaid managed care plans) are subject to cancellation bythe state (or the sponsors of 
the managed care plans) after a short notice period without cause (e.g., when a state discontinues a managed care program) or in theevent of insufficient s
tate funding.The Company’s Medicaid, dual el
igible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by CMS and state Medicaid agencies, which havethe right to audit the Company
’s performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations. The Company’s Medicaid products, dual eligibleproducts and CHIP contracts also ar
e subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state Medicaid agencies regarding the services provided toMedicaid enrollees, pay
ment for those services, network requirements (including mandatory inclusion of specified high-cost providers), and other aspects of theseprograms, and by external r
eview organizations which audit Medicaid plans on behalf of state Medicaid agencies. The laws, regulations and contractualrequirements applic
able to the Company and other participants in Medicaid and dual eligible programs, including requirements that the Company submit encounterdata to the applicabl
e state agency, are extensive, complex and subject to change. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards,and its Medicaid and dual e
ligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources. CMS and/or state Medicaid agencies may fine theCompany, withhold payments to the Company, se
ek premium and other refunds, terminate the Company’s existing contracts, elect not to award the Company newcontracts or not to renew th
e Company’s existing contracts, prohibit the Company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in or refuse to automaticallyassign members to one or mor
e of the Company’s Medicaid or dual eligible products, exclude the Company from participating in one or more Medicaid or dualeligible programs and/o
r institute other sanctions and/or civil monetary penalties against the Company if it fails to comply with CMS or state regulations orcontractual requirements.
The Company cannot predict whethe
r pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the Medicaid program, norcan it predict the i
mpact those changes will have on its business operations or operating results, but the effects could be materially adverse.Federal and State Reporting 
- The Company is subject to extens ive financial and business reporting requirements, including penalties for inaccuracies and/oromissions, at both the feder
al and state level. The Company’s ability to comply with certain of these requirements depends on receipt of information from thirdparties that may not be 
readily available or reliably provided in all instances. The Company is and will continue to be required to modify its information systems,dedicate significan
t resources and incur significant expenses to comply with these requirements. However, the Company cannot eliminate the risks of unavailabilityof or errors in its repor
ts.Product Design and Administration and Sales Practices
 - State and/or federal reg ulatory scrutiny of health care benefit product design and administration andmarketing and advertis
ing practices, including the filing of insurance policy forms, the adequacy of provider networks, the accuracy of provider directories, and theadequacy of disclosure reg
arding products and their administration, is increasing as are the penalties being imposed for inappropriate practices. Medicare, Medicaidand dual eligible prod
ucts and products offering more limited benefits in particular continue to attract increased regulatory scrutiny.Guaranty Fund Assessments/Solvency Protection
 - Under guaranty fund laws existing in all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (inmost states up to prescrib
ed limits) for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guarantyassociations in which the Company pa
rticipates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers as well as health insurers. TheCompany’s assessments general
ly are based on a formula relating to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers.Certain states allow assess
ments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors suchas not-for-profit consum
er governed health plans established under the ACA. While historically the Company has ultimately recovered more than half of guarantyfund assessments through statuto
rily permitted premium tax offsets, significant increases in assessments could lead to legislative and/or regulatory actions that limitfuture offsets.
Laws and Regulations Related to the Pharmacy Services Segment
In addition to the laws and regu
lations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state andlocal statutes and regu
lations governing the operation of its Pharmacy Services segment specifically. Among these are the following:PBM Laws and Regulation 
- Legislation and/or regu lations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in anumber of states. This legis
lation could adversely affect the Company’s ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where thelegislation is in eff
ect and the Company’s ability to standardize32

Table of Contentsits PBM products and services across s
tate lines. In addition, certain quasi-regulatory organizations, including the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy andthe NAIC and the National Council of Insur
ance Legislators, have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBMactivities. Simila
rly, credentialing organizations such as URAC have established voluntary standards regarding PBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialtypharmacy activiti
es. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting organizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopttheir requirements or recommendati
ons and influence client requirements for PBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, anystandards established by thes
e organizations could also impact the Company’s health plan clients and/or the services provided to those clients and/or theCompany’s health plans.
The Company’s PBM activities also a
re regulated directly and indirectly at the federal and state levels, including being subject to the False Claims Act and statefalse claims acts 
and the AKS and state anti-kickback laws. These laws and regulations govern, and proposed legislation and regulations may govern and/or furtherrestrict, critical PBM practices
, including disclosure, receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers; use of,administration of and/o
r changes to drug formularies, maximum allowable cost (“MAC”) list pricing, average wholesale prices (“AWP”) and/or clinical programs;the offering to plan sponsors of p
ricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread” (i.e., a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsorby a PBM and the price paid by the PBM to the disp
ensing provider); reconciliation to pricing guarantees; disclosure of data to third parties; drug UM practices;the level of duty a PBM owes its custom
ers; configuration of pharmacy networks; the operations of the Company’s pharmacies (including audits of its pharmacies);disclosure of negotiated
 provider reimbursement rates; disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that areattributable to me
mbers’ drug utilization; and registration or licensing of PBMs. Failure by the Company or one of its PBM services suppliers to comply with theselaws or regulations could resu
lt in material fines and/or sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results and/or cash flows.The Company’s PBM service contracts, 
including those in which the Company assumes certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements, aregenerally not subject to 
insurance regulation by the states. However, state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of PBM activities due tolegislation passing in a numb
er of states requiring PBMs to register or obtain a license with the department, including through market conduct examinations andother audits our licensed 
entities. In addition, rulemaking is either underway or has already taken place in a number of states with the areas of focus on licensurerequirements, pharma
cy reimbursement for generics (MAC reimbursement) and pharmacy audits - most of which fall under the state insurance code.Most-Favored-Nation Rule
 - In November 2020, HHS released the Most-Favo red-Nation Rule (the “MFN Rule”), which requires CMS to take a most-favored-nation approach in calcu
lating payment for Medicare Part B drugs. The MFN Rule will test paying Part B drugs at comparable amounts to the lowest adjusted pricepaid by any country in the Organiz
ation for Economic Co-operation and Development that has a Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) per capita that is at least 60% ofthe U.S. GDP per capita. The MFN Rule will also test a 
redesign of the percentage add-on payment structure under Medicare Part B to remove incentives for use ofhigher-cost drugs through a fl
at per-dose add-on payment, and will include a financial hardship exemption for participants. The mandatory MFN Rule will operatefor seven years, from Janua
ry 1, 2021 to December 31, 2027. Over the course of the model, CMS will monitor and evaluate the impact of the MFN Rule onbeneficiary access 
to drugs, program costs, and the quality of care for beneficiaries. Further, CMS commits to assess initial impacts of the MFN Rule on quality ofcare, including access 
to drugs, prior to beginning performance year 5. Multiple pharmaceutical manufacturers have sued HHS over the rule, and it is currentlydelayed due to a tempora
ry restraining order prohibiting CMS from implementing it. If implemented, the MFN Rule may impact the ability of the Company tonegotiate drug prices and p
rovide competitive products and services to consumers. In August 2021, CMS published a proposed rule to rescind the MFN Rule. It isunclear whether this res
cission may be followed by regulatory or legislative alternatives that present similar, or even more substantial, patient access, providerreimbursement, and othe
r concerns.Pharmacy Network Access Legislation 
- Medicare Part D and a ma jority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s (and its healthplans’ and its health plan 
clients’) ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove pharmacy network providers. For example, certain “any willingprovider” legislation 
may require the Company or its clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price andother applicable te
rms and conditions for network participation. These laws could negatively affect the services and economic benefits achievable through a limitedpharmacy provider network. Also, a 
majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s ability (and the Company’s and its client healthplans’ ability) to conduc
t audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to the Company for payment. These laws could negatively affect theCompany’s ability to recove
r overpayments of claims submitted by network pharmacies that the Company identifies through pharmacy audits.33

Table of ContentsFinally, several states h
ave passed legislation that limits the ability of PBMs and health insurers to provide special benefit structures for use with affiliatedpharmacies, which could resu
lt in reduced savings to clients and consumers.Pharmacy Pricing Legislation
 - A number of states have passed legislation regulating the Company’s ability to manage and establish MACs for genericprescription drugs. MAC methodology is a 
common cost management practice used by private and public payors (including CMS) to pay pharmacies fordispensing generic prescr
iption drugs. MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that isavailable from mul
tiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies, thekinds of drugs that a PBM can pay for at 
a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could negativelyaffect the Company’s abi
lity to establish MAC prices for generic drugs. Additionally, some states have passed legislation that would create a reimbursementbenchmark mandate, such as 
the national average drug acquisition cost and/or the wholesale acquisition cost (“WAC”), plus a set dispensing fee, for pharmacies inthe network.
Formulary and Plan Design Regulation 
- A number of government enti ties regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. HHS regulates howMedicare Part D formula
ries are developed and administered, including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories, subject to limitedexceptions. Under the ACA, CMS imposes drug coverage 
requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits, including plans offered throughfederal or state Publi
c Exchanges. Additionally, the NAIC and health care accreditation agencies like NCQA and URAC have developed model acts and standardsfor formulary developm
ent that are often incorporated into government requirements. Many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as thedelivery channels to re
ceive prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. The increasing government regulation of formularies couldsignificantly affe
ct the Company’s ability to develop and administer formularies, pharmacy networks and other plan design features. Similarly, some states prohibithealth plan sponsor
s from implementing certain restrictive pharmacy benefit plan design features. This regulation could limit or preclude (i) limited networks, (ii) arequirement to use particular 
providers, (iii) copayment differentials among providers and (iv) formulary tiering practices.Laws and Regulations Related to the Retail/LTC Segment
In addition to the laws and regu
lations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state andlocal statutes and regu
lations governing the operation of its Retail/LTC segment specifically. Among these are the following:Retail Medical Clinics 
- States regulate re tail medical clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight, clinic and lablicensure requirem
ents and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine. A number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impactcertain components of r
etail medical clinic operations such as physician oversight, signage, third party contracting requirements, bathroom facilities, and scope ofservices. These laws and regul
ations may affect the operation and expansion of the Company’s owned and managed retail medical clinics.Other Laws - 
Other federal, state and local laws and regulations also impact the Company’s retail operations, including laws and regulations governing thepractice of optomet
ry, the practice of audiology, the provision of dietician services and the sale of durable medical equipment, contact lenses, eyeglasses, hearingaids and alcohol.

The spread of, impact of and response to COVID-19 underscores and amplifies c
ertain risks we face. The impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses,operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncerta
in, but the impact could be material and adverse.COVID-19 has spread to every state in th
e U.S., has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has severely impacted, and is expected tocontinue to severely imp
act, the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world.The legislative and regu
latory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and changing frequently, including the Families First Act, the CARES Act, theAmerican Rescue Plan Act and mand
ated increases to the medical services we must pay for without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in ourHealth Care Benefits Insured p
roducts. As a result of COVID-19, including legislative and/or regulatory responses to COVID-19, the premiums we charge in ourInsured Health Care Benefits p
roducts may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of medical services delivered to our Insured medical members, which mayincrease significantly as a re
sult of higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs.Federal, state and loca
l governmental policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including existing and new variants, such as mask andvaccination mandates, 
restrictions on large gatherings and social distancing directives, may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19pandemic and have resulte
d in, among other things, a reduction in utilization that is discretionary, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, reducedcustomer traffic 
and front store sales in our retail pharmacies, our customers being ordered to close or severely curtail their operations, the adoption of work-from-home policies and a reduc
tion in diagnostic reporting due to reductions in health care provider visits and restrictions on our access to providers’ medical records, allof which impact our businesses. Among oth
er impacts of these policies and initiatives on our businesses, there may be changes in medical claims submissionpatterns and an adverse i
mpact on (i) drug utilization due to the reduction in discretionary visits with providers; (ii) front store sales as a result of reduced customertraffic in our ret
ail pharmacies; (iii) medical membership in our Health Care Benefits segment and covered lives in our PBM clients due to reductions in workforceat our existing customers 
(including due to business failures) as well as reduced willingness to change benefits providers by prospective customers; (iv) benefitcosts due to COVID-19 related support progr
ams we have put in place for our medical members and mandated increases to the medical services we must pay forwithout a corresponding incre
ase in the premiums we receive in our Insured Health Care Benefits products; and (v) the amount, timing and collectability ofpayments to the Company from cus
tomers, clients, government payers and members as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on them. Over time, these policies andinitiatives also may 
cause us to experience increased benefit costs and/or decreased revenues in our Health Care Benefits segment if, as a result of our medicalmembers not seeing thei
r providers as a result of COVID-19, we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to manage benefit costs and chronic conditions of ourmedical members and 
appropriately document their risk profiles.In addition, in response to COVID-19, during the 
first half of 2020, we began to offer our medical members expanded benefit coverage and became obligated bygovernmental action to p
rovide other additional coverage. This expanded benefit coverage continued to be provided without a corresponding increase in thepremiums we receive in ou
r Insured Health Care Benefits37

products. We also are taking actions designed to help provide financial and administrative relief for the health care provider community. Such measures and anyfurther steps we take or a
re required to take to expand or otherwise modify the services delivered to our Health Care Benefits members, provide relief for the healthcare provider communi
ty, or in connection with the relaxation of social distancing directives and other restrictions on movement and economic activity intended toreduce the spread of COVID-19, including 
the potential for widespread testing and vaccination, including boosters, as a component of lifting those measures, couldadversely impact our ben
efit costs, MBR and operating results.The various initiatives we h
ave implemented to slow and/or reduce the impact of COVID-19 and the COVID-19-related support programs we have put in place forour customers, medical 
members and colleagues have increased our operating expenses and reduced the efficiency of our operations. Our operating results willcontinue to be adversely a
ffected so long as these initiatives continue or if they are expanded. In addition, any adverse economic conditions that could be caused byCOVID-19 may have an adverse impact on ou
r net investment income and the value of our investment portfolio.The spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to 
mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively,including as a result 
of the complete or partial closure of facilities, labor shortages and/or financial difficulties experienced by third-party service providers.Disruptions in our supply chains, our dist
ribution chains and/or public and private infrastructure, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, materialavailability, global 
logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers, and labor availabilityconstraints, could mate
rially and adversely impact our business operations. We have transitioned a significant subset of our colleagues to a remote workenvironment in an effor
t to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as have a significant number of our third-party service providers, which may amplify certain risks toour businesses, including an incr
eased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, increased risk ofunauthorized disseminat
ion of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our medical members or other third-parties andincreased risk of business in
terruptions.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve 
and the severity and duration of the pandemic and scope and intensity of the governmental response to it areunknown at this time. We beli
eve COVID-19’s impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by thegeographies impacted and 
the severity and duration of the pandemic; vaccination rates; the severity of any new COVID-19 variants and whether vaccines areeffective in comba
ting them; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing,scope and impact of any addi
tional stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers arebeyond our knowledge and control. As a resul
t, the impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition isuncertain, but the impa
ct could be adverse and material. COVID-19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against us.Risks Relating to Our Businesses
We may not be able to accurately 
forecast health care and other benefit costs, which could adversely affect our Health Care Benefits segment’s operatingresults. There can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits 
costs will not exceed our projections.As a result of COVID-19, the current econo
mic environment is adverse and less predictable than recently experienced, which has caused and may continue to causeunanticipated and signif
icant volatility in our health care and other benefits costs, including COVID-19 related testing and vaccination and post-acute care skillednursing facility and behav
ioral health costs. In January 2021, the President of the United States issued an executive order to support government efforts to expandaccess, availabili
ty and use of COVID-19 diagnostic, screening and surveillance and addressed the cost of COVID-19 testing by facilitating COVID-19 testing freeof charge to those who lack comp
rehensive health insurance and clarifying group health plans’ and health insurance issuers’ obligations to provide coverage forCOVID-19 testing. In January 2022, the HHS announced that co
mmercial health insurers must cover the cost of up to eight rapid COVID-19 OTC test kits perindividual per 30-day period. 
In addition, the timing of vaccine administration to the general public and related costs as well as the identification of new, moreinfectious strains of th
e COVID-19 virus and whether the vaccines will be effective against such new strains are uncertain and may impact our MBR. Premiums forour Insured Health Care Benefi
ts products, which comprised 93% of our Health Care Benefits revenues for 2021, are priced in advance based on our forecasts ofhealth care and other b
enefit costs during a fixed premium period, which is generally twelve months. These forecasts are typically developed several months beforethe fixed premium period 
begins, are influenced by historical data (and recent historical data in particular), are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detectmedical cost trends and c
hanges in our members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns and medical claim submission patterns and require a significantdegree of judgment. For examp
le, our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June of the year before the contract year. Cost increases in excessof
38

our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of ourforecasts of the incr
eases in health care and other benefit costs that we expect to occur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. For 2022, thoseforecasts include adjus
tments made to pricing based on prospective expectations for liabilities due to testing, vaccines, direct COVID-19 treatment and deferredcare. Risk-adjusted revenu
e has been adjusted for deferred care, and forecasted enrollment considers assumptions about the economic environment, thoughCOVID-19 related impacts rem
ain uncertain. During periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical costs trends experience significantvolatility and medic
al claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19, accurately detecting, forecasting, managing, reserving and pricingfor our (and our self-insur
ed customers’) medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging. There can be noassurance regarding the 
accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing, and our health care and other benefit costs (includingCOVID-19 related testing and vacc
ination and post-acute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs) are affected by COVID-19 and other externalevents over which we have no control. Ev
en relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage ofpremium revenues can r
esult in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment’s operating results.A number of factors contribu
te to rising health care and other benefit costs, including COVID-19, previously uninsured members entering the health care system,changes in members’ beha
vior and health care utilization patterns, turnover in our membership, additional government mandated benefits or other regulatorychanges (including under the Fa
milies First Act, the CARES Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act), changes in the health status of our members, the aging of thepopulation and other changing de
mographic characteristics, advances in medical technology, increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs (includingspecialty pharmacy drugs 
and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies), direct-to-consumer marketing by drug manufacturers, the increasing influence of social mediaon our members’ health c
are utilization and other behaviors, changes in health care practices and general economic conditions (such as inflation and employmentlevels). In addition, govern
ment-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector tobear a greater shar
e of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population mayamplify this problem. Othe
r factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include epidemics or other pandemics, changes as a result of the ACA,changes to the ACA and other changes in th
e regulatory environment, the evolution toward a consumer driven business model, new technologies, influenza-relatedhealth care costs (which 
may be substantial and higher than we expected), clusters of high-cost cases, health care provider and member fraud, and numerous otherfactors that are or 
may be beyond our control. For example, the 2020-2021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19; andthe 2019-2020 influenza season had 
an earlier than average start and had a higher incidence of influenza than the 2018-2019 influenza season.Our Health Care Benefits segmen
t’s operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and otherbenefit costs through underwri
ting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical managementprograms. Our medical cost 
management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect. Thefactors described above ma
y adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our competitivenessand operating results.
Furthermore, if we are 
not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reportedclaims or reported claims that 
have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit costexperience in our pric
ing process may be limited, which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These risks areparticularly acute during peri
ods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical cost trends experience significant volatility and medical claimsubmission patterns are ch
anging rapidly as a result of COVID-19. Such risks are further magnified by the ACA and other existing and future legislation andregulations that limit our a
bility to price for our projected and/or experienced increases in utilization and/or medical cost trends.There can be no assurance th
at future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.Adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad can materiall
y and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition,and we do not expect these conditions to improve 
in the near future.Adverse economic conditions in 
the U.S. and abroad, including those caused by COVID-19, can materially and adversely impact our businesses, operating results,cash flows and financial cond
ition, including:39

•In our Pharmacy Services segment, by causing drug utilization to decline, reducing demand for PBM services and adversely affecting the financial health ofour PBM clients.
•
In our Retail/LTC segment, by causing drug utilization to decline, changing consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns leading toreduced consumer demand fo
r products sold in our stores and adversely affecting the financial health of our LTC pharmacy customers.•
By causing our existing customers to reduce workforces (including due to business failures), which would reduce our revenues, the number of covered lives inour PBM clients and/or the number o
f members our Health Care Benefits segment serves.•
By causing our clients and customers and potential clients and customers, particularly those with the most employees or members, and state and localgovernments, to force us to co
mpete more vigorously on factors such as price and service, including service, discount and other performance guarantees, toretain or obtain thei
r business.•
By causing customers and potential customers of our Health Care Benefits and Retail/LTC segments to purchase fewer products and/or products that generateless profit for us than the on
es they currently purchase or otherwise would have purchased.•
By causing customers and potential customers of our Health Care Benefits segment, particularly smaller employers and individuals, to forego obtaining orrenewing their health and o
ther coverage with us.•
In our Health Care Benefits segment, by causing unanticipated increases and volatility in utilization of medical and other covered services, including COVID-19 related testing, vaccinati
on and behavioral health services, by our medical members, changes in medical claim submission patterns and/or increases inmedical unit costs and/o
r provider behavior, each of which would increase our costs and limit our ability to accurately detect, forecast, manage, reserve andprice for our (and our
 self-insured customers’) medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs.•
By increasing medical unit costs and causing changes in provider behavior in our Health Care Benefits segment as hospitals and other providers attempt tomaintain revenue lev
els in their efforts to adjust to their own COVID-19-related and other economic challenges.•
By weakening the ability or perceived ability of the issuers and/or guarantors of the debt or other securities we hold in our investment portfolio to perform ontheir obligations to us, which cou
ld result in defaults in those securities and has reduced, and may further reduce, the value of those securities and has created,and may continue to crea
te, net realized capital losses for us that reduce our operating results.•
By weakening the ability of our customers, including self-insured customers in our Health Care Benefits segment, medical providers and the other companieswith which we do business as well as our medi
cal members to perform their obligations to us or causing them not to perform those obligations, either of whichcould reduce our operating 
results.•
By weakening the ability of our former subsidiaries and/or their purchasers to satisfy their lease obligations that we have guaranteed and causing the Companyto be required to satisfy 
those obligations.•
By weakening the financial condition of other insurers, including long-term care insurers and life insurers, which increases the risk that we will receivesignificant assessments 
for obligations of insolvent insurers to policyholders and claimants.•
By causing, over time, inflation that could cause interest rates to increase and thereby increase our interest expense and reduce our operating results, as well asdecrease the value of 
the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio, which would reduce our operating results and/or adversely affect our financialcondition.
Furthermore, reductions in work
force by our customers can cause unanticipated increases in the health care and other benefits costs of our Health Care Benefitssegment. For example, our business 
associated with members who have elected to receive benefits under Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (knownas “COBRA”) typically has an MBR that is signif
icantly higher than our overall Commercial MBR.Each of our segments operates in a highly competit
ive and evolving business environment; and operating income in the industries in which we compete maydecline.
Each of our segments, Health Car
e Benefits, Pharmacy Services, which includes our PBM business, and Retail/LTC, operates in a highly competitive and evolvingbusiness environment. Specifi
cally:•
As competition increases in the geographies in which we operate, including competition from new entrants, a significant increase in price compression and/orreimbursement pressur
es could occur, and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive.•
In our Health Care Benefits segment we are seeking to substantially grow our Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan membership over thenext several years. In m
any instances, to acquire and retain our government40

customers’ business, we must bid against our competitors in a highly competitive environment. Winning bids often are challenged successfully byunsuccessful bidders, and may a
lso be withdrawn or cancelled by the issuing agency.•
Customer contracts in our Health Care Benefits segment are generally for a period of one year, and our customers have considerable flexibility in movingbetween us and our competitors. One o
f the key factors on which we compete for customers, especially in uncertain economic environments, is overall cost.We are therefore under press
ure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing health care and other benefit costs and increasingoperating costs. If 
we are unable to increase our prices to reflect, or otherwise mitigate the impact of, increasing costs, our profitability will be adverselyaffected. If we are unable t
o limit our price increases, we may lose members to competitors with more favorable pricing, adversely affecting our revenues andoperating results. In respons
e to rising prices, our customers may elect to self-insure or to reduce benefits in order to limit increases in their benefit costs.Alternatively, our custom
ers may purchase different types of products from us that are less profitable. Such elections may result in reduced membership in ourmore profitable Insur
ed products and/or lower premiums for our Insured products, which may adversely affect our revenues and operating results, althoughsuch elections also may r
educe our health care and other benefit costs. In addition, our Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP products are subject to terminationwithout cause, periodic re
-bid, rate adjustment and program redesign, as customers seek to contain their benefit costs, particularly in an uncertain economy,and our exposure to this risk is in
creasing as we grow our Government products membership. These actions may adversely affect our membership, revenuesand operating results.
•
We requested increases in our premium rates in our Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2021 and expect to request increases in those rates for 2022and beyond in order to adequate
ly price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significant assessments, feesand taxes imposed by federa
l and state governments, including as a result of the ACA. Our rates also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our products willbe selected by people with a h
igher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established pricing for the applicableproducts (also known as “adverse se
lection”), particularly in small group Commercial products. These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten therisks of adverse publicity, 
adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied, reducedor delayed, which could lead to op
erating margin compression.•
The competitive success of our Pharmacy Services segment is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with networkpharmacies as PBM clients ev
aluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks.•
The competitive success of our Retail/LTC segment and our specialty pharmacy operations is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractualrelationships with PBMs and other payors on 
acceptable terms as the payors’ clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks.•
In our PBM business, we maintain contractual relationships with brand name drug manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugsdispensed by pharmacies in our 
retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients).Manufacturer’s reba
tes often depend on a PBM’s ability to meet contractual requirements, including the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the PBM’sformularies. If we lose ou
r relationship with one or more drug manufacturers, or if the discounts or rebates provided by drug manufacturers decline, ouroperating results, cash f
lows and/or prospects could be adversely affected.•
The PBM industry has been experiencing price compression as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices, increasedrevenue sharing, inclu
ding sharing in a larger portion of rebates received from drug manufacturers, enhanced service offerings and/or higher service levels.Marketplace dynamics 
and regulatory changes also have adversely affected our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail“differential” o
r “spread,” which could adversely affect our future profitability, and we expect these trends to continue.•
Our retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and LTC pharmacy operations have been affected by reimbursement pressure caused by competition, including clientdemands for lower prices, gen
eric drug pricing, earlier than expected generic drug introductions and network reimbursement pressure. If we are unable toincrease our prices to reflect,
 or otherwise mitigate the impact of, increasing costs, our profitability will be adversely affected. If we are unable to limit ourprice increases, we may 
lose customers to competitors with more favorable pricing, adversely affecting our revenues and operating results.•
A shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates as a result of competition or otherwise couldadversely affect our 
margins, including the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day prescriptions at retail and the ongoing shift in pharmacy mixtowards Medicare Part D presc
riptions.•
PBM client contracts often are for a period of approximately three years. However, PBM clients may require early or periodic re-negotiation of pricing prior tocontract expiration. PBM cl
ients are generally well informed, can move between us and our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration oftheir contracts. We 
are therefore under pressure to contain price increases despite being faced with increasing drug costs and increasing operating costs. If weare unable to increase our
 prices to reflect, or otherwise mitigate the impact of, increasing costs, our profitability will be adversely41

affected. If we are unable to limit our price increases, we may lose customers to competitors with more favorable pricing, adversely affecting our revenues andoperating results.
•
The operating results and margins of our LTC business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitatedpricing arrangements 
and by the financial health of, and purchases and sales of, our LTC customers.In addition, competitors 
in each of our businesses may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer. Competition also may comefrom new entrants and other sou
rces in the future. Unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings in therapidly changing health c
are industry, we may be unable to remain competitive.Disruptive innovation by existing o
r new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess suchalterations and make 
timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. For example, decisions to buy our Health CareBenefits and Pharmacy Servic
es products and services increasingly are made or influenced by consumers, either through direct purchasing (e.g., MedicareAdvantage plans and PDPs) or through Public Exchanges 
and private health insurance exchanges that allow individual choice. Consumers also are increasinglyseeking to access consumer goods 
and health care products and services locally and through other direct channels such as mobile devices and websites. To competeeffectively in the consumer-dri
ven marketplace, we will be required to develop or acquire new capabilities, attract new talent and develop new service anddistribution relationsh
ips that respond to consumer needs and preferences.Changes in marketplace dyna
mics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation, the emergence of new competitors and strategicalliances, and decisions 
to exclude us from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks could materially and adversely affect our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows and/or prospe
cts.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to comp
ete successfully on Public Exchanges or that our pricing or other actions will result in theprofitability of our Public Exchange products.
In January 2022, we entered into th
e Public Exchanges in eight states. To compete effectively on Public Exchanges, we have developed or acquired the technology,systems, tools and talent ne
cessary to interact with Public Exchanges and engage Public Exchange consumers through enhanced consumer-focused sales, marketingchannels and customer int
erfaces. We have also created new customer service programs and product offerings. While participating on the Public Exchanges, wewill have to respond to pricing 
and other actions taken by existing competitors and regulators as well as potentially disruptive new entrants, which could reduce ourprofit margins. Due to the pr
ice transparency provided by Public Exchanges, when we market products we face competitive pressures from existing and newcompetitors who may have lower 
cost structures. Our competitors may bring their Public Exchange and other consumer products to market more quickly, havegreater experienc
e marketing to consumers and/or may be targeting the higher margin portions of our business. We can provide no assurance that we will be able tocompete successfully or p
rofitably on Public Exchanges or that we will be able to benefit from any opportunities presented by Public Exchanges.In addition, there can be no 
assurance that our pricing or other actions will result in the profitability of our Public Exchange products in 2022 or any future year.We have set 2022 premium r
ates for our Public Exchange products based on our projections, including as to the health status and quantity of membership andutilization of medical and/or 
other covered services by members. The accuracy of the projections reflected in our pricing may be impacted by (i) adverse selectionamong individuals who require or u
tilize more expensive medical and/or other covered services, (ii) other plans’ withdrawals from participation in the PublicExchanges we serve and (iii) 
legislation, regulations, enforcement activity and/or judicial decisions that cause Public Exchanges to operate in a manner differentthan what we projected in set
ting our premium rates.A change in our Health Care Benefits product mix may adverse
ly affect our profit margins.Our Insured Health Care Benefits p
roducts that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our ASC products. Historically, smalleremployer groups have been mor
e likely to purchase Insured Health Care Benefits products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to beargreater liabili
ty for health care expenditures, although over the last several years even relatively small employers have moved to ASC products. We also serve, andexpect to grow our business with, governm
ent-sponsored programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, that are subject to competitive bids and have lower profitmargins than our Commerci
al Insured Health Care Benefits products. A shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have amaterial adverse effect on the 
Health Care Benefits segment’s operating results.42

Negative public perception of the industries in which we operate, or of our industries’ or our practices, can adversely affect our businesses, operating results,cash flows and prospects.
Our brand and reputation are 
two of our most important assets, and the industries in which we operate have been and are negatively perceived by the public fromtime to time. Negativ
e publicity may come as a result of adverse media coverage, litigation against us and other industry participants, the ongoing public debatesover drug pricing, PBMs, government involv
ement in drug pricing and purchasing, changes to the ACA, “surprise” medical bills, governmental hearings and/orinvestigations, actual o
r perceived shortfalls regarding our industries’ or our own products and/or business practices (including PBM operations, drug pricing andinsurance coverage determinatio
ns) and social media and other media relations activities. Negative publicity also may come from a failure to meet customerexpectations for consist
ent, high quality and accessible care. This risk may increase as we continue to offer products and services that make greater use of data andas our business model becomes mo
re focused on delivering health care to consumers.In addition, by working with the U.S. government 
in the distribution and administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Company may be subject to negativepublicity related to 
the government’s actions in response to COVID-19 that are outside of the ability of the Company to control.Negative public percept
ion and/or publicity of our industries in general, or of us or our key vendors, brokers or product distribution networks in particular, canfurther increase our 
costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results and our stock price by:•
adversely affecting our brand and reputation;•
adversely affecting our ability to market and sell our products and/or services and/or retain our existing customers and members;•
requiring us to change our products and/or services;•
reducing or restricting the revenue we can receive for our products and/or services; and/or•
increasing or significantly changing the regulatory and legislative requirements with which we must comply.We must maintain and improve our relationships with our retail and spe
cialty pharmacy customers and increase the demand for our products and services,including proprietary brands.
The success of our businesses depends in p
art on customer loyalty, superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores andonline sites and to purchase p
roducts in additional categories and our proprietary brands. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumerpreferences and spending pa
tterns, and evolving demographic mixes in the communities we serve, an inability to expand the products being purchased by ourclients and customers, or 
the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could adversely affect our relationship with our customers andclients and the demand fo
r our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products.We offer our retai
l customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites. The sale of proprietaryproducts subjects us to unique risks 
including potential product liability risks, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, potential supply chain and distribution chaindisruptions for raw mater
ials and finished products, our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties, andother risks generally en
countered by entities that source, market and sell private-label products. We also face similar risks for the other products we sell in our retailoperations, including supply cha
in and distribution chain disruption risk. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effecton our retail business, opera
ting results, cash flows and/or financial condition. Additionally, an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may adversely affectour sales of products owned by our supplie
rs and adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stablesuppliers who satisfy our requir
ements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, thatcustomer confidence is no
t diminished. Any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our operatingresults and erode custome
r loyalty.We also could be adversely 
affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in marketplace dynamics. For example, specialty pharmacy represents asignificant and growing proport
ion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies.Because our specialty phar
macy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited numberof pharmacies (so-called limited 
distribution drugs) that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of our43

specialty pharmacy business depends largely upon expanding our access to key drugs and penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our baseof patients or reduction 
in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business, operating resultsand cash flows.
We face risks relating to the avai
lability, pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell.The profitability of our Re
tail/LTC and Pharmacy Services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. We dispense significantvolumes of brand name and gene
ric drugs from our retail, LTC, specialty and mail order pharmacies, and the retail pharmacies in our PBM’s network also dispensesignificant volumes of br
and name and generic drugs. Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions fordrugs or the utilization o
f drugs is reduced, including due to:•
increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions;•
manufacturing or other supply issues;•
a reduction in drug manufacturers’ participation in federal programs;•
certain products being withdrawn by their manufacturers or transitioned to over-the-counter products;•
future FDA rulings restricting the supply or increasing the cost of products;•
the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs or lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products; or•
inflation in the price of drugs.In addition, increased ut
ilization of generic drugs (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs) has resulted in pressure todecrease reimburse
ment payments to retail, mail order, specialty and LTC pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in our margins on sales of genericdrugs. Consolidation within the gener
ic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increasepricing of generic drugs and d
iminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased brand name or genericprescription drug acquisi
tion costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on ouroperating results.
The reserves we hold for expected cla
ims in our Insured Health Care Benefits products are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgmentand are inherently variable. Any reserve, including a pre
mium deficiency reserve, may be insufficient. If actual claims exceed our estimates, our operatingresults could be materially adv
ersely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.A large portion of health c
are claims are not submitted to us until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to our members. Ourreported health care costs 
payable for any particular period reflect our estimates of the ultimate cost of such claims as well as claims that have been reported to usbut not yet paid. We also must 
estimate the amount of rebates payable under the MLR rules of the ACA, CMS and the OPM and the amounts payable by us to, andreceivable by us from, th
e United States federal government under the ACA’s remaining premium stabilization program.Our estimates of health 
care costs payable are based on a number of factors, including those derived from historical claim experience, but this estimation processalso makes use of extensive 
judgment. Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes inmedical claims subm
ission and processing patterns and/or procedures, turnover and other changes in membership, changes in product mix, changes in theutilization of medical and/or 
other covered services, including prescription drugs, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our medical management practicesand the introduction of new bene
fits and products. We estimate health care costs payable periodically, and any resulting adjustments, including premium deficiencyreserves, are refl
ected in current-period operating results within benefit costs. For example, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we established a premiumdeficiency reserve o
f $16 million and $11 million, respectively, related to Medicaid products in the Health Care Benefits segment. A worsening (or improvement)of health care cost t
rend rates or changes in claim payment patterns from those that we assumed in estimating health care costs payable as of December 31, 2021would cause these estimat
es to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.Furthermore, if we are 
not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reportedclaims or reported claims that 
have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit costexperience in our pric
ing process may be limited, which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These risks areparticularly acut
e during and following periods when utilization of medical and/or other covered services and/or medical cost trends are below44

recent historical levels and in products where there is significant turnover in our membership each year, and such risks are further magnified by the ACA and otherlegislation and regulation
s that limit our ability to price for our projected and/or experienced increases in utilization and/or medical cost trends.Our operating results are affected by the heal
th of the economy in general and in the geographies we serve.Our businesses are affect
ed by the U.S. economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geographies we serve, including various economic factors,including inflation and ch
anges in consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns. An unfavorable, uncertain or volatile economic environmentcould cause a decline in d
rug utilization, an increase in health care utilization and dampen demand for PBM services as well as consumer demand for products soldin our retail stores.
If our customers’ operatin
g and financial performance deteriorates, or they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain adequate financing, our customersmay not be able to pay tim
ely, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us. Any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services may adverselyaffect our businesses, oper
ating results and cash flows. In addition, both state and federal government sponsored payers, as a result of budget deficits or spendingreductions, may suspend payments o
r seek to reduce their health care expenditures resulting in our customers delaying payments to us or renegotiating theircontracts with us.
Further, economic conditions 
including interest rate fluctuations, changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtainnecessary financing on
 acceptable terms, our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms, our ability to execute sale-leaseback transactionsunder acceptable te
rms and the value of our investment portfolio. Adverse changes in the U.S. economy, consumer confidence and economic conditions could havean adverse effect on our bus
inesses and financial results. This adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible healthplans and health plan designs f
avoring co-insurance over co-payments as members and other consumers may decide to postpone, or not to seek, medical treatmentwhich may lead them to incu
r more expensive medical treatment in the future and/or decrease our prescription volumes.In addition, our Health Care Bene
fits membership remains concentrated in certain U.S. geographies and in certain industries. Unfavorable changes in health care orother benefit costs or reim
bursement rates or increased competition in those geographic areas where our membership is concentrated could therefore have adisproportionately advers
e effect on our Health Care Benefits segment’s operating results. Our Health Care Benefits membership has been and may continue to beaffected by workforce r
eductions by our customers due to adverse and/or uncertain general economic conditions, especially in the U.S. geographies and industrieswhere our membership is conc
entrated. As a result, we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our Health Care Benefits membership geographically, byproduct type or by customer indus
try, and our revenues and operating results may be disproportionately affected by adverse changes affecting our customers.We are exposed to risks relating to the sol
vency of other insurers.We are subject to assess
ments under guaranty fund laws existing in all states for obligations of insolvent insurance companies (including long-term care insurers),HMOs, ACA co-ops and other payors to policyholders and c
laimants. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, Aetna recorded a discounted estimated liabilityexpense of $231 million pret
ax for our estimated share of future assessments for long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and oneof its subsidiaries. Guaranty 
funds are maintained by state insurance commissioners to protect policyholders and claimants in the event that an insurer, HMO, ACAco-op and/or other payor beco
mes insolvent or is unable to meet its financial obligations. These funds are usually financed by assessments against insurersregulated by a state. Futur
e assessments may have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Extreme events, or the threat of extr
eme events, could materially impact our businesses and health care (including behavioral health) costs.Nuclear, biological or oth
er attacks, or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations, whether as a result of war or terrorism or otherwise; other man-made disasters; natur
al disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons or extreme weather conditions such asmajor or extended winter s
torms, droughts and tornados, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; epidemics; pandemics and other extreme events canaffect the U.S. economy in gene
ral, our industries and us specifically. In particular, such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events could result insignificant health c
are (including behavioral health) costs, which also would be affected by the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public healthagencies and other insure
rs. Such extreme events or the threat of45

such extreme events also could disrupt our supply chains and/or our distribution chains for the products we sell. In addition, our employees and those of ourvendors are concentrat
ed in certain large, metropolitan areas which may be particularly exposed to these events. Such events could adversely affect our businesses,operating results and cash 
flows, and, in the event of extreme circumstances, our financial condition or viability, particularly if our responses to such events are lessadequate than those of our co
mpetitors.We may be unable to achieve our environmental, so
cial and governance goals.We are dedicated to 
corporate social responsibility and sustainability and face pressures from our colleagues, customers, and stockholders to make significantadvancements in environm
ental, social and governance matters. In part to address these concerns, we established certain goals as part of our ESG strategy.Achievement of our goals is subj
ect to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail to achieve these goals orthat our colleagues, custo
mers, or stockholders might not be satisfied with our efforts. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability toexecute our operational strate
gies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; the availability and cost of renewableenergy and other mater
ials; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating toclimate-related goals; labor-related regulati
ons and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third party contractors; the actions ofcompetitors and compet
itive pressures; an acquisition of or merger with another company that has not adopted similar goals or whose progress towards reaching itsgoals is not as advanced as ours; 
and the pace of regional and global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. A failure to meet our goals could adversely affectpublic perception of our busin
ess, employee morale or customer or stockholder support.Further, an increasing per
centage of colleagues, customers, and stockholders considers sustainability factors in making employment, consumer health care andinvestment decisions. If we 
are unable to meet our goals, we may lose colleagues, and have difficulty recruiting new colleagues, investors, customers, or partners,our stock price may be
 negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively, all of whichwould have an adverse effec
t on our business, operating results, and financial condition.Risks From Changes in Public Policy and Other Legal and Regulatory Risks
We are subject to potential changes in public po
licy, laws and regulations, including reform of the U.S. health care system, which can adversely affect ourbusinesses. Entitlement program reform, if 
it occurs, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operations and/or operating results.The political environm
ent in which we operate remains uncertain. It is reasonably possible that our business operations and operating results could be materiallyadversely affected by legislati
ve, regulatory and public policy changes at the federal or state level, increased government involvement in drug reimbursement,pricing, purchasing and/or i
mportation and/or increased regulation of PBMs, including: changes to the regulatory environment for health care and related benefits,including Medicare, the ACA, and re
lated Public Exchange regulations; changes to laws or regulations governing drug reimbursement and/or pricing; changes tothe laws and regulations govern
ing PBMs’, PDPs’ and/or Managed Medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs; changes tolaws and/or regulations govern
ing drug manufacturers’ rebates; changes to laws and/or regulations governing reimbursements paid to pharmacists by and/orreporting required by PBMs; changes 
to immigration policies and/or other public policy initiatives. It is not possible to predict whether or when any such changeswill occur or what form any such 
changes may take (including through the use of U.S. Presidential Executive Orders). Other significant changes to health care andrelated benefits syst
em legislation or regulation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting tradebetween the United States and oth
er countries also are possible and could adversely affect our businesses. If we fail to respond adequately to such changes,including by implementing s
trategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our businesses, operations and operating resultsmay be materially adversely affected.
Efforts to amend the ACA and rela
ted regulations are possible. It is also possible that federal and state governments will continue to enact and seriously considermany broad-based legisla
tive and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and ourbusinesses. Further changes to fed
eral health care and related benefits laws, including the ACA, drug reimbursement and pricing laws, laws governing PBMsand/or laws governing PBMs’, PDPs’ and/or Managed Medi
caid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs, are probable. Wecannot predict the ef
fect, if any, that new health care and related benefits legislation, future changes to the ACA or the implementation of or failure to implementthe outstanding provisions of ACA, may have on our He
alth Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and/or retail pharmacy, LTC pharmacy operations and/or operatingresults. The federal and 
many46

state governments also are considering changes in the interpretation, enforcement and/or application of existing programs, laws and regulations, including changesto payments under and funding of Med
icare and Medicaid programs and increased regulation of PBMs.Further, changes in existing f
ederal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to additional regulation of PBMs (includingnetwork restrictions, f
ormulary management affiliate reimbursement, contractual guarantees and reconciliations, or other PBM services), drug pricing orpurchasing, patent term 
extensions and/or purchase discount and/or rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers also could reduce the discounts or rebates wereceive. Changes in existing 
federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing, including ourability to use MAC lists and coll
ect transmission fees, also could adversely affect our profitability. For example, on October 29, 2020, the HHS released a final rulerequiring health insure
rs to disclose drug pricing and cost-sharing information. The final rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in theindividual and group markets 
to disclose cost-sharing information upon request, to a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, which, unless otherwise indicated, for thepurpose of the final rules 
includes an authorized representative, and requires plans and issuers to disclose in-network provider rates, historical out-of-networkallowed amounts and the associ
ated billed charges, and negotiated rates for prescription drugs. While the specific regulation requiring PBMs to disclose negotiatedprice concessions was paused under 
federal guidance released in August 2021, if it resurfaces, the regulation may result in drug manufacturers lowering discountsor rebates, resulting in h
igher drug costs for patients and impacting the ability of the Company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products andservices to consumers.
In addition, in November 2020, the HHS rele
ased the Rebate Rule, which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the AKS for rebates frompharmaceutical co
mpanies to PBMs in Medicare Part D and in Medicaid MCOs, replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefit patientswith high out-of-pocket costs and 
to change the way PBMs are compensated. The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to the patient at the pointof sale and (ii) for f
lat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. The PCMA, which represents PBMs, has filed a suit inan effort to block the Reba
te Rule, claiming that the Rebate Rule would lead to higher premiums in Medicare Part D and was adopted in an unlawful manner. It isunclear whether the Rebat
e Rule will be enforceable, whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices, whether list prices in the privatemarket may also be redu
ced, and what the resulting impact will be to PBMs or the Company. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Act of 2021 delays the effective date ofthe rebate rule to Janu
ary 2026, and pending Reconciliation legislation would fully repeal the Rebate Rule.Additionally, the Consolidated Appropr
iations Act of 2021 was signed into law in December 2020 and contains transparency provisions requiring group healthplans and health insurance 
issuers to report certain prescription drug costs, overall spending on health services and prescription drugs, and information aboutpremiums and the impac
t of rebates and other remuneration on premiums and out-of-pocket costs to the Tri-Departments. No later than 18 months after the firstsubmission and bi-annually the
reafter, the Tri-Departments will release a public report on drug pricing trends, drug reimbursement, and the impact of drug priceson premiums. In August, the Tri-Depa
rtments deferred enforcement of both the December 2021 deadline for reporting 2020 plan year data and the June 2022deadline for reporting 2021 p
lan year data to December 2022.We cannot predict the 
enactment or content of new legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement, interpretation orapplication, or the ef
fect they will have on our business operations or operating results, which could be materially adverse. Even if we could predict such matters, itis not possible to elimina
te the adverse impact of public policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of one or more of the industries in whichwe compete. Examples of such ch
anges include: the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available forMedicare, Medicaid, dua
l eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs, increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing, purchasing and/orimportation, changing the 
laws and regulations governing PBMs’, PDPs’ and/or Managed Medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health careprograms, changing the tax t
reatment of health or related benefits, or significantly altering the ACA. The likelihood of adverse changes remains high due to stateand federal budgetary pr
essures, and our businesses and operating results could be materially and adversely affected by such changes, even if we correctly predicttheir occurrence.
For more information on thes
e matters, see “Government Regulation” included in Item 1 of this 10-K.If we fail to comply with applicab
le laws and regulations, many of which are highly complex, we could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions,including monetary penalties, or suffer brand and reputational harm.
47

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state, federal and international governmental authorities. The laws and regulations governingour operations and interpr
etations of those laws and regulations, including those related to human capital and climate change, are increasing in number andcomplexity, change frequ
ently and can be inconsistent or conflict with one another. In general, these laws and regulations are designed to benefit and protectcustomers, members and prov
iders rather than us or our investors. In addition, the governmental authorities that regulate our businesses have broad latitude tomake, interpret and en
force the laws and regulations that govern us and continue to interpret and enforce those laws and regulations more strictly and moreaggressively each year. 
We also must follow various restrictions on certain of our businesses and the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries put inplace by certain sta
te regulators.Certain of our Pharmacy Servi
ces and Retail/LTC operations, products and services are subject to:•
the clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs and other health care products and services,including claims rel
ated to purported dispensing and other operational errors (any failure by our Pharmacy Services and/or Retail/LTC operations to adhere tothe laws and regulations appl
icable to the dispensing of drugs could subject us to civil and criminal penalties);•
federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern our relationship with drug manufacturers, customers and consumers;•
compliance requirements under ERISA, including fiduciary obligations in connection with the development and implementation of items such as drugformularies and pref
erred drug listings; and•
federal and state legislative proposals and/or regulatory activity that could adversely affect pharmacy benefit industry practices.Our Health Care Benefits products 
are highly regulated, particularly those that serve Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible, dual eligible special needs and small groupCommercial customers 
and members. The laws and regulations governing participation in Medicare Advantage (including dual eligible special needs plans),Medicare Part D, Medicaid, 
and managed Medicaid plans are complex, are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for non-compliance.The scope of the practic
es and activities that are prohibited by federal and state false claims acts is the subject of pending litigation. Claims under federal and statefalse claims acts 
can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” suit, and we a re adefendant in a number of such p
roceedings. If we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a government program or if there is anadverse decision against us und
er the False Claims Act, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from participating in government health care programs,including Medicare Advantag
e, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs, and we also may be required to paysignificant fines and/or 
other monetary penalties. Whistleblower suits have resulted in significant settlements between governmental agencies and health carecompanies. The significan
t incentives and protections provided to whistleblowers under applicable law increase the risk of whistleblower suits.If we fail to comply with l
aws and regulations that apply to government programs, we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties, premium refunds,prohibitions on marketing or 
active or passive enrollment of members, corrective actions, termination of our contracts or other sanctions which could have amaterial adverse effect on our a
bility to participate in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, dual eligible, dual eligible special needs plan and otherprograms and on our operating r
esults, cash flows and financial condition.Our businesses, profitability 
and growth also may be adversely affected by (i) judicial and regulatory decisions that change and/or expand the interpretations ofexisting statutes and regu
lations, impose medical or bad faith liability, increase our responsibilities under ERISA or the remedies available under ERISA, or reducethe scope of ERISA pre-emption of st
ate law claims or (ii) other legislation and regulations. For example, in December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld anArkansas law that, among other th
ings, mandates a particular pricing methodology, establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is belowthe pharmacy’s acquisi
tion cost, permits a pharmacy to reverse and rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than thereimbursement rat
e, prohibits a PBM from reimbursing a pharmacy less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis, and permits a pharmacy todecline to dispense if th
e reimbursement is lower than the pharmacy’s acquisition cost. Also, in November 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitupheld a North Dakota law that regu
lates employer-sponsored ERISA health plans and certain PBM practices within Medicare.If our compliance or other systems and processes 
fail or are deemed inadequate, we may suffer brand and reputational harm and become subject to regulatoryactions and/or litigation.
48

In addition to being subject to extensive and complex regulations, many of our contracts with customers include detailed requirements. In order to be eligible tooffer certain produc
ts or bid on certain contracts, we must demonstrate that we have robust systems and processes in place that are designed to maintain compliancewith all applicable l
egal, regulatory and contractual requirements. These systems and processes frequently are reviewed and audited by our customers andregulators. If our systems 
and processes designed to maintain compliance with applicable legal and contractual requirements, and to prevent and detect instancesof, or the potential for, non
-compliance fail or are deemed inadequate, we may suffer brand and reputational harm and be subject to regulatory actions, litigationand other proceedings which may 
result in damages, fines, suspension or loss of licensure, suspension or exclusion from participation in government programsand/or other penalties, 
any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.We routinely are subject to lit
igation and other adverse legal proceedings, including class actions and qui tam actions. Many of these proceedings seeksubstantial damages which may not be covered by insurance. These pro
ceedings are costly to defend, may result in changes in our business practices, harm ourbrand and reputation and adversely affect our businesses and operating results.
PBM, retail pharmacy, mai
l order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, LTC pharmacy and health care and related benefits are highly regulated industries whoseparticipants frequently are s
ubject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings. We are currently subject to various litigation and arbitration matters,investigations, regulato
ry audits, inspections, government inquiries, and regulatory and other legal proceedings, both inside and outside the U.S. Outside the U.S.,contractual rights, t
ax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the U.S. Litigation related toour provision of professional se
rvices in our medical clinics, pharmacies and LTC operations is increasing as we expand our services along the continuum of healthcare.
Litigation, and particularly
 securities, derivative, collective or class action and qui tam  litigation, is often exp ensive and disruptive. Many of the legal proceedingsagainst us seek substantial d
amages (including non-economic or punitive damages and treble damages), and certain of these proceedings also seek changes in ourbusiness practices. Whil
e we currently have insurance coverage for some potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurersmay dispute coverage and/o
r the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded or costs incurred. In addition, some types of damages,like punitive damages, m
ay not be covered by insurance, and in some jurisdictions the coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all orsome forms of liabili
ty also may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.The outcome of litigat
ion and other adverse legal proceedings is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justifiable by the evidence or existing law orregulation can and do occur, 
and the costs incurred frequently are substantial regardless of the outcome. Litigation and other adverse legal proceedings couldmaterially advers
ely affect our businesses, operating results and/or cash flows because of brand and reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings, the cost ofdefending such proceedings, the 
cost of settlement or judgments against us, or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings. See Item 3 ofthis 10-K for additional info
rmation.We frequently are subject to regular and spec
ial governmental audits, investigations and reviews that could result in changes to our business practices and alsocould result in material refunds, fines, penalt
ies, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities and other sanctions.As one of the largest nationa
l retail, mail order, specialty and LTC pharmacy, PBM and health care and related benefits providers, we frequently are subject toregular and special gove
rnmental market conduct and other audits, investigations and reviews by, and we receive subpoenas and other requests for informationfrom, various federal 
and state agencies, regulatory authorities, attorneys general, committees, subcommittees and members of the U.S. Congress and other state,federal and interna
tional governmental authorities. For example, we have received CIDs from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division ofthe DOJ in connection with a curren
t investigation of our patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under Parts C and Dof the Medicare progra
m. CMS and the OIG also are auditing the risk adjustment-related data of certain of our Medicare Advantage plans, and the number of suchaudits continues to incre
ase. Several such audits, investigations and reviews by governmental authorities currently are pending, some of which may be resolved in2022, the results of which may be adv
erse to us.Federal and state governm
ents have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud, waste and abuse a priority. Fraud, waste and abuseprohibitions encompass a wide r
ange of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical and/or other covered services,improper marketing and vi
olations of patient privacy49

rights. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us and other industry participants are complex and subject to change, making it necessary for usto invest significant r
esources in complying with our regulatory and contractual requirements. Ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technicalregulatory scheme mean that 
our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. In addition, our medical costs and the medicalexpenses of our Health Care Benef
its ASC customers may be adversely affected if we do not prevent or detect fraudulent activity by providers and/or members.Regular and special governm
ental audits, investigations and reviews by federal, state and international regulators could result in changes to our business practices,and also could result in signi
ficant or material premium refunds, fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including suspension orexclusion from partic
ipation in government programs and suspension or loss of licensure. Any of these audits, investigations or reviews could have a materialadverse effect on our busin
esses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition or result in significant liabilities and negative publicity for us.See “Legal and Regulatory Proce
edings” in Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Our litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing as we off
er new products and services and expand in business areas beyond our historical corebusinesses of Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Servi
ces and Retail/LTC.Historically, we focused pri
marily on providing Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC products and services. As a result of our transformationprogram and other innovation 
initiatives, we are expanding our presence in the health care space and plan to offer new products and services (such as the homehemodialysis device we ar
e developing) which present a different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the products and services that we historically haveoffered.
The increased volume of busin
ess in areas beyond our historical core businesses and new products and services subject us to litigation and regulatory risks that aredifferent from the 
risks of providing Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC products and services and increase significantly our exposure toother risks.
We face unique regulatory and other challenges in our Medicare and Med
icaid businesses.We are seeking to substant
ially grow the Medicare and Medicaid membership in our Health Care Benefits segment in 2022 and over the next several years. Weface unique regulatory 
and other challenges that may inhibit the growth and profitability of those businesses.•
In January 2021, CMS issued its final notice detailing final 2022 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage ratesresulted in an increase in
 industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%. We cannot predict future Medicare funding levels, the impact of future federalbudget actions or ensure tha
t such changes or actions will not have an adverse effect on our Medicare operating results.•
The organic expansion of our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D service area is subject to the ability of CMS to process our requests for service areaexpansions and our ability to bui
ld cost competitive provider networks in the expanded service areas that meet applicable network adequacy requirements.CMS’ decisions on our requests for serv
ice area expansions also may be affected adversely by compliance issues that arise each year in our Medicareoperations.
•
CMS regularly audits our performance to determine our compliance with CMS’s regulations and our contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of theservices we provide to our Medi
care members. As a result of these audits, we may be subject to significant or material retroactive adjustments to and/orwithholding of certain pre
miums and fees, fines, criminal liability, civil monetary penalties, CMS imposed sanctions (including suspension or exclusion fromparticipation in govern
ment programs) or other restrictions on our Medicare, Medicaid and other businesses, including suspension or loss of licensure.•
“Star ratings” from CMS for our Medicare Advantage plans will continue to have a significant effect on our plans’ operating results. Only MedicareAdvantage plans with a star ra
ting of four or higher (out of five) are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. CMS continues to change itsrating system to make achie
ving and maintaining a four or higher star rating more difficult. Our star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affectedby the compliance issues th
at arise each year in our Medicare operations. If our star ratings fall below four for a significant portion of our Medicare Advantagemembership or do not match 
the performance of our competitors or the star rating quality bonuses are reduced or eliminated, our revenues, operating resultsand cash flows may be signific
antly adversely affected.50

•Payments we receive from CMS for our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status ofthe individuals we enroll. El
ements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the DOJ, the OIG and CMS itself. Substantial changes inthe risk adjustment mechani
sm, including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions, could materially affect the amount of our Medicarereimbursement, require us t
o raise prices or reduce the benefits we offer to Medicare beneficiaries, and potentially limit our (and the industry’s) participationin the Medicare program.
•
Changes to the ability of PBMs to have pharmacy performance programs in place for clients and report payments via direct and indirect reporting mechanismscould impact the Pharma
cy Services business.•
Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory andcompetitive pressures. Fur
ther, as a result of the ACA and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules, clients of our PBM business could decide to discontinueproviding prescription drug ben
efits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this phenomenon occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customermigration into Medica
re Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D products.•
Our Medicare Part D operating results and our ability to expand our Medicare Part D business could be adversely affected if: the cost and complexity ofMedicare Part D exceed ma
nagement’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; changes to the regulations regarding howdrug costs are reported
 for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; changes tothe applicable regulations im
pact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; the government alters Medicare Part D programrequirements or reduc
es funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; the government mandateduse of point-of-sale man
ufacturer’s rebates effective in 2022 continues; the government enacts price controls on certain pharmaceutical products in MedicarePart D; the government makes 
changes to how pharmacy pay-for-performance is calculated; or reinsurance thresholds are reduced below their current levels.•
We have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our Medicaid products due to difficulties with providers and third-partyvendors submitting claims 
in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions. As states increase their relianceon encounter data, these di
fficulties could affect the Medicaid premium rates we receive and how Medicaid membership is assigned to us, which could have amaterial adverse 
effect on our Medicaid operating results and cash flows and/or our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain Medicaidprograms.
•
If we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a CMS audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicablelaws and regulations, we could be subj
ect to fines, civil monetary penalties or other sanctions, including fines and penalties under the False Claims Act, whichcould have a materia
l adverse effect on our ability to participate in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D or other government programs, and on our operatingresults, cash flows and financ
ial condition.•
Certain of our Medicaid contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data. The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data isincreasingly importan
t to the success of our Medicaid programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performancestandards and, in part, to set p
remium rates. We have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collectaccurate, or to corr
ect inaccurate or incomplete, encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding, operating sanctions and financialfines and penalties for 
noncompliance. We have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providersand third-party vendors submi
tting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions. As states increasetheir reliance on encounter 
data, these difficulties could affect the Medicaid premium rates we receive and how Medicaid membership is assigned to us, whichcould have a materia
l adverse effect on our Medicaid operating results and cash flows and/or our ability to successfully bid for, and continue to participate in,certain Medicaid programs.
Programs funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government account for a signi
ficant portion of our revenues, and we expect that percentage toincrease.
Programs funded in whole or in part by 
the U.S. federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that percentage to increase. Asour government funded businesses grow, our 
exposure to changes in federal and state government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the variousgovernment funded programs in whi
ch we participate also increases.The laws and regulations governing p
articipation in Medicare Advantage (including dual eligible special needs plans), Medicare Part D, Medicaid, and managedMedicaid plans are comp
lex, are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for non-compliance. Federal, state and local governments have the right tocancel or not to renew the
ir contracts with51

us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available. Funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control, including generaleconomic conditions, c
ontinuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level andgeneral political 
issues and priorities.The U.S. federal government and our o
ther government customers also may reduce funding for health care or other programs, cancel or decline to renew contractswith us, or make changes that adv
ersely affect the number of persons eligible for certain programs, the services provided to enrollees in such programs, ourpremiums and our administ
rative and health care and other benefit costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results andcash flows. When federal fund
ing is delayed, suspended or curtailed, we continue to receive, and we remain liable for and are required to fund, claims fromproviders for providing servi
ces to beneficiaries of federally funded health benefits programs in which we participate. An extended federal government shutdownor a delay by Congress in raising th
e federal government’s debt ceiling also could lead to a delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation of federal governmentspending and a significant in
crease in interest rates that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, our ability to accessthe capital marke
ts and our businesses, operating results, cash flows and liquidity.Possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally can adv
ersely affect our PBM and Retail/LTC businesses.It is possible that the
 pharmaceutical industry, regulators, or federal policymakers may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace AWP orWAC, which are the pricing ref
erences used for many of our PBM and LTC client contracts, drug purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payoragreements and other con
tracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-serviceprograms have established ph
armacy network payments on the basis of Actual Acquisition Cost (“AAC”). The use of an AAC basis in fee for service Medicaidcould have an impact on re
imbursement practices in Health Care Benefits’ Commercial and other Government products. It is also possible that Congress may enactsome limited form of p
rice negotiation for Medicare. In addition, CMS also publishes the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (“NADAC”) for certain drugs;NADAC pricing is being adopted in an increas
ing number of states.Future changes to the use of AWP, WAC or to othe
r published pricing benchmarks used to establish drug pricing, including changes in the basis for calculatingreimbursement by federal and
 state health care programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs,the reimbursement we r
eceive from our PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with drug manufacturers, wholesalers,PBMs and retail pharmacies. A f
ailure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increasescould have a materia
l adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections.We cannot predict the 
effect of these possible changes on our businesses.We may not be able to obtain adequate prem
ium rate increases in our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which would have an adverse effect on ourrevenues, MBRs and operating results and could magnify the adverse impa
ct of increases in health care and other benefit costs and of ACA assessments, feesand taxes.
Premium rates for our Insu
red Health Care Benefits products generally must be filed with state insurance regulators and are subject to their approval, which createsrisk for us in the current po
litical and regulatory environment. The ACA generally requires a review by HHS in conjunction with state regulators of premium rateincreases that exce
ed a federally specified threshold (or lower state-specific thresholds set by states determined by HHS to have adequate processes). Rate reviewscan magnify the adverse 
impact on our operating margins, MBRs and operating results of increases in health care and other benefit costs, increased utilization ofcovered services, and ACA assessments, 
fees and taxes, by restricting our ability to reflect these increases and/or these assessments, fees and taxes in our pricing.Further, our ability to re
flect ACA assessments, fees and taxes in our Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP premium rates is limited.Since 2013, HHS has issued determinations to h
ealth plans that their premium rate increases were “unreasonable,” and we continue to experience challenges toappropriate premium rate increases
 in certain states. Regulators or legislatures in several states have implemented or are considering limits on premium rateincreases, either by en
forcing existing legal requirements more stringently or proposing different regulatory standards. Regulators or legislatures in several statesalso have conducted hearings on p
roposed premium rate increases, which can result, and in some instances have resulted, in substantial delays in implementingproposed rate increases 
even if they ultimately are approved. Our plans can be excluded from participating in small group Public Exchanges if they are deemed tohave a history of “unreasonab
le” rate increases. Any significant rate increases we may request heighten the risks of adverse publicity, adverse regulatory action andadverse selection and the
52

likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied, reduced or delayed, which could adversely affect our MBRs and lead to operating margincompression.
We anticipate cont
inued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rates in our Insured Health Care Benefits products. We may not be ableto obtain rates that a
re actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policies profitable in one or more product lines or geographies. If we are unable toobtain adequate premium rates
 and/or premium rate increases, it could materially and adversely affect our operating margins and MBRs and our ability to earnadequate returns on Insured He
alth Care Benefits products in one or more states or cause us to withdraw from certain geographies and/or products.Minimum MLR rebate requirements limi
t the level of margin we can earn in our Insured Health Care Benefits products while leaving us exposed to higherthan expected medical costs. Challenges 
to our minimum MLR rebate methodology and/or reports could adversely affect our operating results.The ACA’s minimum MLR rebate requir
ements limit the level of margin we can earn in Health Care Benefits’ Commercial Insured and Medicare Insuredbusinesses. CMS minimum MLR rebate regu
lations limit the level of margin we can earn in our Medicaid Insured business. Certain portions of our Health CareBenefits Medicaid and FEHB program busin
ess also are subject to minimum MLR rebate requirements in addition to but separate from those imposed by the ACA.Minimum MLR rebate requir
ements leave us exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in our pricing. The process supporting the managementand determination of th
e amount of MLR rebates payable is complex and requires judgment, and the minimum MLR reporting requirements are detailed. CMS hasalso proposed, but not yet final
ized, a definition of “prescription drug price concessions” for commercial MLR calculation purposes, which would make additionalPBM information available 
to plans and the HHS, potentially further complicating the MLR calculation process. Federal and state auditors are challenging ourCommercial Health Care Ben
efits business’ compliance with the ACA’s minimum MLR requirements as well as our FEHB plans’ compliance with OPM’s FEHBprogram-specific m
inimum MLR requirements. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also are subject to minimum MLR audits. If a Medicare Advantage orMedicare Part D contrac
t pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to enroll new members. If a Medicare Advantage orMedicare Part D contrac
t pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. Additional challenges to our methodology and/or reportsrelating to minimum MLR and 
related rebates by federal and state regulators and private litigants are reasonably possible. The outcome of these audits andadditional challenges 
could adversely affect our operating results.Our operating results may be adversely aff
ected by changes in laws and policies governing employers and by union organizing activity.Congress and certain state 
legislatures continue to consider and pass legislation that increases our costs of doing business, including increased minimum wages andrequiring employers to prov
ide paid sick leave or paid family leave. In addition, our employee-related operating costs may be increased by union organizingactivity and it is possibl
e that the National Labor Relations Board may adopt regulatory changes through re-making or case law that could facilitate unionorganizing. If we are unabl
e to reflect these increased expenses in our pricing or otherwise modify our operations to mitigate the effects of such increases, ouroperating results will be 
adversely affected.We face international politica
l, legal and compliance, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that may be more significant than in our domesticoperations.
Our international opera
tions present political, legal, compliance, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significantthan in our domestic opera
tions. These risks vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands, governmentintervention and censorship, d
iscriminatory regulation, climate change regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets and pricing constraints. Ourinternational products nee
d to meet country-specific customer and member preferences as well as country-specific legal requirements, including those related tolicensing, data privacy, d
ata storage and data protection.Our international opera
tions increase our exposure to, and require us to devote significant management resources to implement controls and systems to complywith, the privacy and data pro
tection laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as the EU’s GDPR, and the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering lawsof the United States (includ
ing the FCPA) and the United Kingdom (including the UK Bribery Act) and similar laws in other jurisdictions. Implementing ourcompliance policies, 
internal controls and other systems upon our expansion into new countries and geographies may require the investment of considerablemanagement time and financial an
d other resources over several years before any significant revenues or profits are generated. Violations of these laws andregulations could result 
in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business, andsignificant brand and repu
tational harm. We53

must regularly reassess the size, capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, and must have effective change managementprocesses and internal con
trols in place to address changes in our businesses and operations. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risksand manage these diffi
culties, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our brand, reputation, businesses, operating results and/or financialcondition.
Our international opera
tions require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages, cultures, legal and regulatory schemes and timezones. Our international ope
rations encounter labor laws, standards and customs that can be difficult and make employee relationships less flexible than in ourdomestic operations and exp
ensive to modify or terminate. In some countries we are required to, or choose to, operate with local business associates, whichrequires us to manage our r
elationships with these third parties and may reduce our operational flexibility and ability to quickly respond to business challenges.In some countries we may be expos
ed to currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds internationally or converting localcurrencies into U.S. dollars or o
ther currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues, operating results and cash flowsfrom our internationa
l operations. Some of our operations are, and are increasingly likely to be, in emerging markets where these risks are heightened. Anymeasures we may implement t
o reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks on our international operations may not be effective.Risks Associated with Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures
We may be unable to successfully integra
te companies we acquire.Upon the closing of any acquisition we 
complete, we will need to successfully integrate the products, services and related assets, as well as internal controls intoour business operations. If an a
cquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, its products, services and related assets into our company alsomay be complex and time
-consuming and, if the integration is not fully successful, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies and/orgrowth opportunities of an acquis
ition. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:•
Integrating personnel, operations and systems (including internal control environments and compliance policies), while maintaining focus on producing anddelivering consistent, high qu
ality products and services;•
Coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;•
Disrupting management’s attention from our ongoing business operations;•
Retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;•
Managing inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations; and•
Reconciling post-acquisition costs and liabilities between buyer and seller.An inability to realiz
e the full extent of the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies, innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of anacquisition, as well as any de
lays or additional expenses encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses andoperating results. Further
more, acquisitions, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increasedcompetition or chall
enges with respect to our products, services or service areas, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired businessincluding risks and liabil
ities associated with litigation involving the acquired business. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize anybenefit from our acquis
itions after we have expended resources on them.We expect to continue to pursue acquisitions, joint 
ventures, strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities, which may be unsuccessful, cause usto assume unanticipated liabiliti
es, disrupt our existing businesses, be dilutive or lead us to assume significant debt, among other things.We expect to continue to pu
rsue acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities as part of our growth strategy. In additionto the integration risks no
ted above, some other risks we face with respect to acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies include:•
we frequently compete with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources and a greater tolerance for risk, to acquire attractivecompanies;
•
the acquired, alliance and/or joint venture businesses may not perform as projected;54

•the goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of our acquisitions may be incorrectly valued or may become impaired;•
we may assume unanticipated liabilities, including those that were not disclosed to us or which we underestimated;•
the acquired businesses, or the pursuit of other inorganic growth strategies, could disrupt or compete with our existing businesses, distract management, resultin the loss of key employees, div
ert resources, result in tax costs or inefficiencies and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls,information technology syst
ems, policies, procedures and performance;•
we may finance future acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which would dilutethe ownership interests of our s
tockholders;•
we may incur significant debt in connection with acquisitions (whether to finance acquisitions or by assuming debt from the businesses we acquire);•
we may not have the expertise to manage and profitably grow the businesses we acquire, and we may need to rely on the retention of key personnel and othersuppliers of businesses we acquir
e, which may be difficult or impossible to accomplish;•
we may enter into merger or purchase agreements but, due to reasons within or outside our control, fail to complete the related transactions, which could resultin termination fees o
r other penalties that could be material, cause material disruptions to our businesses and operations and adversely affect our brand andreputation;
•
in order to complete a proposed acquisition, we may be required to divest certain portions of our business, for which we may not be able to obtain favorablepricing;
•
we may be involved in litigation related to mergers or acquisitions, including for matters that occurred prior to the applicable closing, which may be costly todefend and may result in adv
erse rulings against us that could be material; and•
the integration into our businesses of the businesses and entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and regulations apply to us, includingsubjecting us to laws and regula
tions that did not previously apply to us.In addition, joint ventures p
resent risks that are different from acquisitions, including selection of appropriate joint venture parties, initial and ongoing governanceof the joint venture, join
t venture compliance activities (including compliance with applicable CMS requirements), growing the joint venture’s business in amanner acceptable 
to all the parties, including other providers in the networks that include joint ventures, maintaining positive relationships among the jointventure parties and the 
joint venture’s customers, and member and business disruption that may occur upon joint venture termination.Risks Related to Our Operations
Failure to meet customer expec
tations may harm our brand and reputation, our ability to retain and grow our customer base and membership and ouroperating results and cash flows.
Our ability to attract and
 retain customers and members is dependent upon providing cost effective, quality customer service operations (such as call centeroperations, PBM functions, retai
l pharmacy and LTC services, retail, mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription delivery, claims processing, customer caseinstallation and online 
access and tools) that meet or exceed our customers’ and members’ expectations, either directly or through vendors. As we seek to reducegeneral and administr
ative expenses, we must balance the potential impact of cost-saving measures on our customers and other services and performances. If wemisjudge the effects of s
uch measures, customers and other services may be adversely affected. We depend on third parties for certain of our customer service,PBM and prescription delivery ope
rations. If we or our vendors fail to provide service that meets our customers’ and members’ expectations, we may havedifficulty retain
ing or profitably growing our customer base and/or membership, which could adversely affect our operating results. For example, noncompliancewith any privacy or security 
laws or regulations or any security breach involving us or one of our third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on ourbusinesses, operating results, b
rand and reputation.We and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience 
cyber attacks. We can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect,prevent or contain the effects of such at
tacks or other information security (including cybersecurity) risks or threats in the future.We and our vendors have experi
enced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. As examples, the Company and itsvendors have experienced a
ttempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanning activity, andphishing emails. Attacks can o
riginate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states, or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicatesignificant resources 
and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are55

designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets againstattempts by unauthorized p
arties to obtain access to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service, or cause other damage. The impact of cyber attacks hasnot been material to 
the Company’s operations or operating results through December 31, 2021. The Board and its Audit Committee and Nominating andCorporate Governance
 Committee are regularly informed regarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status.A compromise of our informa
tion security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed,obtained, damaged, or used by unautho
rized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers andclients, financial 
institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financialcondition. Because the techn
iques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediatelyproduce signs of intrusion, we may be un
able to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Moreover, a data security breachcould require that we expend s
ignificant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnelfrom performing thei
r primary operational duties. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with,including key payors and vendors.
The costs of attempting to p
rotect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to an information security incident are significant. Large scale databreaches at other ent
ities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietaryinformation and of our custo
mers’, members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information. Following an information security incident, our and/or our vendors’remediation effor
ts may not be successful, and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers and members.In addition, breaches of our 
and/or our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized access to or dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietaryinformation or confiden
tial information about us, our customers, our members or other third-parties, could expose our customers’, members’ and otherconstituents’ private 
information and our customers, members and other constituents to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or 
misuse of this information, and result in investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, loss of customers,litigation or other a
ctions which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, reputation, businesses, operating results and cash flows.Data governance failures can adversely aff
ect our reputation, businesses and prospects. Our use and disclosure of members’, customers’ and otherconstituents’ sensitive informat
ion is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels. We would be adversely affected if we or our business associates or othervendors fail to adequately protec
t members’, customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information.Our information systems ar
e critical to the operation of our businesses. We collect, process, maintain, retain, evaluate, utilize and distribute large amounts ofpersonal health and finan
cial information and other confidential and sensitive data about our customers, members and other constituents in the ordinary course ofour businesses. Some of our informa
tion systems rely upon third party systems, including cloud service providers, to accomplish these tasks. The use anddisclosure of such informa
tion is regulated at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change and increasedenforcement activ
ity, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which went into effect January 1, 2020, the EU’s GDPR which began to apply across the EUduring 2018 and the audit program 
implemented by HHS under HIPAA. In some cases, such laws, rules and regulations also apply to our vendors and/or may holdus liable for any violat
ions by our vendors. International laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally morestringent than U.S. laws and regulat
ions, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations, or anysecurity breach, infor
mation security incident, and any other incident involving the theft, misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to,sensitive or confidenti
al customer, member or other constituent information, whether by us, by one of our business associates or vendors or by another third party,could require us to expend signi
ficant resources to remediate any damage, could interrupt our operations and could adversely affect our brand and reputation,membership and operating 
results and also could expose and/or has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation (including class action litigation),governmental investigation
s and enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutorydamages, consent orders, adve
rse actions against our licenses to do business and/or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows or financ
ial condition.Our businesses depend on our customers’, 
members’ and other constituents’ willingness to entrust us with their health related and other sensitive personalinformation. Events that 
adversely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our members or customers of our uses of their information, failing to keepour information technology sys
tems and our customers’, members’56

and other constituents’ sensitive information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of ouraction or inaction (in
cluding human error) or that of our business associates, vendors or other third parties, could adversely affect our brand and reputation,membership and operating 
results and also could expose and/or has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation (including class action litigation),governmental investigation
s and enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutorydamages, consent orders, adve
rse actions against our licenses to do business and/or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows or financ
ial condition. Large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security ofour information technology sys
tems and proprietary information and of our customers’, members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information. There can be noassurance that addition
al such failures will not occur, or if any do occur, that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated.Product liability, product recal
l or personal injury issues could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows and/or financial condition.
The products that we sell could b
ecome subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling, recall or other damage. In addition, errors in the dispensing,packaging or administra
tion of drugs or other products and consuming drugs in a manner that is not prescribed could lead to serious injury or death. Productliability or personal 
injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the drugs or other products we sell or services we provide. For example, we area defendant in hundreds of li
tigation proceedings relating to opioids and the sale of products containing talc. Our businesses involve the provision of professionalservices, including by pharm
acists, physician assistants, nurses and nurse practitioners, which exposes us to professional liability claims. Should a product or otherliability issue aris
e, the coverage available under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us from third parties may not be adequate toprotect us against the fi
nancial impact of the related claims. We also may not be able to maintain our existing levels of insurance on acceptable terms in the future.A product liability or person
al injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall, tampering, or mislabeling could damage our reputation and have a significantadverse effect on our busin
esses, operating results and/or financial condition.We face significant compet
ition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical toour success, and our failure to do so could adversely affe
ct our businesses, operating results and/or future performance.Our ability to attrac
t and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives. There is no guarantee we willbe able to attract 
and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased compensation and/or benefits costs. If weare unable to retain 
existing employees or attract additional employees, or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership, we could experience a material adverseeffect on our businesses, oper
ating results and/or future performance.In addition, our failure 
to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfullytransition into new roles cou
ld have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and/or future performance. The succession plans we have in placeand our employment arrang
ements with certain key executives do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us.Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability 
to attract and motivate internal sales personnel and independent third-party brokers,consultants and agents. New distribution channels create new disintermedia
tion risk. We may be subject to penalties or other regulatory actions as a result ofthe marketing practices of brokers and agents se
lling our products.Our products are sold primar
ily through our sales personnel, who frequently work with independent brokers, consultants and agents who assist in the productionand servicing of business. The indep
endent brokers, consultants and agents generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may frequently recommend and/ormarket health car
e benefits products of our competitors. Accordingly, we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance. Our sales could be adverselyaffected if we are un
able to attract, retain or motivate sales personnel and third-party brokers, consultants and agents, or if we do not adequately provide support,training and education to 
this sales network regarding our complex product portfolio, or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distributionchannels. This risk is heighten
ed as we develop, operate and expand our consumer-oriented products and services and we expand in the health care space and ourbusiness model evolves to includ
e a greater focus on consumers and direct-to-consumer sales, such as competing for sales on Insurance Exchanges.57

New distribution channels for our products and services continue to emerge, including Private Exchanges operated by health care consultants and technologycompanies. These chan
nels may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers and other customers in the selection and management of their healthcare benefits, in health care 
utilization and in the effective navigation of the health care system. We also may be challenged by new technologies and marketplaceentrants that could int
erfere with our existing relationships with customers and health plan members in these areas.In addition, there have be
en several investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care and other insurance products and thepayments they receive. Th
ese investigations have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and sellingthose companies’ products. For ex
ample, CMS and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agentswho market Medicare produc
ts. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and/or changesto industry practices, which 
could adversely affect our ability to market our products.Failure of our businesses to effective
ly collaborate could prevent us from maximizing our operating results.To maximize our overal
l enterprise value, our various businesses need to collaborate effectively. Our businesses need to be aligned in order to prioritize goals andcoordinate the design of new produ
cts intended to utilize the offerings of multiple businesses, including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs.In addition, misaligned in
centives, information siloes, ineffective product development and failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures, for examplesignificant financi
al decisions being made at an inappropriate level in our organization, also could prevent us from maximizing our operating results and/orachieving our financia
l and other projections.The failure or disruption of our information technology syst
ems or the failure of our information technology infrastructure to support our businesses couldadversely affect our reputation, businesses, op
erating results and cash flows.Our information system
s are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses,security breaches (includin
g credit card or personally identifiable information breaches), cyber attacks, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. If ourinformation systems ar
e damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and mayexperience reputational damage,
 loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions andimplement new and innovativ
e services. In addition, compliance with changes in U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including privacy and information securitylaws and standards, may cause us to 
incur significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.Our business success and operating results depend in part on effectiv
e information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implementimprovements in technology. Pursuing multiple 
initiatives simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly morechallenging.
Many aspects of our operations 
are dependent on our information systems and the information collected, processed, stored, and handled by these systems. We relyheavily on our computer syste
ms to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, claims processing, customerloyalty and subscription progr
ams, finance and other processes. Throughout our operations, we collect, process, maintain, retain, evaluate, utilize and distributelarge amounts of confide
ntial and sensitive data and information, including personally identifiable information and protected health information, that ourcustomers, members and oth
er constituents provide to purchase products or services, enroll in programs or services, register on our websites, interact with ourpersonnel, or otherwise commun
icate with us. In addition, for these operations, we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information overpublic networks.
We have many differen
t information and other technology systems supporting our businesses (including as a result of our acquisitions). Our businesses depend inlarge part on these syste
ms to adequately price our products and services; accurately establish reserves, process claims and report operating results; and interactwith providers, employer plan sponso
rs, customers, members, consumers and vendors in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion. In addition, recent trends towardgreater consumer engag
ement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Certain of ourtechnology systems (including so
ftware) are older, legacy systems that are less flexible, less efficient and require a significant ongoing commitment of capital andhuman resources to maint
ain, protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other systems. We must re-engineer and reduce the number of these systemsto meet changing consumer 
and vendor preferences and needs, improve our productivity and reduce our operating expenses. We also need to develop or acquirenew technology systems, contrac
t with new vendors or modify certain of our existing systems to support the consumer-oriented and transformation products andservices we are developing, op
erating and expanding and/or to meet current58

and developing industry and regulatory standards, including to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and emergingcybersecurity risks and th
reats. If we fail to achieve these objectives, our ability to profitably grow our business and/or our operating results may be adverselyaffected.
In addition, information 
technology and other technology and process improvement projects, including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs,frequently are long-t
erm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they arecomplete. If we do not eff
ectively and efficiently secure, manage, integrate and enhance our technology portfolio (including vendor sourced systems), we could,among other things, have proble
ms determining health care and other benefit cost estimates and/or establishing appropriate pricing, meeting the needs ofcustomers, consumers, provide
rs, members and vendors, developing and expanding our consumer-oriented products and services or keeping pace with industry andregulatory standards, and our op
erating results may be adversely affected.We are subject to payment-rela
ted risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and disrupt ourbusiness operations.
We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, mobile payments and potentially other technologies inthe future. Acceptance o
f these payment methods subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including paymentnetwork rules and operating guid
elines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirementsmay change in the future, whi
ch could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment options, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchangeand other fees, which could inc
rease periodically thereby raising our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including theprocessing of credit ca
rds, debit cards, and various other forms of electronic payment. If these vendors are unable to provide these services to us, or if their systemsare compromised, our oper
ations could be disrupted. The payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtainunauthorized access to, or 
exploit any weaknesses in, the payment systems we use. If we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements, or if data relating to ourpayment systems is comprom
ised due to a breach or misuse, we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties orsubject to fines and higher 
transaction fees. In addition, our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reducedsales and adverse effe
cts on our operating results.Both our and our vendors’ operations are subject to a variety of business cont
inuity hazards and risks, any of which could interrupt our operations orotherwise adversely affect our per
formance and operating results.We and our vendors are subjec
t to business continuity hazards and other risks, including natural disasters, utility and other mechanical failures, acts of war orterrorism, acts of c
ivil unrest, disruption of communications, data security and preservation, disruption of supply or distribution, safety regulation and labordifficulties. The occu
rrence of any of these or other events to us or our vendors might disrupt or shut down our operations or otherwise adversely affect ouroperations. We also may be sub
ject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life, or damage to property, resulting from such events. Althoughwe have developed procedures fo
r crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe arecustomary and adequate fo
r our size and industry, our insurance policies include limits and exclusions and, as a result, our coverage may be insufficient to protectagainst all potentia
l hazards and risks incident to our businesses. In addition, our crisis management and disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plansmay not be effective. Should 
any such hazards or risks occur, or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable, our businesses, operating results, cashflows and financial condit
ion could be adversely affected.Financial Risks
We would be adversely affected 
if we do not effectively deploy our capital.  Downgrades or potential downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, couldadversely affect our brand and reputation, businesses, operat
ing results, cash flows and financial condition.Our operations generate sign
ificant capital, and we have the ability to raise additional capital. The manner in which we deploy our capital, including investments inour businesses, our operations (such 
as information technology and other strategic and capital projects), dividends, acquisitions, share and/or debt repurchases,repayment of debt, reins
urance or other capital uses, impacts our financial strength, claims paying ability and credit ratings issued by nationally-recognizedstatistical rat
ing organizations. Credit ratings issued by nationally-recognized statistical rating organizations are broadly distributed and generally used throughoutour industries. Our ratings re
flect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations orobligations to our insureds. We b
elieve our credit ratings and59

the financial strength and claims paying ability of our principal insurance and HMO subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our Health Care Benefitsproducts to certain of our 
customers.Each of the ratings organi
zations reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future.Downgrades in our ratings could advers
ely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.Goodwill and other intangible assets could, in the future, becom
e impaired.As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $108.1 b
illion and $110.7 billion, respectively, of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill andindefinite-lived intangible as
sets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value maynot be recoverable. When 
evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. Weestimate the fai
r value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of areporting unit exceeds i
ts estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance.Indefinite-lived intangible as
sets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fairvalue of its indefinite-lived
 trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fairvalue, an impairment loss
 is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairmentwhenever events or changes in c
ircumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, theCompany first compares the 
carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimatedfuture cash flows used in this an
alysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment losscalculation compar
es the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted).Estimated fair valu
es could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment,adverse legal or regul
atory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows ormarket capitalization. Because 
of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncashcharges to our operating r
esults, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Adverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can signi
ficantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities,mortgage loans, alternative invest
ments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.The global capital ma
rkets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfoliothat supports our policy liab
ilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from ourinvestment portfolio is 
largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser extent the international financial markets; and volatility, uncertaintyand/or disruptions in the globa
l capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments’ monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, cansignificantly and advers
ely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:•
significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce ouroperating results and/or un
realized capital losses that reduce our shareholders’ equity;•
keeping interest rates low on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities (such as we have experienced during recent years) and thereby materiallyreducing our net investmen
t income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed ofcontinue to be reinvested 
in lower yielding securities;•
reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;•
causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio,mortgage borrowers and/or r
einsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;•
making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for example if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estim
ates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-to-period volatility in our net income and shareholders’ equity;60

•reducing our ability to issue short-term debt securities at attractive interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and decreasing our operating results;and
•
reducing our ability to issue other securities.Although we seek, within guidelines we dee
m appropriate, to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures, afailure adequately 
to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and, in extreme circumstances, our cash flows.Risks Related to Our Relationships with Manufacturers, Providers, Suppliers and Vendors
We face risks relating to the marke
t availability, pricing, suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs and other products that we purchase and sell.Our Retail/LTC segment and our ma
il order and specialty pharmacy operations generate revenues in significant part by dispensing prescription drugs. Our PBMbusiness generates revenues p
rimarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. As a result, we aredependent on our relationships wi
th prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers. We acquire a substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacies’prescription drug supply from 
a limited number of suppliers. Certain of our agreements with such suppliers are short-term and cancelable by either party withoutcause. In addition, these ag
reements may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than us. Certain of these agreements also allow pricing and otherterms to be adjusted per
iodically for changing market conditions or required service levels. A termination or modification to any of these relationships couldadversely affect our p
rescription drug supply and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, manyproducts distributed by our phar
macies are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. In some cases, we depend upon a single sourceof supply. Any such supply shortages or loss of any such s
ingle source of supply could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Much of the branded and generi
c drug product that we sell in our pharmacies, and much of the other merchandise we sell, is manufactured in whole or insubstantial part outside o
f the United States. In most cases, the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us. As a result, significant changes in taxor trade policies, ta
riffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, couldresult in significant 
increases in our costs, restrict our access to suppliers, depress economic activity, and have a material adverse effect on our businesses,operating results and cash 
flows. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes, as well as any negative sentimentstowards the United States in respons
e to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade regulations, could adversely affect our businesses.Our suppliers are independent 
entities subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside our control. If our current suppliers were to stop sellingprescription drugs to us or del
ay delivery, including as a result of supply shortages, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptciesof our suppliers, or for other 
reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or atall.
Our operating results may be adversely aff
ected if we are unable to contract with providers on competitive terms and develop and maintain attractive networkswith high quality providers.
We are seeking to enhanc
e our health care provider networks by entering into joint ventures and other collaborative risk-sharing arrangements with providers.Providers’ willingness to ente
r these arrangements with us depends upon, among other things, our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data tosupport these value-based con
tracts. These arrangements are designed to give providers incentives to engage in population health management and optimizedelivery of health ca
re to our members. These arrangements also may allow us to expand into new geographies, target new customer groups, increase membershipand reduce medical cos
ts and, if we provide technology or other services to the relevant health system or provider organization, may contribute to our revenue andearnings from altern
ative sources. If such arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract providers to sucharrangements, or are 
less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors, our medical costs may not be competitive and may be higher than weproject, our attrac
tiveness to customers may be reduced, we may lose or be unable to grow medical membership, and our ability to profitably grow our businessand/or our operating resul
ts may be adversely affected.While we believe joint ve
ntures, accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) and other non-traditional health care provider organizational structures presentopportunities for us, the imp
lementation of our joint ventures and other non-traditional structure strategies may not achieve the intended results, which couldadversely affect our op
erating results and cash flows.61

Among other things, joint ventures require us to maintain collaborative relationships with our counterparties, continue to gain access to provider rates that make thejoint ventures economically
 sustainable and devote significant management time to the operation and management of the joint ventures. We may not be able toachieve these object
ives in one or more of our joint ventures, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.If our suppliers or service providers fai
l to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be exposed tobrand and reputational harm, litigation and/or regulatory action. This risk 
is particularly high in our Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligiblespecial needs plan programs.
In addition to our suppliers, we con
tract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technologysystems. Our arrangements with supp
liers and these third parties may expose us to public scrutiny, adversely affect our brand and reputation, expose us to litigationor regulatory action, and o
therwise make our operations vulnerable if we fail to adequately oversee, monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meettheir contractual ob
ligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, including those related to human capital and climate change. For example,certain of our vendors have b
een responsible for releases of sensitive information of our members and employees, which has caused us to incur additional expensesand given rise to regulato
ry actions and litigation against us.These risks are particu
larly high in our in Medicare Advantage (including dual eligible special needs plans), Medicare Part D, Medicaid, and managed Medicaidplans, where third 
parties may perform medical management and other member related services for us. Any failure of our or these third parties’ prevention,detection or control syst
ems related to regulatory compliance, compliance with our internal policies, data security and/or cybersecurity or any incident involvingthe theft, misappropri
ation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, members’, customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information could requireus to expend significant resou
rces to remediate any damage, interrupt our operations and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose us towhistleblower, class action 
and other litigation, other proceedings, prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members, corrective actions, fines,sanctions and/or penalti
es, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.We may experience increased m
edical and other benefit costs, litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when providers that do not havecontracts with us render services to our Health Care Benef
its members.Some providers that render s
ervices to our Health Care Benefits members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-establishedunderstanding with these provide
rs as to the amount of compensation that is due to them for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount ofcompensation due to these nonpa
rticipating providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standardthat is not clearly translatable
 into dollar terms. In such instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitratetheir dispute with us or try to 
recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us from our members, which may result incustomer and member diss
atisfaction. For example, in October 2018, an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospitals approximately $150 million in a proceedingrelating to Aetna’s out-o
f-network benefit payment and administration practices, and in March 2019 that award was reduced to approximately $86 million. Suchdisputes may cause us to pay highe
r medical or other benefit costs than we projected.Continuing consolidation and integration among providers and other suppliers may increas
e our medical and other covered benefits costs, make it difficult forus to compete in certain geographies and creat
e new competitors.Hospitals and other providers and h
ealth systems continue to consolidate across the health care industry. While this consolidation could increase efficiency and hasthe potential to improve t
he delivery of health care services, it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting parties in certain geographies.These health systems also a
re increasingly forming and considering forming health plans to directly offer health insurance in competition with us, a process thathas been accelerat
ed by the ACA. In addition, ACOs (including Commercial and Medicaid-only ACOs developed as a result of state Medicaid laws), practicemanagement companies, 
consolidation among and by integrated health systems and other changes in the organizational structures that physicians, hospitals andother providers adopt continu
es to change the way these providers interact with us and the competitive landscape in which we operate. These changes may increaseour medical and other cov
ered benefits costs, may affect the way we price our products and services and estimate our medical and other covered benefits costs andmay require us to change our op
erations, including by withdrawing from certain geographies where we do not have a significant presence across our businesses orare unable to collabor
ate or contract with providers on acceptable terms. Each of these changes may adversely affect our businesses and operating results.62

ltimate number of shares the Company may receive will depend on the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’sstock over an averaging per
iod, less a discount. It is also possible, depending on such weighted average price, that the Company will have an obligation to Barclayswhich, at the Company’s option, could be s
ettled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASR, the maximum number of shares that could bedelivered to the Company is 29.0 m

in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K (this “10-K”), “Risk Factors” included in I
tem 1A of this 10-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-LookingStatements” in this 10-K.
Overview of Business
CVS Health Corporation, together with its subs
idiaries (collectively, “CVS Health,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is a diversified health solutionscompany united around a common pu
rpose of helping people on their path to better health. In an increasingly connected and digital world, we are meeting peoplewherever they are and chang
ing health care to meet their needs. The Company has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leadingpharmacy benefits man

illion patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insur
ance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescriptiondrug plan (“PDP”). The Company believes i
ts innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overallhealth care costs.
The Company has four reportable s
egments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.Overview of the Health Care Benefi
ts SegmentThe Health Care Benefits segm
ent operates as one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has theinformation and resourc
es to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The HealthCare Benefits segment

ll or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative services contract products (where the plansponsor assumes all or a majo
rity of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individualpublic health insurance 
exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.Overview of the Pharmacy Services Seg
mentThe Pharmacy Services segmen
t provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration,formulary managemen
t, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, theCompany provides specialty phar
macy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/orother administrativ

loyers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on PublicExchanges and private heal
th insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The PharmacyServices segment operates
 retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies andbranches for infusion and ent
eral nutrition services.Overview of the Retail/LTC Segment
The Retail/LTC segment sells p
rescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care servicesthrough its MinuteClinic
 walk-in medical clin ics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, coronavirus disease2019 (“COVID-19”) and shingles and conducts long-
term care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy®67

consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than9,900 retail locations, ne
arly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and onsite pharmacies. For the year endedDecember 31, 2021, the Company dispensed app
roximately 26.4% of the total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the United States.Overview of the Corporate/Other Seg
mentThe Company presents the rema
inder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•
Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and thecorporate relations, 
legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’sinvestments in its trans
formation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related integration costs; and•
Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.68

COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic and its emerging n
ew variants continue to impact the U.S. and other countries around the world. Our strong local presence and scale incommunities across the 
country has enabled us to continue to play an indispensable role in the national response to COVID-19, as well as provide seamless supportfor our customers wherever 
they need us: in our CVS locations, in their homes, and virtually. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Company’soperating results for th
e years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, primarily in the Company’s Health Care Benefits and Retail/LTC segments.Health Care Benefits Segment
Beginning in mid-Marc
h 2020, the health system experienced a significant reduction in utilization of medical services (“utilization”) that is discretionary and thecancellation of el
ective medical procedures. Utilization remained below historical levels through April 2020, began to recover in May and June 2020 and reachedmore normal levels in 
the third and fourth quarters of 2020, with select geographies impacted by COVID-19 waves. In response to COVID-19, the Companyprovided expanded benefit cov
erage to its members, including cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 related treatments, as well as assistance to members throughpremium credits, te
lehealth cost-sharing waivers and other investments. During 2020, COVID-19 also resulted in a shift in the Company’s medical membership.The Company experienced decl
ines in Commercial membership due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers, substantially offset by increases inMedicaid membership pr
imarily as a result of the suspension of eligibility redeterminations and increased unemployment.During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2021, overall medical costs in the first quarter were generally consistent with historical baseline levels in the aggregate,however the segment experi
enced increased COVID-19 testing and treatment costs and lower Medicare risk-adjusted revenue. During the second quarter, COVID-19 testing and treatmen
t costs persisted, however at levels significantly lower than those observed during the first quarter. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021,medical costs once aga
in increased primarily driven by the spread of emerging new variants of COVID-19, which resulted in increased testing and treatment coststhroughout the remainder o
f the year.Retail/LTC Segment
During March 2020, the Company experien
ced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills of maintenancemedications, as well as in
creased front store volume as consumers prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the second quarter and continuingthroughout the remainder
 of the year, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-placeorders as well as reduced new th
erapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, theCompany incurred incremen
tal operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees associated withprescription home deliv
ery and associated front store products. During 2020, the Company also played a key role in supporting the local communities in which itoperates through the admin
istration of diagnostic testing at its CVS Pharmacy locations, as well as in long- term care facilities, at community-based testing sites inunderserved areas and through 
its Return Readysolution. The Company also began admin istering COVID-19 vaccinations in long-term care facilities duringDecember 2020.
During the first quarter o
f 2021, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies, which reflected the impact of a weak cough, cold andflu season, while it adminis
tered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccines in its retailpharmacies during February 2021. Dur
ing the second quarter, the segment generated earnings from COVID-19 vaccines and saw improved customer traffic asvaccinated customers b
egan more actively shopping in CVS locations. During the third and fourth quarters, emerging new variants drove the continuedadministration of COVID-19 vaccin
ations (including boosters) and diagnostic testing, while the segment also generated earnings from the sale of over-the-counter(“OTC”) test kits in the fron
t store. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than59 million COVID-19 vaccines and sold mor
e than 22 million OTC test kits.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. 
We believe COVID-19’s impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial conditionprimarily will be driv
en by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies andconsumer behavior and
 health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and localgovernmental responses to th
e pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on ourbusinesses, operating results, 
cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.®SM

Revenues
•
Total revenues increased $23.4 billion or 8.7% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by growth across all segments.•
Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the revenues of the Company’s segments.Operating expenses
•
Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion or 5.5% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to incremental costsassociated with growth in the busin
ess, including costs associated with the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing in the Retail/LTCsegment. The increase in op
erating expenses was partially offset by the repeal of the non-deductible health insurer fee (“HIF”) for 2021 and gains from anti-trust legal settle
ments of $263 million recorded in 2021.70

•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 12.7% in 2021 compared to 13.1% in 2020. The decrease in operating expenses as apercentage of total revenues
 was primarily due to the increases in total revenues referred to above.•
Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating expenses of the Company’s segments.Operating income
•
Operating income decreased $718 million or 5.2% in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to:•
A store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to planned retail store closures over the nextthree years;
•
Decreased operating income in the Health Care Benefits segment, driven by higher COVID-19 related costs in 2021 compared to the prior year,including the impact of 
the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, aswell as the absence of pre
-tax income of $307 million associated with the receipt of amounts owed to the Company under the Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act and the Hea
lth Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) risk corridor program (“ACA riskcorridor receipt”); and
•
A $431 million goodwill impairment charge associated with the LTC business in the Retail/LTC segment recorded during the third quarter of 2021,partially offset by:
•
Increased prescription and front store volume and the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing in the Retail/LTC segment;•
Improved purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy in the Pharmacy Services segment;•
Gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $263 million recorded in 2021; and•
Lower acquisition-related integration costs in 2021 compared to the prior year.•
Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating income of the Company’s segments.Interest expense
•
Interest expense decreased $404 million in 2021 compared to 2020, due to lower debt in the year ended December 31, 2021. See “Liquidity and CapitalResources” later in this 
report for additional information.Loss on early extinguishment of debt
•
During 2021, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of approximately $2.3 billion of its outstanding sen ior notes inDecember 
2021 pursuant to its early red emption make-whole provision for such senior notes, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of$89 million
, and the repayment of approximately $2.0 bill ion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offer for such notes in August 2021, whichresulted in a loss on early 
extinguishment of debt of $363 million. During 2020, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repaymentof $6.0 billion of its outstanding s
enior notes pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes in August 2020, which resulted in a loss on earlyextinguishment of debt of $766 m
illion, and the repayment of $4.5 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes inDecember 2020, which resulted in 
a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $674 million. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item8 of this 10-K for additional in
formation.Income tax provision
•
The Company’s effective income tax rate decreased to 24.2% in 2021 compared to 26.3% in the prior year primarily due to the repeal of the non-deductibleHIF for 2021 and the favorable imp
act of a prior year refund claim approved by the Internal Revenue Service during the fourth quarter of 2021. The decreasewas partially offset by th
e absence of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2020.Loss from discontinued operations
•
In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1995 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a numberof former subsidiaries, 
including Linens ‘n Things and Bob’s Stores, each of which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The Company’s loss from discontinuedoperations in 2020
 primarily included lease-related costs required to satisfy these lease guarantees.71

•See “Discontinued Operations” in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ and “Lease Guarantees” in Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ includedin Item 8 of this 10-K for addi
tional information about the Company’s discontinued operations and the Company’s lease guarantees, respectively.72

Outlook for 2022With respect to 2022, the Company b
elieves you should consider the following important information:•
The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in itsMedicaid products. The proje
cted MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction inCOVID-19 related medical costs. 
While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment,the expectation is the 
impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.•
The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company’s ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continuedgrowth in specialty pharma
cy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.•
The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset bycontinued pharmacy rei
mbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s minimum wage investment. The Companyexpects that COVID-19 vaccinations 
and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Companyexpects to see continued st
rength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing andOTC test kit sales will be dependen
t upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and theavailability and adm
inistration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.•
The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company’s operating coststructure in a way that i
mproves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:•
Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,•
Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and•
Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.•
The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue topropose and enact signific
ant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company’s businesses.•
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19’s impact onits businesses, operating resu
lts, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration ofthe pandemic, as well as th
e pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns.In addition, as described in 
the “Government Regulation” section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed toreduce the transmission o
f COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, andhave resulted in a myri
ad of impacts on the Company’s businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, theimpact COVID-19 will have on the Company’s busin
esses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could beadverse and material.
The Company’s current expect
ations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the“Cautionary Statement Conce
rning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company’s actualresults to differ from tho
se currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.73

Segment AnalysisThe following discussion of segment op
erating results is presented based on the Company’s reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance forsegment reporting and is cons
istent with the segment disclosure in Note 17 ‘‘Segment Reporting’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company has three operating s
egments, Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company’ssegments maintain sepa
rate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on aregular basis in deciding how to 
allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of theCompany’s segments based on adjusted op
erating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization ofintangible assets and othe
r items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying businessperformance. See the r
econciliations of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excludedfrom operating income 
in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performanceas it enhances the Company’s ab
ility to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends.Non-GAAP financial measures the Company dis
closes, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to,financial measures d
etermined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.The following is a reconcil
iation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:In millions

Total revenues of the Pharmacy Services segment include approximately $11.6 billion, $10.9 billion and $11.5 billion of retail co-payments for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about retai
l co-payments.(2)
Intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Health Care Benefits segment, the Pharmacy Services segment, and/or theRetail/LTC segment. Intersegment adjusted operating 
income eliminations occur when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients (“PSS members”) enrolled in Maintenance Choiceelect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company’s retail pharmac
ies instead of receiving them through the mail. When this occurs, both the Pharmacy Services andRetail/LTC segments record the adjusted operating income on a s
tand-alone basis.(1)(2) _____________________________________________

The Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks,customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, techno
logy, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimateduseful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may no
t be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s GAAPconsolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segmen
t. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangibleassets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or
services. Additionally, intangible asset amortizat
ion expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believesexcluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the 
Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and toanalyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the
Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has no
t been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible assetamortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike 
the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless anintangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful 
life of an intangible asset is revised.(2)
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, acquisition-related integration costs relate to the Company’s acquisition (“Aetna Acquisition”) of Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”). The acquisition-related integration costs arereflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the 
Corporate/Other segment.(3)
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the store impairment charge relates to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with theplanned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the store impairment charges related to the write down of operating
lease right-of-use assets in connection with the planned closure of 68 underperforming retail pharmacy stores in 2019 and 2020. The store impairment charges are reflected in the Company’s
GAAP consolidated statements of operations within the Retail/LT

In June 2021, the Company received $61 million related to a purchase price working capital adjustment for an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2020. The resolution of thismatter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected 
in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2021 as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment.

In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately$850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in 
the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefitssegment. In 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the
elimination of the cumulative translat
ion adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income and is reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations inoperating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment.

In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the ACA’s risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsettingitems such as the ACA’s minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements and prem

Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020
Revenues
•
Total revenues increased $6.7 billion, or 8.9%, to $82.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by growth in the Government Services business,partially offset by th
e unfavorable impact of the repeal of the HIF for 2021 and the absence of the ACA risk corridor receipt.Medical Benefit Ratio 
(“MBR”)•
Medical benefit ratio is calculated as benefit costs divided by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefitsfor the Company’s Insured memb
ers. Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products,understand variances betwe
en actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investorswith information useful in 
assessing the operating results of the Company’s Insured Health Care Benefits products.•
The MBR increased from 80.9% to 85.0% in 2021 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related costs in 2021compared to the prior ye
ar, including the impact of the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in response to the COVID-19pandemic during 2020 and the rep
eal of the HIF for 2021, partially offset by improved underlying performance in the current year.Operating expenses
•
Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.•
Operating expenses decreased $215 million, or 1.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the repeal of theHIF for 2021, partially offset by 
incremental operating expenses to support the growth in the Government Services business described above and the netimpact of the sale of 
the Workers’ Compensation business sold on July 31, 2020.(1)_____________________________________________

Adjusted operating income•
Adjusted operating income decreased $1.2 billion, or 19.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven byhigher COVID-19 related costs in 2021 comp
ared to the prior year, including the impact of the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionaryutilization in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020. The decrease was partially offset by improved performance in the underlying GovernmentServices business and higher favo

lts.•
Medical membership as of December 31, 2021 of 23.8 million increased 436,000 compared with December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting increases inMedicare and Medicaid pro
ducts, partially offset by declines in Commercial self-insured membership.Medicare Update
On January 15, 2021, the U.S. Centers for Medicar
e & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued its final notice detailing final 2022 Medicare Advantage benchmarkpayment rates. Final 2022 Medi
care Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%.The ACA ties a portion of each Medic
are Advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five)to qualify for bonus payments. CMS rel
eased the Company’s 2022 star ratings in October 2021. The Company’s 2022 star ratings will be used to determine whichof the Company’s Medicare Advant
age plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2023. Based on the Company’s membership atDecember 31, 2021, 87% of the Company’s Med
icare Advantage members were in plans with 2022 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 83% of theCompany’s Medicare Advantage m
embers being in plans with 2021 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2020.78

Operating expenses•
Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; andexpenses related to spec
ialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.•
Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.Adjusted operating income
•
Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven byimproved purchasing economi
cs which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company’s group purchasing organization andspecialty pharmacy (includin
g pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continuedprice compression.
•
As you review the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•
The Company’s efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts theCompany receives from manu
facturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular,competitive pressures 
in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates,fees and/or discounts
 received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited theCompany’s ability to offer p
lan sponsors pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread,” and the Company expects these trends tocontinue. The “differen
tial” or “spread” is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors,by a PBM and the price paid for the d
rug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.Pharmacy claims processed
•
Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either ourretail network pharma
cies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processedand expected amounts as well 
as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understandingthe impact of pharma
cy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•
The Company’s pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claimsin 2020. The increase in pharm
acy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased newtherapy prescriptions, which we
re adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.•
The Company’s mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claimsin 2020. The increase in mai
l choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.•
Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prioryear.
Generic dispensing rate
•
Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment’s generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptionsprocessed or filled. Manag
ement uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are availableand clinically appropr
iate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors withinformation useful in unde
rstanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.•
The Pharmacy Services segment’s total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in thesegment’s generic dispens
ing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021.Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vacc
inations, the segment’s total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.80

Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020
Revenues
•
Total revenues increased $8.9 billion, or 9.8%, to $100.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased prescription andfront store volume, the ad

ales.•
Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescriptionvolume on a 30-day equivalent b
asis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impactof recent generic in
troductions.•
Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale ofOTC test kits, as well as increas
ed beauty and personal care sales in 2021.•
Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.Store impairments
•
During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assetsand property and equipment in 
connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ includedin Item 8 of this 10-K for addi

•
Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses,depreciation and amortization e
xpense and certain administrative expenses.•
Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increasedvolume including COVID-19 vaccinations 
and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment’s capabilities and colleague compensationand benefits. These i
ncreases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incrementalexpenses associated with the Comp
any’s initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.•
Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Adjusted operating income
•
Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by theadministration of COVID-19 vaccin
ations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drugpurchasing and gains from ant
i-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacyreimbursement pressur

The segment’s adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit saleswhich contributed approxima
tely 30% of the segment’s adjusted operating income in 2021.•
The segment’s adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental andother third-party payors 
to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of businesswithin the pharmacy portion o
f the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to growrevenues, and its adjusted ope
rating income could be adversely affected.•
The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment’s adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payorsaugmenting their effo
rts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects tocontinue, reduces the bene
fit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.Prescriptions filled
•
Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment’s pharmacies. Management uses this metric tounderstand variances betwe
en actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well82

as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescriptionvolume on segment total r
evenues and operating results.•
Prescriptions filled increased 8.4%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by COVID-19 vaccinations and the continuedadoption of patient car
e programs, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vacc
inations, prescriptions filled increased 4.3%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.Generic dispensing rate
•
Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Retail/LTC segment’s generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management usesthis metric to evalu
ate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aidsin decreasing costs for c
lient members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends insegment total revenues 
and operating results.•
The Retail/LTC segment’s generic dispensing rate decreased to 85.7% in 2021 compared to 88.3% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment’s genericdispensing rate was primar
ily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact ofCOVID-19 vaccinations, the segment’s 
total generic dispensing rate increased to 89.0% in 2021.83

Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020
Revenues
•
Revenues primarily relate to products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term careinsurance products.
•
Total revenues increased $295 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher net investment income, primarily driven byprivate equity investm
ents and increased net realized capital gains in 2021 compared to 2020.Adjusted operating loss
•
Adjusted operating loss increased $165 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs andincremental opera
ting expenses associated with the Company’s investments in transformation, partially offset by the increase in net investment income in 2021described above.

Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flows
The Company maintains a leve
l of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash andcapital structure to maximize share
holder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. The Company continuouslyassesses its regulatory c
apital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividendpayouts, potential share r
epurchases and future investments or acquisitions. The Company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, creditfacilities, as well 
as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. As of December 31, 2021, theCompany had approximately $9.4 bil
lion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $3.8 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonrestrictedsubsidiaries.
The net change in cash, cash equ
ivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:Change

•
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.4 billion in 2021 co mpared to 2020 due primarily to the timing of payments and higher operatingincome in the Retail/LT
C segment. The increase was partially offset by reduced benefit costs due to the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionaryutilization in the Hea
lth Care Benefits segment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which favorably impacted operating cash flows in 2020 and did notrecur during the curren
t year.•
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $273 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increased proceeds from the sale and maturity ofinvestments and a decre
ase in cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by the absence of $840 million in proceeds from the sale of the Workers’Compensation business in 2020 and incre
ased purchases of investments during 2021 compared to the prior year. In addition, cash used in investing activitiesreflected the fol
lowing activity:•
Gross capital expenditures remained relatively consistent at approximately $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2021,approximately 64% of the Comp
any’s total capital expenditures were for technology, digital and other strategic initiatives and 36% were for store,fulfillment and support 
facilities expansion and improvements.•
Net cash used in financing activities increased to $11.4 billion in 2021 compared to $7.7 billion in 2020. The increase in cash used in finance activitiesprimarily relat
ed to lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt during 2021 compared to theprior year.

ents’’ and Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about debtissuances, debt repayments, sh
are repurchases and dividend payments.Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of thesederivatives is genera
lly limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts,warrants, put options and credi
t default swaps.Debt Covenants
The Company’s back-up revolving cr
edit facilities, unsecured senior notes and unsecured floating rate notes (see Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’included in Item 8 of this 10
-K) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company’sdebt maturities in th
e event of a downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materiallyaffect its financ
ial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.Debt Ratings
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s long-t
erm debt was rated “Baa2” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’sFinancial Services LLC (“S&P”), and 
its commercial paper program was rated “P-2” by Moody’s and “A-2” by S&P. The outlook on the Company’s long-termdebt is “Stable” by Moody’s and “Posit
ive” by S&P. In assessing the Company’s credit strength, the Company believes that both Moody’s and S&P considered,among other things, the Company’s c
apital structure and financial policies as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity87

and other financial information. Although the Company currently believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot guarantee the futureactions of Moody’s and/or S&P. The Company’s deb
t ratings have a direct impact on its future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operatinglease costs.
Share Repurchase Programs
During the years ended Decembe
r 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. See Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’included in Item 8 of this 10
-K for additional information on the Company’s share repurchase program.Quarterly Cash Dividend
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the quarterly cash d
ividend was $0.50 per share. In December 2021, CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board”)authorized a 10% incre
ase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.55 per share effective in 2022. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter sincebecoming a public company. Futur
e dividends will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors consideredrelevant by the Board.

Total payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders’ funds include $728 m illion, $1.6 billion and $186 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject toreinsurance. The Company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolida
ted balancesheets.

Customer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $3.0 bill ion have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at thecustomer’s discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. Additionally, net unreal
ized capital gains on debtsecurities supporting experience-rated products of $92 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.
Restrictions on Certain Payments
In addition to general st
ate law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenanceorganizations (“HMOs”) and insur
ance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certainlevels of equity (ref
erred to as surplus) and restrict the(1)(1)

amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. These regulations are not directly applicable to CVS Health Corporation as aholding company, since CVS Health Corporation 
is not an HMO or an insurance company. In addition, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Companymade certain undert
akings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its HMOs and insurance companies. The additional regulations andundertakings applicable 
to the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the Company’s ability to service the Company’sdebt, meet other finan
cing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the Company’s subsidiaries to service their debt or other financing obligations.Under applicable regula
tory requirements and undertakings, at December 31, 2021, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by the Company’sinsurance and HMO subsidiaries without p
rior approval by regulatory authorities was $2.9 billion in the aggregate.The Company maintains capit
al levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of theselevels to meet liquid
ity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and stockholder dividends. In addition, at the Company’s discretion, it uses thesefunds for other purposes such as funding sh
are and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable.At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company held inv
estments of $450 million and $524 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as Separate Accountsassets but are legally s
egregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business. See Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-Kfor additional inform
ation on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.Solvency Regulation
The National Association of Insur
ance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) utilizes risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards for insurance companies that are designed toidentify weakly-capit
alized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the “RBC Ratio”). The RBC Ratio is designed toreflect the risk pro
file of insurance companies. Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the RBC Ratio decreases. Thereare four levels of regu
latory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC to the state insurancecommissioner to requir
ing the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. At December 31, 2021, the RBC Ratio of each of theCompany’s primary insurance subs
idiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action. The RBC framework described above for insurers has beenextended by the NAIC to health organi
zations, including HMOs. Although not all states had adopted these rules at December 31, 2021, at that date, each of theCompany’s active HMOs had a surplus that 
exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatoryaction under the NAIC’s RBC rules. External 
rating agencies use their own capital models and/or RBC standards when they determine a company’s rating.89

Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Company prepares the consolid
ated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to makecertain estimates and apply j
udgment. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to beimportant at the ti
me the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are appliedand disclosed in the
 consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered bymanagement support the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results coulddiffer from estimates, and s
uch differences could be material.Significant accounting pol
icies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Management believes the followingaccounting policies inc
lude a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. The Company has discussedthe development and sele
ction of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”), and the Audit Committee hasreviewed the disclosures r
elating to them.Revenue Recognition
Health Care Benefits Segment
Health Care Benefits revenu
e is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,which, in the Company’s Commercia
l business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at thetime the billings ar
e prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Governmentbusiness is collected month
ly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.The Company’s billings may be subsequen
tly adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known asretroactivity adjus
tments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As informationregarding actual re
troactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in whichthey arise. A significa
nt difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the Company’s operatingresults.
Premium Revenue
Premiums are recognized as
 revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance forestimated termin
ations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of theestimated minimum MLR rebate
s for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported asother insurance liabi
lities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.Some of the Company’s contracts 
allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustmentsare reasonably estimable at the
 outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under thecontract and the terms of t
he underlying contract.Services Revenue
Services revenue rela
tes to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct andaccounted for as separa
te performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange forperforming certain 
claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of theCompany’s administrative
 services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processingaccuracy and claim processin
g turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. Withany of these guarantees, th
e Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically islimited to a percen
tage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the termsof these guarantees and
 records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.90

Accounting for Medicare Part DRevenues include insurance pr
emiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangementswith CMS. The insurance premiums inc
lude a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case oflow-income members, and
 a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are thenrecognized ratably as 
revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.Revenues also include a risk-sh
aring feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable considerationin the form of amounts payab
le to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be receivedfrom or owed to CMS at the end of the r
eporting year.In addition to Medicare Pa
rt D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies a
nd coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference isrecorded in either a
ccounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retailpharmacy network. The Company’s phar
macy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are nocontractual minimum volumes a
nd each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time.PBM services performed in conne
ction with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing ofprescription drugs.
The Company recognizes revenue us
ing the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls theprescription drug before 
it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy networkbecause it has separate co
ntractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibilityfor fulfilling the pro
mise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.Revenues include (i) the por
tion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts andrefunds paid back to the cl
ient (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail orderprescriptions and the 
price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims basedadministrative fees for retail pharmac
y network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.The Company recognizes revenue when 
control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Companyexpects to be entitled 
to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for thePharmacy Services segment:
•
Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the clientplan member. At the tim
e of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does notexperience a significant level 
of returns or reshipments.•
Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees arerecognized at the Company’s po
int-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company hastransferred control o
f the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.For contracts under which the Company 
acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognizedusing the net method.
Drug Discounts
The Company records revenue net o
f manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. TheCompany estimates these
 rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. Theestimates are based on 
the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. TheCompany adjusts its rebates
91

payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recordedagainst revenues at the time
 it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebateadjustments, differen
ces between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicableformulary. The effect of adj
ustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results orfinancial condition.
Guarantees
The Company also adjusts revenues fo
r refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performancemetrics. The inputs to thes
e estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricingand performance refund 
amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Retail/LTC Segment
Retail Pharmacy
The Company’s retail drugstor
es recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is itsown arrangement with
 the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements.Revenues are adjusted for r
efunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service andperformance metrics. The inp
uts to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated andactual pricing and per
formance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Revenue from Company gift cards pu
rchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to beredeemed by customers (
i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.Customer returns are not m
aterial to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.Loyalty and Other Programs
The Company’s customer loyalty p
rogram, ExtraCare, consists of two components, ExtraSavings  and ExtraBucks  Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that arerecorded as a reduction o
f revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods orservices at the time of iss
uance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.ExtraBucks Rewards are accumul
ated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additionalperformance obligation to t
hose customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and theExtraBucks Rewards transaction bas
ed upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocatedto ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized 
as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contractliability.
The Company also offers a subscrip
tion-based membership program, CarePass, under which members are en titled to a suite of benefits delivered over the courseof the subscription period, as we
ll as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annualbasis at the time of or 
in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performanceobligations are satisfied.
Long-term Care
Revenue is recognized when contro
l of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expectsto be entitled to rec
eive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separateand distinct from other 
prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of long-term care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medicalproducts is reimbursed by the 
federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues andreceivables from these reimburseme
nt sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenuerecognition date to prope
rly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the totalrevenues and receivables re
ported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from thesepayors.

Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not collected atthe time products are d
elivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accountsreceivable colle
ctions procedures.Walk-In Medical Clinics
For services provided by the Company’s wa
lk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments takenfor third party payor c
ontractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.Impairments of Debt Securities
The Company regularly reviews i
ts debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debtsecurity is in an unreal
ized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell thesecurity before recov
ery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in netincome. If a debt secur
ity is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will nothave to sell such sec
urity before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components.The amount of the credit
-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit relatedcomponent is included in othe
r comprehensive income. The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment whenperforming this analysis, 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.In evaluating whether a c
redit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortizedcost basis; adverse condit
ions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of theissuer of the security to 
make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.During the years ended Decembe
r 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $42 million and $49 million,respectively. During the ye
ars ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not record credit-related impairment losses on debt securities. During the yearended December 31, 2019, the Company re
corded other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses on debt securities of $24 million.The risks inherent in
 assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts andcircumstances fac
tored into the Company’s assessment may change with the passage of time. Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that werenot present in past report
ing periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in priorreporting periods.
Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts
Vendor and manufacturer r
eceivables were $10.6 billion and $9.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the majority of which relate to purchasediscounts and vendor allowances as d
escribed below.Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalersand retail pharmac
ies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, ofthe following forms: (i) 
a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectlyfrom a manufacture
r (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized whenprescriptions are dispens
ed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect ofadjustments resulting f
rom the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company’s operating results orfinancial condition. The Comp
any accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed.The Pharmacy Services segmen
t also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition,the Pharmacy Services 
segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service feesare recorded as a redu
ction of cost of products sold.93

Retail/LTC SegmentVendor allowances received by 
the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the relatedinventory is sold, unless they ar
e specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amountsthat are directly linked to a
dvertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the relatedadvertising commitm
ent is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total valueof any upfront payme
nts received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reducecost of products sold over the l
ife of the contract based upon sales volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked topurchase commitments 
is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of therelated contract.
The Company establishes a rec
eivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trends and data. The majority of vendor receivablesare collected within the foll
owing fiscal quarter. Historically, adjustments to the Company’s vendor receivables resulting from the reconciliation of receivablesrecognized to the amounts 
collected have not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.There have not been any mat
erial changes in the way the Company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years.Inventory
Inventories are valued 
at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.The value of ending inventory is 
reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physicalinventory counts are taken on 
a regular basis in each retail store and LTC pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validatethe inventory balances 
on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properlystated. The Company’s accounting 
for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurredduring the interim per
iod between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physicalinventory results on a loca
tion-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.The total reserve for 
estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $522 million and $369 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,respectively. Althoug
h management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventorylosses, it is possible that a
ctual results could differ. In order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertaintiesdiscussed above, a ten percen
t (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reservefor estimated invento
ry losses by approximately $52 million as of December 31, 2021.Although management 
believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles,actual results could di
ffer from such estimates, and such differences could be material.Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Company determines if an 
arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlyingasset for the lease term and
 lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities are recognized at the c
ommencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value ofthe remaining future minimum lea
se payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes itsincremental borrowing r
ate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include leasepayments made before commenceme
nt and are reduced by lease incentives. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its right-of-use assets as described in“Long-Lived Asset Impairmen
t” below.The Company’s real estate 
leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options toextend are not considere
d reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic andstrategic incentiv
es of exercising the renewal options and94

regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associatedpayments are not included 
in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-realestate leases becaus
e they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are notrecorded on the balance sh
eets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.For real estate leas
es, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases requireadditional payments based on s
ales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed asincurred as variable lease co
sts. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance.These fixed payments are 
considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.Long-Lived Asset Impairment
Recoverability of Defin
ite-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the re
coverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment usingseparate tests descr
ibed below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. TheCompany groups and evaluates these 
long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators ofimpairment are pr
esent, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group(undiscounted). If the est
imated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation isprepared. The impairm
ent loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). Ifrequired, an impairm
ent loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted).The long-lived asset im
pairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales, profitabilityand cash flows. When preparing th
ese estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cashflow results and forecasts. Th
ese estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third partyorganizations to reduce 
their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumerspending patterns.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, 
the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores tocontinue to drive higher eng
agement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and futurehealth needs to ensure it h
as the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on November 17,2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corpora
tion (the “Board”) authorized the closing of approximately 900 stores over the next three years. The Companyexpects to close approxim
ately 300 stores each year between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment withrespect to the impac
ted stores’ asset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. A long-lived asset impairmenttest was performed during th
e fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups werelower than their respec
tive carrying values. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge ofapproximately $1.4 billion, 
consisting of a write down of approximately $1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million related toproperty and equipment, within 
the Retail/LTC segment.There were no materia
l impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, theCompany recorded st
ore impairment charges of $231 million, primarily related to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges.Recoverability of Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess o
f amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairmentreviews, or more frequent 
reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on areporting unit basis. The imp
airment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), includinggoodwill. The fair value of th
e reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net bookvalue (carrying amount
) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized inan amount equal to the exc
ess.95

The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimatesprimarily include the selection
 of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries inwhich the Company competes; discoun
t rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes,capital expenditures 
and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers eachreporting unit’s histori
cal results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. TheCompany’s estimates can
 be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; theCompany’s market capita
lization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; thecontinued efforts of comp
etitors to gain market share, consumer spending patterns and the Company’s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and executeon its cost reduction init
iatives.2021 Goodwill Impairment Test
During the third quarter of 2021, 
the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated animpairment of the goodwil
l associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The resultsof the impairment t
ests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The fair values of the reportingunits with goodwill exceeded the
ir carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business reporting unit, which exceeded itscarrying value by approxim
ately 3%.As discussed in Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Int
angibles’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K, during 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challengesthat have impacted th
e Company’s ability to grow the LTC reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed.These challenges include 
lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemicand the emerging new varian
ts, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company’s long-term care facility customersthan previously anticipa
ted. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan whichshowed deterioration in the 
financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annualimpairment test, which 
indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairmentcharge in the third quar
ter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a marketmultiple method. Subsequent to 
the impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2021, there is no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit.The Company has experienced dec
lines in its Commercial Insured medical membership subsequent to the closing date of the Aetna Acquisition and may continueto do so for a number of reasons, in
cluding as a result of the competitive Commercial business environment. In addition, COVID-19 and the emerging new variantshave had and may continue to hav
e an adverse impact on medical membership in the Commercial business due to reductions in workforce at existing customers(including due to business fai
lures) as well as reduced willingness to change benefit providers by prospective customers. The Company’s fair value estimate issensitive to significan
t assumptions including changes in medical membership, revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate. Although theCompany believes the financ
ial projections used to determine the fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit in the third quarter of 2021 were reasonableand achievable, the challen
ges described above may affect the Company’s ability to increase medical membership or operating income in the Commercial Businessreporting unit at the r
ate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed and may continue to do so. As of December 31, 2021, the goodwill balancein the Commercial Business r
eporting unit was $26.5 billion.2020 Goodwill Impairment Test
During the third quarter of 2020, 
the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that therewas no impairment of goodwill as o
f the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceedingtheir carrying values by s
ignificant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values byapproximately 6% and 12%, r
espectively.2019 Goodwill Impairment Test
During the third quarter of 2019, 
the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that therewas no impairment of goodwill as o
f the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceedingtheir carrying values by s
ignificant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values byapproximately 4% and 9%, r
espectively.96

Recoverability of Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible as
sets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying valuemay not be recoverable. 
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value ofthe asset exceeds its es
timated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.The indefinite-lived intangi
ble asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on theassumption that, in lieu of owne
rship of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Fair value isestimated by discountin
g the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected bya number of factors inclu
ding general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the Company. There were no impairmentlosses recognized on indefin
ite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.Health Care Costs Payable
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 75% and 77% respe
ctively, of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to theCompany’s Insured members but not y
et reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid (collectively,“IBNR”). Health care
 costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if theCompany is obligated to pay for such s
ervices in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. The remainder of health care costs payable is primarilycomprised of pharmacy and 
capitation payables, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments. TheCompany develops its estimat
e of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’included in Item 8 of this 10
-K for additional information on the Company’s reserving methodology.During 2021 and 2020, the Company observed an incr
ease in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. After considering the claims paidin 2021 and 2020 with dates of service p
rior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed assumed incurred claim weighted averagecompletion factors th
at were 21 and 4 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $207 million and $35 million in 2021and 2020, respectively, in hea
lth care costs payable that related to the prior year. The Company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factorswhen determining the compl
etion factors used in its estimates of IBNR as of December 31, 2021. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonablypossible that the Company’s est
imated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 13 basis points from the Company’s assumed rates, whichcould impact health c
are costs payable by approximately plus or minus $186 million pretax.Also during 2021 and 2020, the Company observed that h
ealth care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statementdate were lower than previous
ly estimated. Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2021 and 2020 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of theprevious year, the Company observed h
ealth care costs that were 5.0% and 4.0% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting ina reduction of $581 million 
and $394 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.Management considers histo
rical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developingestimates of curren
t health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2021, the Company increased its assumed health care cost trendrates for the most re
cent three months by 1.8% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. Health care cost trend rates during the past two years have beenimpacted by utiliza
tion changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact has not been uniform, with products and select geographies experiencingutilization impac
ts due to COVID-19 waves. Based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated health care cost trendrates may vary by plus or minus 3.5
% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $450 million pretax.Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income 
taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differencesbetween financial and tax
 reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporarydifferences revers
e. Such adjustments are recorded in the period97

in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extentfuture realizat
ion of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain.Significant judgment is r
equired in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in theordinary course of business, the
re are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company’s tax returns aresubject to audit by various dom
estic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. Althoughmanagement believes that its e
stimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared, actual results coulddiffer from these estimates resulti
ng in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.The tax benefit from an un
certain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxingauthorities, based on the t
echnical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are thenmeasured based on the
 largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and/orpenalties related 
to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. TheCompany has established accru
als for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances.New Accounting Pronouncements

Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disc
losures About Market Risk.The Company’s earnings and financ
ial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity riskand operational risk.
Evaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality Risk
The Company manages interest 
rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Companymanages credit quali
ty risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. Inconnection with its investm
ent and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partiallydetermined by, among other 
things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or creditratings/spreads. The Company’s use o
f these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury ratelocks, forward contracts, fu
tures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to varyingdegrees of interest r
ate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for hedging, the Company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk.Investments
The Company’s investment portfo
lio supported the following products at December 31, 2021 and 2020:In millions
2021 2020 Experience-rated products
$ 957 $ 1,037 Remaining products
25,185 22,775 Total investments
$ 26,142 $ 23,812 Investment risks associa
ted with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investmentssupporting experience-r
ated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by thecontract holders and not by th
e Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may besubject to contract hold
er or participant withdrawals.The debt securities in th
e Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2021 and 2020, with a fair value ofapproximately $6.7 billion 
and $6.3 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fair value of debt securities that were rated belowinvestment grade (tha
t is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) was $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (of which2% at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 support
ed experience-rated products).At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company held $305 m
illion and $321 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties,representing 1% of tota
l investments at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA at both December 31, 2021and 2020 with the guarantee. These s
ecurities had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, without theguarantee. The Company does not have 
any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or indirect).The Company generally classi
fies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31, 2021and 2020, less than 1% of debt secur
ities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance withaccounting principles gen
erally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information onthe methodologies and key assump
tions used to determine the fair value of investments. For additional information related to investments, see Note 3‘‘Investments’’ inc
luded in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company regularly reviews deb
t securities in its portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If adebt security is in an unre
alized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell thesecurity before recov
ery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in netincome. If a debt secur
ity is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will nothave to sell such sec
urity before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components.The amount of the credit
-related component is recorded as an allowance99

for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income. The impairment ofdebt securities is consid
ered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of Debt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 ofthis 10-K for additional info
rmation.Evaluation of Market Valuation Risks
The Company regularly evalua
tes its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term orlong-term), duration, pr
epayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investmentsrelative to manage
ment-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.On a quarterly basis, the Company r
eviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financialcondition, operating resul
ts and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest ratechanges (whether resulting 
from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for theCompany. The Company has estimated th
e impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using arepresentative set o
f likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates (whichthe Company believes repres
ents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and animmediate decre
ase of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.Assuming an immediate inc
rease of 100 basis points in interest rates, the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at December 31, 2021is as follows:
•
The fair value of long-term debt issued by the Company would decline by approximately $4.6 billion ($5.8 billion pretax). Changes in the fair value of long-term debt do not impact 
the Company’s operating results or financial condition.•
The theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest ratesensitive liabilities woul
d result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $680 million ($860 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-ratedproducts. Reductions in the fai
r value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debtsecurities as avail
able for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.If the value of the Company’s pub
licly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15%, this would result in a netdecline in fair valu
e of $14 million ($18 million pretax).Based on overall exposure to int
erest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affectconsolidated near-te
rm financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2021.Evaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity Risk
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not hav
e any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place andbelieves its exposure t
o foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.Evaluation of Operational Risks
The Company also faces cert
ain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and risks related to information security, includingcybersecurity.
The spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to 
mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively,including as a result of th
e complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages. Disruptions in our supply chains, our distribution chains and/or public andprivate infrastruc
ture, including communications, financial services and supply chains, could materially and adversely impact our business operations. We havetransitioned a signifi
cant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as have a significant number ofour third-party servic
e providers, which may amplify certain risks to our businesses, including an increased demand for information technology resources,increased risk of phishing and o
ther cyber attacks, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidentialinformation about us or our m
edical members or other third-parties and increased risk of business interruptions.100

The Company and its vendors have experienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. As examples, theCompany and its vendors have experi
enced attempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanningactivity and phishing ema
ils. Attacks can originate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continueto dedicate signific
ant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigatethe information secur
ity risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts byunauthorized parties to ob
tain access to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage. The impact of cyber attacks has not beenmaterial to the Company
’s operations or operating results through December 31, 2021. The Board and its Audit Committee and Nominating and CorporateGovernance Committee ar
e regularly informed regarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status.101

ices through its Coventry Health Care Workers’ Compensation business (“Workers’ Compensation business”) prior to the sale of this businesson July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits seg
ment’s customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, healthplans, health care provid
ers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insuranceproducts (where it assumes a
ll or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative services contract products (where the plansponsor assumes all or a majo
rity of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individualpublic health insurance 
exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration,formulary managemen
t, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, theCompany provides specialty phar
macy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/orother administrativ
e services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities (“Covered Entities”). The Pharmacy Services segment’s clientsare primarily emp
loyers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on PublicExchanges and private heal
th insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The PharmacyServices segment operates
 retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies andbranches for infusion and ent
eral nutrition services.Retail/LTC Segment
The Retail/LTC segment sells p
rescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care servicesthrough its MinuteClinic
 walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 andshingles and conducts long-ter
m care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and otherancillary services 
to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations,nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic loc
ations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies.®109

Corporate/Other SegmentThe Company presents the rema
inder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•
Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and thecorporate relations, 
legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’sinvestments in its transf
ormation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; and•
Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as its large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidat
ed financial statements of CVS Health and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United Sta
tes of America (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-ownedsubsidiaries and variable
 interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions havebeen eliminated.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amoun
ts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in theconsolidated financial statement
s and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-termmoney market funds, comme
rcial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanyingconsolidated balance she
ets, as these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash.Restricted Cash
Restricted cash (includ
ed in other current assets) represents funds held on behalf of members, including health savings account (“HSA”) funds associated with highdeductible health plans. Beg
inning in 2021, the Company began presenting these funds held on behalf of members in restricted cash and, for statement of cash flowpurposes, retrospectively 
adjusted the 2020 and 2019 balances by the amounts shown in the table below in the line item “restricted cash (included in other currentassets)” to conform with th
e current year presentation. Restricted cash (included in other assets) represents amounts held in a trust in one of the Company’s captiveinsurance companies to sa
tisfy collateral requirements associated with the assignment of certain insurance policies. All restricted cash is invested in time deposits,money market funds or comm
ercial paper.The following is a reconcil

InvestmentsDebt Securities
Debt securities consist pr
imarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate and foreign bonds and other debt securities. Debtsecurities are cl
assified as either current or long-term investments based on their contractual maturities unless the Company intends to sell an investment within thenext twelve months, in which case 
it is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities are classified as available for sale and are carried atfair value. See Note 4 ‘‘Fai
r Value’’ for additional information on how the Company estimates the fair value of these investments.If a debt security is in 
an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sellthe security before r
ecovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized innet income. If a debt se
curity is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company willnot have to sell suc
h security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit relatedcomponents. In evaluating wheth
er a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less thanthe amortized cost bas
is; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; thefailure of the issuer o
f the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. The amountof the credit-rel
ated component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component isincluded in other compreh
ensive income. Interest is not accrued on debt securities when management believes the collection of interest is unlikely.The credit-related component i
s determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security, considering all reasonablyavailable informa
tion relevant to the collectability of the security, with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to becollected is less than 
the amortized cost basis of the security, the Company records an allowance for credit losses, which is limited by the amount that the fair valueis less than amortized 
cost basis.For mortgage-backed and othe
r asset-backed securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and theestimated economic life of the 
securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date andanticipated future p
ayments. The Company’s investment in the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been appliedsince the acquisition of 
the security, with adjustments recognized in net income.Equity Securities
Equity securities with
 readily available fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income (loss).Mortgage Loans
Mortgage loan investments on 
the consolidated balance sheets are valued at the unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans witha maturity date or a 
committed prepayment date within twelve months are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company assesses whetherits loans share simila
r risk characteristics and, if so, groups such loans in a risk pool when measuring expected credit losses. The Company considers the followingcharacteristics when evaluatin
g whether its loans share similar risk characteristics: loan-to-value ratios, property type (e.g., office, retail, apartment, industrial),geographic location, vac
ancy rates and property condition.Credit loss reserves are d
etermined using a loss rate method that multiplies the unpaid principal balance of each loan within a risk pool group by an estimated lossrate percentage. The 
loss rate percentage considers both the expected loan loss severity and the probability of loan default. For periods where the Company is ableto make or obtain reasonab
le and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions (e.g., gross domestic product, employment), the Company adjusts itsexpected loss rates to r
eflect these forecasted economic conditions. For periods beyond which the Company is able to make or obtain reasonable and supportableforecasts of expected 
economic conditions, the Company reverts to historical loss rates in determining expected credit losses.Interest income on a pot
ential problem loan (i.e., high probability of default) or restructured loan is accrued to the extent it is deemed to be collectible and the loancontinues to perform under 
its original or restructured terms. Interest income on problem loans (i.e., more than 60 days delinquent, in bankruptcy or in process offoreclosure) is recogn
ized on a cash basis. Cash payments on loans in the process of foreclosure are treated as a return of principal.111

Other InvestmentsOther investments consist pr
imarily of the following:•
Private equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value ofthe investment is based on th
e value of the Company’s equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager of theinvestments, the financ
ial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by the fundmanagers, these investm
ents are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least quarterly andmonitors their perfor
mance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the Company becomes awareof an impairment of a limited 
partnership’s investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership’s financial statements at the financialstatement date, an i
mpairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited partnership with a corresponding charge to netinvestment income.
•
Investment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in fair val
ue. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real estateinvestment is considered h
eld-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company generally estimatesfair value using net oper
ating income and applying a capitalization rate in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time of the sale, thedifference between the sales
 price and the carrying value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss.•
Privately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments forobservable price changes. Addi
tionally, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”), a subsidiary of the Company is required topurchase and hold shares of the FHLBB. These shar
es are restricted and carried at cost.Net Investment Income
Net investment income on th
e Company’s investments is recorded when earned and is reflected in the Company’s net income (other than net investment income onassets supporting experienc
e-rated products). Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder, not theCompany, assumes investment and oth
er risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investmentperformance on experi
ence-rated products is allocated to contract holders’ accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does notimpact the Company’s net in
come (as long as the contract’s minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large casepensions’ experience-r
ated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders’ accountsthrough a charge to benefi
t costs. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected in policyholders’ funds on the consolidated balance sheets.Realized capital ga
ins and losses on investments (other than realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are included asa component of net in
vestment income in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized capital gains and losses are determined on a specific identificationbasis. Purchases and sales of debt 
and equity securities and alternative investments are reflected on the trade date. Purchases and sales of mortgage loans andinvestment real estate are reflected o
n the closing date.Realized capital ga
ins and losses on investments supporting large case pensions’ experience-rated products are not included in realized capital gains and losses inthe consolidated statements
 of operations and instead are credited directly to contract holders’ accounts. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected inpolicyholders’ funds on the consol
idated balance sheets.Unrealized capital g
ains and losses on investments (other than unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) arereflected in shareho
lders’ equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized capital gains and losses on investmentssupporting large case 
pensions’ experience-rated products are credited directly to contract holders’ accounts. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected inpolicyholders’ funds on the consol
idated balance sheets.Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of thesederivatives is genera
lly limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts,warrants, put options and credi
t default swaps.112

Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are state
d net of allowances for credit losses, customer credit allowances, contractual allowances and estimated terminations. Accountsreceivable, net is co
mposed of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020:In millions

edit losses was $339 million and $358 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. When developing an estimate ofthe Company’s expected cred
it losses, the Company considers all available relevant information regarding the collectability of cash flows, including historicalinformation, current 
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions over the contractual life of the receivable. The Company’saccounts receivable 
are short duration in nature and typically settle in less than 30 days.Inventories
Inventories are valued 
at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis ineach retail store 
and LTC pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in eachdistribution center and mail
 facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. During the interim periodbetween physical inventory coun
ts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical results andcurrent physical invento
ry trends.Reinsurance Recoverables
The Company utilizes
 reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance contracts.Ceded reinsurance agree
ments permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s primaryliability as the dir
ect insurer of the risks reinsured. Failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company could result in losses; however, the Company does not expectcharges for unrecoverable rei
nsurance to have a material effect on its consolidated operating results or financial condition. The Company evaluates the financialcondition of its reinsure
rs and monitors concentrations of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of its reinsurers.At December 31, 2021, the Company’s reinsu
rance recoverables consisted primarily of amounts due from third parties that are rated consistent with companies thatare considered to have th
e ability to meet their obligations. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balancesheets.
Health Care Contract Acquisition Costs
Insurance products included 
in the Health Care Benefits segment are cancellable by either the customer or the member monthly upon written notice. Acquisitioncosts related to prepaid 
health care and health indemnity contracts are generally expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs for certain long-duration insurancecontracts are deferred and are rec
orded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the estimated life of thecontracts. The amorti
zation of deferred acquisition costs is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2021 and2020, the balance of defer
red acquisition costs was $895 million and $546 million, respectively, comprised primarily of commissions paid on MedicareSupplement products within the Hea
lth Care Benefits segment.Property and Equipment
Property and equipme
nt is reported at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property, equipment and improvements to leased premises are depreciatedusing the straight-line 
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or when applicable, the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful livesgenerally range from 1 
to 40 years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for fixtures, equipment and internallydeveloped software. Repair and 
maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that113

substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Application development stage costs for significant internally developed softwareprojects are capitalized and de
preciated.Property and equipment consists o

er 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an impairment on propertyand equipment of $261 million 
in connection with the planned closure of certain retail stores. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about thisimpairment charge 
as well as the Company’s finance leases.Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Company determines if an 
arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlyingasset for the lease term and
 lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities are recognized at the c
ommencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value ofthe remaining future minimum lea
se payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes itsincremental borrowing r
ate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include leasepayments made before co
mmencement and are reduced by lease incentives.The Company’s real estate 
leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options toextend are not considere
d reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic andstrategic incentiv
es of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periodsare not included withi
n the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly,renewal options are n
ot included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at leasecommencement. Leases wi
th an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basisover the term of the shor
t-term lease.For real estate leas
es, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases requireadditional payments based on s
ales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed asincurred as variable lease co
sts. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance.These fixed payments are 
considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for add
itional information about right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.Goodwill
The Company accounts for business comb
inations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair valueof net assets acquired and 
identifiable intangible assets to be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment reviews annually, ormore frequently if ne
cessary, as further described in “Long-Lived Asset Impairment” below. See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additionalinformation about goodwill.
114

Intangible AssetsThe Company’s identifiable 
intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, trade names, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology,provider networks and value of busin
ess acquired (“VOBA”). These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair market valuesat the date of acquisi
tion. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation techniques andmanagement estimates.
The Company’s definite-liv
ed intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the asset.Other than VOBA, definite-lived int
angible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contractsin proportion to estimate
d premiums. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if necessary, asfurther described in “Long
-Lived Asset Impairment” below.See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangib
les’’ for additional information about intangible assets.Long-Lived Asset Impairment
The Company evaluates the re
coverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment usingseparate tests descr
ibed below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The Companygroups and evaluates these long
-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment arepresent, the Company first co
mpares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If theestimated future c
ash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairmentloss calculation compa
res the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss isrecorded for the portion o
f the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). During the year endedDecember 31, 2021, the Company record
ed a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion primarily related to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equip
ment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. There were no materialimpairment charges 
recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company recorded a store impairmentcharge of $231 million
 primarily related to operating lease right-of-use assets. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about the right-of-use assetimpairment charges.
When evaluating goodwill for po
tential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The Companyestimates the fai
r value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of areporting unit exceeds i
ts estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the third quarter of 2021, the Companyperformed its requir
ed annual impairment tests of goodwill, the results of which indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit.Accordingly, during the third qua
rter of 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge. The results of the impairment tests indicated thatthere was no impairment o
f goodwill of the remaining reporting units as of the testing date or during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the third quarter ofboth 2020 and 2019, the Company performed i
ts required annual goodwill impairment tests and concluded there were no goodwill impairments as of the testingdates or during the years end
ed December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about the goodwillimpairment charge 
recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.Indefinite-lived intangible as
sets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fairvalue of its indefinite-lived
 trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fairvalue, an impairment 
loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-livedintangible assets in any of 
the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.Separate Accounts
Separate Accounts assets and l
iabilities related to large case pensions products represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders who bearthe investment risk. T
hese assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income (including net realized capital gains and losses) accrue directly tosuch contract holders. The ass
ets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company’s other businesses. Deposits,withdrawals and net
115

investment income (including net realized and net unrealized capital gains and losses) on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statementsof operations or cash flows. Manag
ement fees charged to contract holders are included in services revenue and recognized over the period earned.Health Care Costs Payable
Health care costs payable
 consist principally of unpaid fee-for-service medical, dental and pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other amounts due to providerspursuant to risk-sharing ar
rangements related to the Health Care Benefits segment’s Insured Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products and accruals for stateassessments. Unpaid health ca
re claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured members butnot yet reported to the Company 
and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively,“IBNR”). Health care
 costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if theCompany is obligated to pay for such s
ervices in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Such estimates are developed using actuarial principlesand assumptions which consider, among o
ther things, historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, assumed and historical medical costtrends, historical uti
lization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in Insured membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors.The Company reflects changes 
in these estimates in benefit costs in the Company’s consolidated operating results in the period they are determined. Capitationcosts represent contractual m
onthly fees paid to participating physicians and other medical providers for providing medical care, regardless of the volume ofmedical services prov
ided to the Insured member. Amounts due under risk-sharing arrangements are based on the terms of the underlying contracts with theproviders and consi
der claims experience under the contracts through the financial statement date.The Company develops its estima
te of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. Of those factors, the Company considersthe analysis of historic
al and projected claim payment patterns (including claims submission and processing patterns) and the assumed health care cost trend rate(the year-over-yea
r change in per member per month health care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. In developing its IBNR estimate, the Companyconsistently applies thes
e actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been no significantchanges to the methodologies o
r assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of IBNR in 2021.The Company analyze
s historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates toestimate “completion factors.” T
he Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months beforethe financial statement date. T
he Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment andestimating the percentage of claim
s incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paidwithin six months of the date of s
ervice, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid.These historically-derived c
ompletion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a givenmonth’s incurred claim activity
. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents theCompany’s estimate of cl
aims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company’s health care costs payable. The completionfactors the Company uses ref
lect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and,to a lesser extent, othe
r factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submittedor processed on a faster (s
lower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company’s completionfactors, which may result 
in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.Because claims incurred 
within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derivedcompletion factors and the
 assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarialjudgment and places a 
greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced byseasonal patterns and chang
es in membership and product mix.The Company’s health care cos
t trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such services.Many factors influence 
the health care cost trend rate, including the Company’s ability to manage benefit costs through product design, negotiation of favorableprovider contracts and m
edical management programs, as well as the mix of the Company’s business. The health status of the Company’s Insured members, agingof the population an
d other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per member utilizationand unit costs. Changes in health c
are practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of116

prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs), direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity,changes in the regulatory 
environment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and theCompany’s health care cost 
trend rate.For each reporting period, th
e Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result, considerablevariability and uncertainty i
s inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financialstatement date; and 
the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. Foreach reporting period the
 Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential volatility in assumed completionfactors and health ca
re cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs payable is reasonable and adequate to coverits obligations at Decemb
er 31, 2021; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company’s estimates. A worsening (or improvement) of the Company’shealth care cost tr
end rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in estimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2021would cause these estimat
es to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.Each quarter, the Company re
-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and otherchanges in facts and cir
cumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company’s estimates of health care costspayable could develop eith
er favorably (that is, its actual benefit costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably. The changes in the Company’sestimate of health 
care costs payable may relate to a prior quarter, prior year or earlier periods. For a roll forward of the Company’s health care costs payable, seeNote 7 ‘‘Health Care Costs Payable.’
’ The Company’s reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of its ultimate liability for healthcare costs payable.
Other Insurance Liabilities
Unpaid Claims
Unpaid claims consist
 primarily of reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts, including an estimate forIBNR as of the financial stat
ement date. Reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts are based upon theCompany’s estimate of the p
resent value of future benefits, which is based on assumed investment yields and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity andrecoveries from the U.S. Socia
l Security Administration. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider,among other things,
 contractual requirements, claim incidence rates, claim recovery rates, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company discounts certainclaim liabilities related to group
 long-term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contracts. The discount rates generally reflect the Company’s expectedinvestment returns for the
 investments supporting all incurral years of these liabilities. The discount rates for retrospectively-rated contracts are set at contractuallyspecified levels. The Company
’s estimates of unpaid claims are subject to change due to changes in the underlying experience of the insurance contracts, changesin investment yields or oth
er factors, and these changes are recorded in current and future benefits in the consolidated statements of operations in the period theyare determined. The Company 
estimates its reserve for claims IBNR for life products largely based on completion factors. The completion factors used are basedon the Company’s historical exp
erience and reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim payment patterns,changes in business volume and othe
r factors. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than historical periods, the actual claims may be more(less) complete than originall
y estimated using completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required to cover future life benefitpayments. There have been no sign
ificant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of unpaid claims IBNR in 2021.As of December 31, 2021, unpaid claims b
alances of $324 million and $1.3 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insuranceliabilities, respe
ctively. As of December 31, 2020, unpaid claims balances of $532 million and $1.5 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and otherlong-term insurance liabilities,
 respectively.Substantially all lif
e and disability insurance liabilities have been fully ceded to unrelated third parties through indemnity reinsurance agreements; however, theCompany remains directly ob
ligated to the policyholders.Future Policy Benefits
Future policy benefits consis
t primarily of reserves for limited payment pension and annuity contracts and long-term care insurance contracts. Reserves for limitedpayment pension and annuity cont
racts are computed using actuarial principles that consider, among other things, assumptions reflecting anticipated mortality,retirement, expense 
and interest rate experience. Such assumptions generally vary by plan, year of issue and policy duration. Assumed interest rates on suchcontracts ranged from 3.0
% to 11.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021 and from 3.3% to 11.3% in the year ended December 31, 2020. The Companyperiodically reviews mo
rtality assumptions against both industry standards and its experience. Reserves for long-117

duration long-term care contracts represent the Company’s estimate of the present value of future benefits and essential maintenance expenses to be paid to or onbehalf of policyholders l
ess the present value of future gross premiums. The assumed interest rate on such contracts was 5.1% in both the years ended December31, 2021 and 2020. The Company’s estimate of 
the present value of future benefits under such contracts is based upon mortality, morbidity and interest rateassumptions. As of December 31, 2021, futur
e policy benefits balances of $416 million and $5.1 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liab
ilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, future policy benefits balances of $462 million and $5.5 billion were recorded in other insuranceliabilities and other long-term
 insurance liabilities, respectively.Premium Deficiency Reserves
The Company evaluates its insur
ance contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred. A premium deficiency loss is recognized when it isprobable that expected 
future claims, including maintenance costs (for example, direct costs such as claim processing costs), will exceed existing reserves plusanticipated future premiums an
d reinsurance recoveries. Anticipated investment income is not considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for short-duration contracts. For purposes o
f determining premium deficiency losses, contracts are grouped consistent with the Company’s method of acquiring, servicingand measuring the profit
ability of such contracts. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company established a premium deficiency reserve of $16 million and$11 million, respective
ly, related to Medicaid products in the Health Care Benefits segment.Policyholders’ Funds
Policyholders’ funds consist pri
marily of reserves for pension and annuity investment contracts and customer funds associated with certain health contracts.Reserves for such contracts 
are equal to cumulative deposits less withdrawals and charges plus interest credited thereon, net of experience-rated adjustments. In2021, interest rates for p
ension and annuity investment contracts ranged from 3.5% to 4.8%. In 2020, interest rates for pension and annuity investment contractsranged from 4.1% to 5.1%. Reserves 
for contracts subject to experience rating reflect the Company’s rights as well as the rights of policyholders and planparticipants. The Company also ho
lds funds for HSAs on behalf of members associated with high deductible health plans. These amounts are held to pay forqualified health ca
re expenses incurred by these members. The HSA balances were approximately $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020,respectively, and are 
reflected in other current assets with a corresponding liability in policyholders’ funds. These assets are considered restricted cash for cashflow statement purposes.
Policyholders’ funds liabil
ities that are expected to be paid within twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as current on the consolidated balancesheets. Policyholders’ funds li
abilities that are expected to be paid greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are included in other long-term liabilitieson the consolidated balanc
e sheets.Self-Insurance Liabilities
The Company is self-insured for 
certain losses related to general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. The Company obtains third party insurancecoverage to limit exposu
re from these claims. The Company is also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. The Company’s self-insurance accruals, which 
include reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, are calculated using standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions andthe Company’s historical c
laims experience. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, self-insurance liabilities totaled $1.1 billion and $927 million, respectively, and wererecorded as accrued exp
enses on the consolidated balance sheets.Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
For non-U.S. dollar functional curr
ency locations, (i) assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates, (ii) revenues and expenses are translated ataverage exchange rates in effect
 during the period and (iii) equity is translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting cumulative translation adjustments areincluded as a component of a
ccumulated other comprehensive income.For U.S. dollar functional curren
cy locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except fornonmonetary balance sheet
 accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effectduring each period, except 
for those expenses related to the nonmonetary balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or lossesfrom foreign currency 
remeasurement are included in net income.118

Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and the effects of foreign currency remeasurements were not material in the years ended December 31, 2021 or2020. On July 1, 2019, the Company sold its Brazilian subs
idiary, Drogaria Onofre Ltda. (“Onofre”) for an immaterial amount. The Company recorded a loss onthe divestiture, which
 included the elimination of the subsidiary’s $154 million cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive incomeduring the year ended Decemb
er 31, 2019.Revenue Recognition
Health Care Benefits Segment
Health Care Benefits revenu
e is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,which, in the Company’s Commercia
l business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at thetime the billings ar
e prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Governmentbusiness is collected month
ly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.The Company’s billings may be subsequen
tly adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known asretroactivity adjus
tments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As informationregarding actual re
troactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in whichthey arise.
Premium Revenue
Premiums are recognized as
 revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance forestimated terminations and u
ncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements of thePatient Protection and Afford
able Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”) is recorded net ofthe estimated minimum MLR
 rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reportedas other insurance liab
ilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.Some of the Company’s contracts 
allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustmentsare reasonably estimable at the
 outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under thecontract and the terms of t
he underlying contract.Services Revenue
Services revenue rela
tes to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct andaccounted for as separa
te performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange forperforming certain 
claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of theCompany’s administrative
 services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processingaccuracy and claim processin
g turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. Withany of these guarantees, th
e Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically islimited to a percen
tage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the termsof these guarantees and
 records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.Accounting for Medicare Par
t DRevenues include insurance pr
emiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangementswith the U.S. Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDPmember, and can be subsidiz
ed by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initiallyrecorded within other i
nsurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.Revenues also include a risk-sh
aring feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable considerationin the form of amounts payab
le to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be receivedfrom or owed to CMS at the end of the r
eporting year.119

In addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies a
nd coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference isrecorded in either a
ccounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retailpharmacy network. The Company’s phar
macy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are nocontractual minimum volumes a
nd each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time.PBM services performed in conne
ction with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing ofprescription drugs.
The Company recognizes revenue us
ing the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls theprescription drug before 
it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy networkbecause it has separate co
ntractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibilityfor fulfilling the pro
mise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.Revenues include (i) the por
tion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts andrefunds paid back to the cl
ient (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail orderprescriptions and the 
price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims basedadministrative fees for retail pharmac
y network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.The Company recognizes revenue when 
control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Companyexpects to be entitled 
to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for thePharmacy Services segment:
•
Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the clientplan member. At the tim
e of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does notexperience a significant level 
of returns or reshipments.•
Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees arerecognized at the Company’s po
int-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company hastransferred control o
f the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.For contracts under which the Company 
acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognizedusing the net method.
Drug Discounts
The Company records revenue net o
f manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. TheCompany estimates these
 rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. Theestimates are based on 
the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. TheCompany adjusts its rebates pay
able to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of theseadjustments is recorded a
gainst revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that haveretroactive reba
te adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in theapplicable formulary. The effect
 of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operatingresults or financial 
condition.Guarantees
The Company also adjusts revenues fo
r refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performancemetrics. The inputs to thes
e estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricingand performance refund 
amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.120

Retail/LTC SegmentRetail Pharmacy
The Company’s retail drugstor
es recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is itsown arrangement with
 the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements.Revenues are adjusted for r
efunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service andperformance metrics. The inp
uts to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated andactual pricing and per
formance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Revenue from Company gift cards pu
rchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to beredeemed by customers (
i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.Customer returns are not m
aterial to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.Loyalty and Other Programs
The Company’s customer loyalty p
rogram, ExtraCare, consists of two components, ExtraSavings  and ExtraBucks  Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that arerecorded as a reduction o
f revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods orservices at the time of iss
uance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.ExtraBucks Rewards are accumul
ated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additionalperformance obligation to t
hose customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and theExtraBucks Rewards transaction bas
ed upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocatedto ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized 
as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contractliability.
The Company also offers a subscrip
tion-based membership program, CarePass, under which members are en titled to a suite of benefits delivered over the courseof the subscription period, as we
ll as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annualbasis at the time of or 
in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performanceobligations are satisfied.
Long-term Care
Revenue is recognized when contro
l of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expectsto be entitled to rec
eive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separateand distinct from other 
prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of long-term care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medicalproducts is reimbursed by the 
federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues andreceivables from these reimburseme
nt sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenuerecognition date to prope
rly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the totalrevenues and receivables re
ported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from thesepayors.
Patient co-payments assoc
iated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not collected atthe time products are d
elivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accountsreceivable colle
ctions procedures.Walk-In Medical Clinics
For services provided by the Company’s wa
lk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments takenfor third party payor c
ontractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.®TM ® ®

Cost of products sold includes: (i
) the cost of prescription drugs sold during the reporting period directly through the Company’s mail service dispensingpharmacies and indire
ctly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network, (ii) shipping and handling costs, and (iii) the operating costs of the Company’s mailservice dispensing pharma
cies and client service operations and related information technology support costs including depreciation and amortization. The cost ofprescription drugs sold componen
t of cost of products sold includes: (i) the cost of the prescription drugs purchased from manufacturers or distributors and shippedto members in clients
’ benefit plans from the Company’s mail service dispensing pharmacies, net of any volume-related or other discounts (see “VendorAllowances and Purchase Discounts” below) 
and (ii) the cost of prescription drugs sold (including retail co-payments) through the Company’s retail pharmacynetwork under contracts where 
the Company is the principal, net of any volume-related or other discounts.Retail/LTC Segment
Cost of products sold includes: the 
cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period, including prescription drug costs, and the related purchasing costs,warehousing and delivery costs (
including depreciation and amortization) and actual and estimated inventory losses.Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts
The Company accounts for vendor al
lowances and purchase discounts as follows:Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalersand retail pharmac
ies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services segment to receive®®
 
 
123

purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for theprompt payment of invoices o
r (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (orrebate) paid subsequent to d
ispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturerswithin 30 days of the end of each co
mpleted quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amountsbilled and collected h
as not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The Company accounts for the effect of any such differencesas a change in accounting es
timate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Pharmacy Services segment also receives additional discounts under itswholesaler contracts if it e
xceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services segment receives fees from pharmaceuticalmanufacturers for ad
ministrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.Retail/LTC Segment
Vendor allowances received by 
the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the relatedinventory is sold, unless they ar
e specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amountsthat are directly linked to a
dvertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the relatedadvertising commitm
ent is satisfied. Any amounts received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of anyupfront payments received
 from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost ofproducts sold over the life o
f the contract based upon sales volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchasecommitments is also initially 
deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the relatedcontract. The total a
mortization of these upfront payments was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in any of the periods presented.Health Care Reform
Health Insurer Fee
Since January 1, 2014, the ACA has imposed an annual p
remium-based health insurer fee (“HIF”) for each calendar year, payable in September, which was notdeductible for tax purposes. Th
e Company has been required to estimate a liability for the HIF at the beginning of the calendar year in which the fee was payablewith a corresponding deferr
ed asset that was amortized ratably to operating expenses over the calendar year. The Company recorded the liability for the HIF inaccrued expenses and reco
rded the deferred asset in other current assets. In December 2019, the HIF was repealed for calendar years after 2020, therefore there wasno expense related to the HIF in 
the year ended December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses included $1.0 billion related to theCompany’s share of the HIF. There was no expens
e related to the HIF in 2019, since there was a one-year suspension of the HIF for 2019.Risk Adjustment
The ACA established a permanent r
isk adjustment program to transfer funds from qualified individual and small group insurance plans with below average riskscores to plans with above aver
age risk scores. Based on the risk of the Company’s qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of otherqualified plans in compa
rable markets, as defined by the ACA, the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable (recorded in accounts receivable) orpayable (recorded in accrued
 expenses) for the current calendar year and reflects the pro-rata year-to-date impact as an adjustment to premium revenue.Risk Corridor
The ACA established a temporary r
isk corridor program, which expired at the end of 2016, for qualified individual and small group health insurance plans. Underthis program, health insur
ance companies were to make payments to, or receive payments from, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”)based on their ratio of a
llowable costs to target costs (as defined by the ACA).The Company filed a lawsuit in August 2019 to 
recover the $313 million it was owed under the ACA’s risk corridor program, which had been stayed pending theSupreme Court decision. In April 2020, th
e U.S. Supreme Court ruled that health insurance companies may sue the federal government for amounts owed ascalculated under the ACA’s te
mporary risk corridor program.In October 2020, the Company receiv
ed the $313 million it was owed under the ACA’s risk corridor program. The Company recorded the risk corridor payment asan increase to premiu
m revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. After considering124

offsetting items such as the ACA’s minimum MLR rebate requirements and premium taxes, the Company recorded pre-tax income of $307 million and after-taxincome of $223 million during 
the year ended December 31, 2020.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs, which are redu
ced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed when the related advertising takes place. Net advertising costs, which areincluded in operating expens
es, were $523 million, $461 million and $396 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is m
easured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of thestock award (generally 
three  to five years) using the st raight-line method.Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income 
taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expectedfuture tax consequences of 
events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities aredetermined on the basis of 
the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect forthe year or years in 
which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in the tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized inincome in the period tha
t includes the enactment date of such change.The Company recognizes defer
red tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, theCompany considers
 all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxableincome, tax planning stra
tegies, and the Company’s recent operating results. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it does not consider it morelikely than not that a de
ferred tax asset will be recovered.The Company records uncertain 
tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the taxpositions will be sustained on the b
asis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognitionthreshold, the Com
pany recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxauthority.
Interest and/or penalties related
 to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision.Measurement of Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretir
ement Employee Benefit PlansThe Company sponsors defined benefit p
ension plans (“pension plans”) and other postretirement employee benefit plans (“OPEB plans”) for its employees andretirees. The Company recogn
izes the funded status of its pension and OPEB plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on the year-end measurements of planassets and benefit obliga
tions. When the fair value of plan assets are in excess of the plan benefit obligations, the amounts are reported in other current assets andother assets. When the fa
ir value of plan benefit obligations are in excess of plan assets, the amounts are reported in accrued expenses and other long-termliabilities based on th
e amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation exceeds the fairvalue of plan assets. The net p
eriodic benefit cost (income) for the Company’s pension and OPEB plans do not contain a service cost component as these planshave been frozen for an ex
tended period of time. Non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (income) are included inother income in the consol
idated statements of operations.Earnings per Share
Earnings per share is comput
ed using the two-class method. The Company calculates basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of commonshares outstanding for the pe
riod. See Note 14 ‘‘Earnings Per Share’’ for additional information.125

Shares Held in TrustThe Company maintains grantor 
trusts, which held approximately one million shares of its common stock at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. These shares aredesignated for use under var
ious employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic anddiluted shares outstanding.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company has
 investments in (i) a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity, (ii) certain hedge fund and private equity investments and (iii) certain real estatepartnerships that are 
considered VIEs. The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it mayvoluntarily contribute 
funds. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers several factors, including whether theCompany has (a) the power to dire
ct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses and theright to receive bene
fits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.Variable Interest Entiti
es - Primary BeneficiaryIn 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, 
Inc. (“Cardinal”) established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC (“Red Oak”), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in whichthe Company and Cardinal each own 50%. The Red Oak 
arrangement had an initial term of ten years. In 2021, the Red Oak arrangement was amended to extendthe initial term 
an additional five years, for a total term of 15 years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chainexpertise to Red Oak and agreed 
to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does notown or hold inventory on behalf of ei
ther company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak by either company, andminimal funding was provided to 
capitalize Red Oak. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because it has the ability to directthe activities of Red Oak. Consequen
tly, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within the Retail/LTC segment.Cardinal is required to pay 
the Company quarterly payments, which began in October 2014 and will extend through June 2029. As milestones are met, the quarterlypayments increase. The Company 
received $183 million from Cardinal during each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The payments reducethe Company’s carrying value o
f inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold. Amounts reimbursed by Cardinal for theyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and 
amounts due to or due from Cardinal at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial.Variable Interest Entiti
es - Other Variable Interest HolderThe Company has invested in cert
ain VIEs for which it has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary, consisting of the following:•
Hedge fund and private equity investments - The Company invests in hedge fund and pr ivate equity investments in order to generate investment returns for itsinvestment portfolio suppor
ting its insurance businesses.•
Real estate partnerships - The Company invests in various re al estate partnerships, including those that construct, own and manage low-income housingdevelopments. For the low income hous
ing development investments, substantially all of the projected benefits to the Company are from tax credits and othertax benefits.
The Company is not the primary ben
eficiary of these VIEs because the nature of the Company’s involvement with the activities of these VIEs does not give theCompany the power to direct the 
activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. The Company records the amount of its investment in theseVIEs as long-term investmen
ts on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes its share of each VIE’s income or losses in net income (loss). The Company’smaximum exposure to loss fro
m these VIEs is limited to its investment balances as disclosed below and the risk of recapture of previously recognized tax creditsrelated to the rea
l estate partnerships, which the Company does not consider significant.The total amount of other v
ariable interest holder VIE assets included in long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020was as follows:

Related Party TransactionsThe Company has an equity method inves
tment in SureScripts, LLC (“SureScripts”), which operates a clinical health information network. The Company utilizesthis clinical heal
th information network in providing services to its client plan members and retail customers. The Company expensed fees for the use of thisnetwork of $52 million, $56 mill

ed as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations within the Corporate/Other segment for the years endedDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Discontinued Operations
In connection with certa
in business dispositions completed between 1995 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number offormer subsidiaries, in
cluding Linens ‘n Things and Bob’s Stores, each of which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The Company’s loss from discontinuedoperations includes leas
e-related costs that the Company believes it will likely be required to satisfy pursuant to these lease guarantees. See “Lease Guarantees” inNote 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingen

Simplifying the Accounting for 
Income TaxesIn December 2019, the Financia
l Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). This standard simplifies th
e accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 740 related to theapproach for intraper
iod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outsidebasis differences. The st
andard also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting fortransactions that resu
lt in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The Company adopted this new accounting standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of thisstandard did not have a mat
erial impact on the Company’s consolidated operating results, cash flows, financial condition or related disclosures.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting 
for Long-Duration Insurance ContractsIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12, 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (Topic 944). This standard requi res theCompany to review cash flow assumptions 
for its long-duration insurance contracts at least annually and recognize the effect of changes in future cash flowassumptions in net income. This s
tandard also requires the Company to update discount rate assumptions quarterly and recognize the effect of changes in theseassumptions in other compreh
ensive income. The rate used to discount the Company’s liability for future policy benefits will be based on an estimate of the yieldfor an upper-medium grad
e fixed-income instrument with a duration profile matching that of the Company’s127

liabilities. In addition, this standard changes the amortization method for deferred acquisition costs and requires additional disclosures regarding the long durationinsurance contract liabilities in
 the Company’s interim and annual financial statements. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interimperiods within those fiscal y
ears, beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company will adopt the new standard on January 1, 2023, using the modifiedretrospective trans
ition method as of the earliest period presented for changes to the liability for future policy benefits and deferred acquisition costs. While theCompany is still evaluating 
the impact of the new standard on its financial statements, the Company anticipates an increase to its liability for future policy benefitswith a corresponding change in a
ccumulated other comprehensive income as a result of updating the rate used to discount the liabilities to reflect the yield for anupper-medium grade fix
ed-income instrument compared to the Company’s expected investment yield under the existing guidance.2.
DivestituresDivestiture of Workers’ Compensation Business
On July 31, 2020, the Company sold its Workers’ Compens
ation business for approximately $850 million. The results of this business were reported within theHealth Care Benefits segmen
t. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the divestiture of $269 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, which is reflected asa reduction in operating 
expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.Divestiture of Brazilian Subsidiary
On July 1, 2019, the Company sold its Brazilian subs
idiary, Onofre, for an immaterial amount. Onofre operated 50 retail pharmacy stores, the results of whichhistorically had been r
eported within the Retail/LTC segment. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of $205 million in the year ended December31, 2019, w
hich primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income and is reflected inoperating expenses in the Company
’s consolidated statement of operations within the Retail/LTC segment.3.

red to sell these securities prior to the anticipated recovery of their amortized cost basis.131

Fair ValueThe preparation of the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires certain assets and liabilities to be reflected at their fairvalue and others to be ref
lected on another basis, such as an adjusted historical cost basis. In this note, the Company provides details on the fair value of financialassets and liabiliti
es and how it determines those fair values. The Company presents this information for those financial instruments that are measured at fair valuefor which the change in fai
r value impacts net income attributable to CVS Health or other comprehensive income separately from other financial assets andliabilities.
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
Certain of the Company’s finan
cial instruments are measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of these instruments are based onvaluations that include 
inputs that can be classified within one of three levels of a hierarchy established by GAAP.  The following are the levels of the hierarchyand a brief description 
of the type of valuation information (“valuation inputs”) that qualifies a financial asset or liability for each level:•
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•
Level 2 – Valuation inputs other than Level 1 that are based on observable market data. These include: quoted prices for similar assets in active markets,quoted prices for identical
 assets in inactive markets, valuation inputs that are observable that are not prices (such as interest rates and credit risks) andvaluation inputs that ar
e derived from or corroborated by observable markets.•
Level 3 – Developed from unobservable data, reflecting the Company’s assumptions.Financial assets and liab
ilities are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the valuation. When quoted prices in active markets foridentical assets and liabilities
 are available, the Company uses these quoted market prices to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and classifiesthese assets and liabil
ities in Level 1. In other cases where a quoted market price for identical assets and liabilities in an active market is either not available or notobservable, the Company estim
ates fair value using valuation methodologies based on available and observable market information or by using a matrix pricingmodel. These financial 
assets and liabilities are classified in Level 2. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company determines fair value using brokerquotes or an internal ana
lysis of each investment’s financial performance and cash flow projections. Thus, financial assets and liabilities may be classified in Level3 even though there may be some s
ignificant inputs that may be observable.The following is a description o
f the valuation methodologies used for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, including thegeneral classific
ation of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.Cash and Cash Equivalents 
–  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Whenquoted prices are available i
n an active market, cash equivalents are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair values of cash equivalentinstruments that do not tr
ade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.Debt Securities
 –  Where quoted prices are available in an active market, debt securities are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. TheCompany’s Level 1 debt securit
ies consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities.The fair values of the Company
’s Level 2 debt securities are obtained using models, such as matrix pricing, which use quoted market prices of debtsecurities with simil
ar characteristics or discounted cash flows to estimate fair value. The134

Company reviews these prices to ensure they are based on observable market inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quotedprices for identica
l assets in inactive markets and inputs that are observable that are not prices (such as interest rates and credit risks). The Company alsoreviews the methodologies and 
the assumptions used to calculate prices from these observable inputs. On a quarterly basis, the Company selects a sampleof its Level 2 debt securi
ties’ prices and compares them to prices provided by a secondary source. Variances over a specified threshold are identified andreviewed to confirm the p
rice provided by the primary source represents an appropriate estimate of fair value. In addition, the Company’s internalinvestment team consistently
 compares the prices obtained for select Level 2 debt securities to the team’s own independent estimates of fair value forthose securities. The Company obt
ained one price for each of its Level 2 debt securities and did not adjust any of those prices at December 31, 2021 or2020.
The Company also values certa
in debt securities using Level 3 inputs. For Level 3 debt securities, fair values are determined by outside brokers or, in thecase of certain private placement 
securities, are priced internally. Outside brokers determine the value of these debt securities through a combination oftheir knowledge of the curr
ent pricing environment and market flows. The Company did not have any broker quoted debt securities for the years endedDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. For some privat
e placement securities, the Company’s internal staff determines the value of these debt securities byanalyzing spreads of corpor
ate and sector indices as well as interest spreads of comparable public bonds. Examples of these private placement Level 3debt securities include certain
 U.S. and foreign securities and certain tax-exempt municipal securities.Equity Securities
 –  The Company currently has two classifications of equity securities: those that are publicly traded and those that are privatelyplaced. Publicly-traded e
quity securities are classified in Level 1 because quoted prices are available for these securities in an active market. For privatelyplaced equity securities, t
here is no active market; therefore, these securities are classified in Level 3 because the Company prices these securities throughan internal analysis of 
each investment’s financial statements and cash flow projections. Significant unobservable inputs consist of earnings and revenuemultiples, discount for l
ack of marketability and comparability adjustments. An increase or decrease in any of these unobservable inputs would haveresulted in a change in
 the fair value measurement.135

Separate Accounts Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
Separate Accounts assets re
late to the Company’s large case pensions products which represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contractholders. Since contract hold
ers bear the investment risk of these assets, a corresponding Separate Accounts liability has been established equal to the assets. Theseassets and liabiliti
es are carried at fair value. Net investment income and capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets accrue directly to such contractholders. The assets of each a
ccount are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company’s other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals, netinvestment income and r
ealized and unrealized capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations,shareholders’ equity or c
ash flows.Separate Accounts assets inc
lude debt and equity securities. The valuation methodologies used for these assets are similar to the methodologies described above inthis Note 4 ‘‘Fair 
Value.’’ Separate Accounts assets also include investments in common/collective trusts that are carried at fair value. Common/collective trustsinvest in other investmen
t funds otherwise known as the underlying funds. The Separate Accounts’ interests in the common/collective trust funds are based on thefair values of the inves
tments of the underlying funds and therefore are classified in Level 2. The assets in the underlying funds primarily consist of equitysecurities. Investmen
ts in common/collective trust funds are valued at their respective net asset value (“NAV”) per share/unit on the valuation date.(1)(1)

$ 45,130 $ 23,615 $ 10,376 $ 79,121 During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2021, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge related to theLTC reporting unit within the Reta
il/LTC segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarilydriven by the divestiture o
f the Workers’ Compensation business, partially offset by goodwill associated with immaterial acquisitions. See Note 2 ‘‘Divestitures’’for further discussion reg
arding the Workers’ Compensation business divestiture.During the third quarter of 2021, 
the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated animpairment of the goodwil
l associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The resultsof the impairment tests of t
he remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date.During 2021, the LTC reporting unit has cont
inued to face challenges that have impacted the Company’s ability to grow the LTC reporting unit’s business at therate estimated when its 2
020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customerlosses and the prolonged adverse 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy ratesexperienced by the Company’s long
-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their2021 annual forecast and submi
tted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Companyutilized these updated p
rojections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carryingvalue, resulting in a $431 mi
llion goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using acombination of a discounted 
cash flow method and a market multiple method. As of December 31, 2021, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the LTCreporting unit. During the thi
rd quarter of 2021, the Company also performed an impairment test of the intangible assets of the LTC reporting unit and concludedthese assets were not impa
ired. As of December 31, 2021, there was $2.7 billion of intangible assets related to customer lists in the LTC reporting unit.(1)_____________________________________________

During the third quarter of 2020, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated that therewas no impairment of goodwill.

LeasesThe Company leases
 most of its retail stores and mail order facilities and certain distribution centers and corporate offices under operating or finance leases,typically with initia
l terms of 15 to 25 years. The Company also leases certain equipment and other assets under operating or finance leases, typically with initialterms of 3 to 10 years.
In addition, the Company leases ph
armacy space at the stores of another retail chain for which the noncancelable contractual term of the pharmacy leasearrangement exceeds the remainin
g estimated economic life of the buildings. For these pharmacy lease arrangements, the Company concluded that for accountingpurposes the lease term was 
the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings. Consequently, most of these individual pharmacy leases are finance leases.140

Sale-Leaseback Transactions
The Company finances a portion of 
its store development program through sale-leaseback transactions. The properties are generally sold at net book value, whichgenerally approximat
es fair value, and the resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. The operating leases that resulted from thesetransactions are inc
luded in the tables above. The Company does not have any retained or contingent interests in the stores and does not provide any guarantees,other than a

guarantee of lease payments, in connection with the sale-leaseback transactions. There were no sale-leaseback transactions in 2021. Proceeds from sale-leasebacktransactions totaled $101 
million and $5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gains from sale-leaseback transactions totaled $3million in the year end
ed December 31, 2020. There were no material gains from sale-leaseback transactions in the year ended December 31, 2019.Store Impairment Charges
The Company evaluates its re
tail store right-of-use and property and equipment assets for impairment at the retail store level, which is the lowest level at whichcash flows can be identifi
ed. For retail stores where there is an indicator of impairment present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset groupto the estimated futu
re cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used in the analysis are less thanthe carrying amount of t
he asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the assetgroup to its estimated f
air value which is the greater of the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted), or the consideration of what a market participantwould pay to lease the assets, ne
t of leasing costs. The Company’s estimate of fair value considers historical results, current operating trends, consolidated sales,profitability and cash 
flow results and forecasts. For assets which the Company has determined it will be able to sublease, the estimated future cash flows includethe estimated subleas
e income, net of estimated leasing costs.When the carrying value o
f an asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the value of the asset group to its estimated fairvalue. As the impaired asse
ts are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using unobservable inputs as of the measurement date, the assets areclassified in Level 3 of
 the fair value hierarchy.During the fourth quarter of 2021, 
the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores tocontinue to drive higher eng
agement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and futurehealth needs to ensure it h
as the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on November 17,2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corpora
tion (the “Board”) authorized the closing of approximately 900 retail stores over the next three years. TheCompany expects to close approxi
mately 300 stores each year between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators ofimpairment with respe
ct to the impacted stores’ asset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. A long-livedasset impairment test was 
performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store assetgroups was lower than their respe
ctive carrying values. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a store impairmentcharge of approximate
ly $1.4 billion, consisting of a write down of approximately $1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million relatedto property and equipment, with
in the Retail/LTC segment. Subsequent to the impairment loss, the fair value of the associated operating lease right-of use assetsand property and equipment wer
e $356 million and $185 million, respectively.During 2019, the Company performed rev
iews of its retail stores and determined it would close 68 underperforming retail pharmacy stores. As a result,management determined that there 
were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets.Long-lived asset impairment
 tests were performed and the results indicated that the fair value of those underperforming retail stores were lower than theirrespective carrying v
alues. Accordingly, the Company recorded store impairment charges of $231 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarilyrelated to these operating lea
se right-of-use asset impairment charges, within the Retail/LTC segment.143

7.Health Care Costs PayableThe following is information 
about incurred and cumulative paid health care claims development as of December 31, 2021, net of reinsurance, and the total IBNRliabilities plus expe
cted development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims amounts. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ forinformation on how the Company esti
mates IBNR reserves and health care costs payable as well as changes to those methodologies, if any. The Company’sestimate of IBNR liabili
ties is primarily based on trend and completion factors. Claim frequency is not used in the calculation of the Company’s liability. Inaddition, it is impracticable t
o disclose claim frequency information for health care claims due to the Company’s inability to gather consistent claim frequencyinformation across its 
multiple claims processing systems. Any claim frequency count disclosure would not be comparable across the Company’s different claimprocessing systems and would not be consis
tent from period to period based on the volume of claims processed through each system. As a result, health care claimcount frequency is not includ
ed in the disclosures below.The information about incu
rred and paid health care claims development for the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented as required unaudited supplementalinformation.

lidated balance sheets and (iii) $212 million, $221 million and $285 million, respectively, of benefit costs recorded in theCorporate/Other segment that are included in other insurance liabilit

ior years’ health care costs payable decreased by $788 million, $429 million and $524 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively,because claims were settled f
or amounts less than originally estimated (i.e., the amount of claims incurred was lower than originally estimated), primarily due tolower health care cost 
trends as well as the actual claim submission time being faster than originally assumed (i.e., the Company’s completion factors were higherthan originally assumed) 
in estimating health care costs payable at the end of the prior year. This development does not directly correspond to an increase in theCompany’s operating results as 
these reductions were offset by estimated current period health care costs when the Company established the estimate of the currentyear health care cos
ts payable.(1)_____________________________________________

The Company uses a series of actu
arial assumptions to determine its benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost (income), the most significant of which includediscount rates and expect
ed return on plan assets assumptions.Discount Rates
 -  The discount rate is determined using a yield curve as of the annual measurement date. The yield curve consists of a series of individualdiscount rates, with each dis
count rate corresponding to a single point in time, based on high-quality bonds. Projected benefit payments are discounted tothe measurement date using
 the corresponding rate from the yield curve that is consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows.Expected Return on Plan Assets
 -  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the plan’s target allocation and returnexpectations based on many f
actors including forecasted long-term capital market real returns and the inflationary outlook on a plan by plan basis. See“Pension Plan Assets” below for addition
al details regarding the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.The Company also considers other assu
mptions including mortality, interest crediting rate, termination and retirement rates and cost of living adjustments.The Company determined its ben

Pension Plan AssetsThe Company’s pension plan assets pri
marily include debt and equity securities held in separate accounts, common/collective trusts and real estate investments.The valuation methodologies us
ed to value these debt and equity securities and common/collective trusts are similar to the methodologies described in Note 4 “FairValue.” Pension plan assets also in
clude investments in other assets that are carried at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies usedto value real estat
e investments and these additional investments, including the general classification pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.Real Estate
 - Real estate investm ents are valued by independent third party appraisers. The appraisals comply with the Uniform Standards of ProfessionalAppraisal Practice, which in
clude, among other things, the income, cost, and sales comparison approaches to estimating property value. Therefore, theseinvestments are class
ified in Level 3.Private equity and hedge fund l
imited partnerships - Private equity and  hedge fund limited partnerships are carried at fair value which is estimated usingthe NAV per unit as reported by the ad
ministrator of the underlying investment fund as a practical expedient to fair value. Therefore, these investmentshave been excluded from
 the fair value table below.Pension plan assets with changes in f

The Company’s pension plan invests in a diversified mix of assets designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future benefit obligations. Therisk of unexpected investm
ent and actuarial outcomes is regularly evaluated. This evaluation is performed through forecasting and assessing ranges of investmentoutcomes over short- and long-
term horizons and by assessing the pension plan’s liability characteristics. Complementary investment styles and strategies areutilized by professional
 investment management firms to further improve portfolio and operational risk characteristics. Public and private equity investments areused primarily to increase 
overall plan returns. Real estate investments are viewed favorably for their diversification benefits and above-average dividendgeneration. Fixed inc
ome investments provide diversification benefits and liability hedging attributes that are desirable, especially in falling interest rateenvironments.
At December 31, 2021, target inves
tment allocations for the Company’s pension plan were: 12% in equity securities, 77% in fixed income and debt securities, 5%in real estate, 3% in p
rivate equity limited partnerships and 3% in hedge funds. Actual asset allocations may differ from target allocations due to tactical decisionsto overweight or underweight ce
rtain assets or as a result of normal fluctuations in asset values. Asset allocations are consistent with stated investment policies and,as a general rule, periodicall
y rebalanced back to target asset allocations. Asset allocations and investment performance are formally reviewed periodicallythroughout the year by the pension p
lan’s Investment Subcommittee. Forecasting of asset and liability growth is performed at least annually.Cash Flows
The Company generally contribu
tes to its tax-qualified pension plan based on minimum funding requirements determined under applicable federal laws andregulations. Employer cont
ributions related to the nonqualified supplemental pension plans generally represent payments to retirees for current benefits. TheCompany contributed $78 million, $25 
million and $25 million to its pension plans during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No contributions are required for thetax-qualified pension pl
an in 2022. The Company expects to make an immaterial amount of contributions for all other pension plans in 2022.The Company estimates the fo
llowing future benefit payments, which are calculated using the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the pension benefitobligation as of December 31, 2021:

1,776 Multiemployer Pension Plans
The Company also contributes to a nu
mber of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-representedemployees. The risks of part
icipating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following respects: (i) assets contributedto the multiemployer p
lan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer stopscontributing to the plan, th
e unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if the Company chooses to stopparticipating in some o
f its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the applicableplan, which is referred to 
as a withdrawal liability.None of the multiemployer p
ension plans in which the Company participates are individually significant to the Company. The Company’s contributions tomultiemployer pension pl
ans were $19 million, $19 million and $18 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company provides postretire
ment health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees who meet eligibility requirements. The Company’s funding policyis generally to pay cover
ed expenses as they are incurred. For retiree medical plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends forhealth care costs to de
termine the health care cost trend rates. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s other postretirement benefits had an accumulatedpostretirement bene
fit obligation of $207 million and $226 million, respectively. Net periodic benefit costs related to these other postretirement benefits were $4million, $12 million and $7 m
illion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.153

$ 782 $ 768 $ 655 CVS Health Corporation and most of its subsidi
aries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of numerous state and local jurisdictions. CVSHealth Corporation partic
ipated in the Compliance Assurance Process through 2019, which is a program made available by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service(“IRS”) to certain qual
ifying large taxpayers, under which participants work collaboratively with the IRS to identify and resolve potential tax issues through open,cooperative and transpa
rent interaction prior to the annual filing of their federal income tax returns. The IRS has completed its examinations of the Company’sconsolidated U.S. federal inco
me tax returns for tax years through and including 2013 and 2018. The IRS has substantially completed its examinations of theCompany’s consolidated U.S. federal 
income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2017 and 2019.155

CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries are also currently under income tax examinations by a number of state and local tax authorities. As of December 31,2021, no examination has result
ed in any proposed adjustments that would result in a material change to the Company’s operating results, financial condition orliquidity.
Substantially all mat
erial state and local income tax matters have been concluded for fiscal years through 2014. Certain state exams are likely to be concluded andcertain state sta
tutes of limitations will lapse in 2022, but the change in the balance of the Company’s uncertain tax positions is projected to be immaterial. Inaddition, it is reasonably poss
ible that the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits could change within the next twelve months due to the anticipated conclusion ofvarious examinations with th
e IRS for various years. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time.The Company records interest 
expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in the income tax provision. The Company accrued interest expense ofapproximately $40 mill
ion, $34 million and $49 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company had approximately $151 million and $121 millionaccrued for interes
t and penalties as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.As of December 31, 2021, the total a
mount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate is approximately$669 million, after con
sidering the federal benefit of state income taxes.11.
Stock Incentive PlansThe terms of the CVS Health 2017 Incent
ive Compensation Plan (“ICP”) provide for grants of annual incentive and long-term performance awards to executiveofficers and other off
icers and employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, as well as equity compensation to outside directors of CVS HealthCorporation. Payment of such annual 
incentive and long-term performance awards will be in cash, stock, other awards or other property, at the discretion of theManagement Planning and Developm
ent Committee (the “MP&D Committee”) of the Board. The ICP allows for a maximum of 58 million shares of CVS HealthCorporation common stock to be r
eserved and available for grants. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 30 million shares of CVS HealthCorporation common stock avai
lable for future grants under the ICP.Upon the acquisition of Aetna (th
e “Aetna Acquisition”) on November 28, 2018, approximately 22 million shares of Aetna common stock subject to awardsoutstanding under the Amended Aetna 
Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (“SIP”) were assumed by CVS Health Corporation. In addition, in accordance with themerger agreement, sh
ares which were available for future issuance under the SIP were converted into approximately 32 million shares of CVS Health Corporationcommon stock reserved and av
ailable for issuance pursuant to future awards. Subsequent to the expiration of the SIP on May 21, 2020, the ICP is the onlycompensation plan under which th
e Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to its employees.Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation is m
easured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of thestock award (generally 
three  to five years) using the st raight-line method. The following table is a summary of stock-based compensation for the years endedDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:

Includes the ESPP. ESPP
The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
(“ESPP”) provides for the purchase of up to 60 million shares of CVS Health Corporation common stock. Underthe ESPP, eligible employees may pu
rchase common stock at the end of each six month offering period at a purchase price equal to 90% of the lower of the fairmarket value on the fi
rst day or the last day of the offering period. During 2021, approximately 3 million shares of common stock were purchased under theprovisions of the ESPP at an average pr
ice of $60.51 per share. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 31 million shares of common stock were available forissuance under the ESPP.

The fair value of stock-based compensation associated with the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant (the first day of the six month offering period) using theBlack-Scholes option pricing mod
el.The following table is a summ

The dividend yield is calculated based on semi-annual dividends pa id and the fair market value of CVS Health Corporation stock at the grant date.(2)
The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of CVS Health Corporation’s daily stock price over the previous six month period.(3)
The risk-free interest rate is selected based on the Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent wi th the expected term of ESPP purchases (i.e., six months).(4)
The expected life is based on the semi-annual purchase period. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
The Company’s restricted sto
ck units and performance stock units are considered nonvested share awards and require no payment from the employee. The fairvalue of the restric
ted stock units is based on the market price of CVS Health Corporation common stock on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basisover the vesting period. For ea
ch restricted stock unit granted, employees receive one share of common stock, net of taxes, at the end of the vesting period.The Company’s performance sto
ck units contain performance vesting conditions in addition to a service vesting condition. Vesting of the Company’s performancestock units is dependent upon the deg
ree to which the Company achieves its performance goals, which are generally set for a three-year performance period and areapproved at the time of g
rant by the MP&D Committee.The fair value of perfo
rmance stock units granted with service and performance vesting conditions is based on the market price of CVS Health Corporationcommon stock on the grant dat
e and is recognized over the vesting period. Certain of the performance stock units also contain a market vesting condition based onthe performance of CVS Health Corpor
ation common stock relative to a comparator group. The fair value of these performance stock units is determined using aMonte Carlo simulation as of 
the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period.As of December 31, 2021, there was $529 mil
lion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock units and performance stockunits that are expect
ed to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The total fair value of restricted stock unitsvested during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $406 million, $229 m

the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiatedtransactions, accel
erated share repurchase (“ASR”) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. The 2021 Repurchase Program can be modified or terminatedby the Board at any time.
During the years ended Decembe
r 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to the 2016 or 2021Repurchase Programs.
Pursuant to the authorizat
ion under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC(“Barclays”). Upon payment of 
the $1.5 billion purchase price on January 4, 2022, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’scommon stock equal to 80% of th
e $1.5 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 11.6 million shares at a price of $103.34 per share, which wereplaced into treasury sto
ck in January 2022. At the conclusion of the ASR, the Company may receive additional shares equal to the remaining 20% of the$1.5 billion notional amount. The u
ltimate number of shares the Company may receive will depend on the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’sstock over an averaging per
iod, less a discount. It is also possible, depending on such weighted average price, that the Company will have an obligation to Barclayswhich, at the Company’s option, could be s
ettled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASR, the maximum number of shares that could bedelivered to the Company is 29.0 m

The quarterly cash dividend d
eclared by the Board was $0.50 per share in 2021 and 2020. In December 2021, the Board authorized a 10% increase in the quarterlycash dividend to $0.55 per share e
ffective in 2022. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Futuredividend payments will depend on th
e Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board.Regulatory Requirements

ed using the two-class method. SARs and options to purchase 7 million, 15 million, and 17 million shares of common stock wereoutstanding, but were excluded f
rom the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, becausetheir exercise prices were greater
 than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.The following is a reconcil

ReinsuranceThe Company utilizes
 reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance contracts.Ceded reinsurance agree
ments permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s primaryliability as the direct insurer
 of the risks reinsured.On November 30, 2018, the Company completed th
e sale of Aetna’s standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to a subsidiary of WellCare Health Plans,Inc. (“WellCare”), 
effective December 31, 2018. In connection with that sale, subsidiaries of WellCare and Aetna entered into reinsurance agreements under whichWellCare ceded to Aetna 100
% of the insurance risk related to the divested standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans for the 2019 PDP plan year.In January 2022, the Company entered 
into two four-year reinsurance agreements with an unrelated reinsurer that allow it to reduce required capital and providecollateralized 
excess of loss reinsurance coverage on a portion of the Health Care Benefits segment’s group Commercial Insured business.Reinsurance recoverabl
es (recorded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets) at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:In millions

any entered into these contracts to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss which in turn reduces the Company’s capital andsurplus requirements. Tota
l deposit assets and liabilities related to reinsurance agreements that do not qualify for reinsurance accounting under GAAP were notmaterial as of Dece
mber 31, 2021 or 2020.16.
Commitments and ContingenciesCOVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Th
e Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financialcondition primarily wil
l be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and globaleconomies and consumer behav
ior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state andlocal governmental r
esponses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 willhave on the Company’s businesses, opera
ting results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-19also may result in lega
l and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.Guarantees
The Company has the following signifi
cant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2021:•
ASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The banksmaintain accounts to fund 
claims of the Company’s ASC customers. The customer is responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day. In thesearrangements, the Company gua
rantees that the banks will not sustain losses if the responsible ASC customer does not properly fund its account. Theaggregate maximum exposu
re under these arrangements is generally limited to $250 million. The Company can limit its exposure to these guarantees bysuspending the payment of cla
ims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded the amount paid by the bank.•
Separate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent fundsmaintained as a contr
actual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations underlying theguaranteed benefits in 
these Separate Accounts were approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 1‘‘Significant Accounting Poli
cies’’ for additional information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and mortality risk and arerequired to maintain Sep
arate Accounts balances at or above a specified level. The level of required funds is a function of the risk underlying the SeparateAccount’s investment stra
tegy. If contract holders do not maintain the required level of Separate Accounts assets to meet the annuity guarantees, the Companywould
163

establish an additional liability. Contract holders’ balances in the Separate Accounts at December 31, 2021 exceeded the value of the guaranteed benefitobligation. As a result, the Company was no
t required to maintain any additional liability for its related guarantees at December 31, 2021.Lease Guarantees
Between 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a numb
er of subsidiaries, including Bob’s Stores and Linens ‘n Things, each of which subsequently filedfor bankruptcy, and Marshalls. 
In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the former subsidiary’s leaseobligations for the init
ial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. When thesubsidiaries were disposed of and 
accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company’s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser agreed toindemnify the Company for any l
ease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries fail to make therequired payments under a s
tore lease, the Company could be required to satisfy those obligations, and any significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on suchpurchasers and/or forme
r subsidiaries increases the risk that the Company will be required to satisfy those obligations. As of December 31, 2021, the Companyguaranteed 72 such store le
ases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens ‘n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the consolidated balancesheets), with the maximum 
remaining lease term extending through 2030.Guaranty Fund Assessments, Market Stabilization and Other Non-Voluntary Risk Sharing Pools
Under guaranty fund laws existing in 
all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (in most states up to prescribed limits) for certain obligationsof insolvent insurance comp
anies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the Company participates thatoperate under these laws r
espond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers and life insurers as well as health insurers. The Company’s assessments generally arebased on a formula rela
ting to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers. Certain states allow assessments to berecovered over time 
as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors such as not-for-profit consumer-governedhealth plans established und
er the ACA.In 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Com
missioner placed long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries(collectively, “Penn Tr
eaty”) in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and subsequently petitioned a state court to convert the rehabilitation into aliquidation. Penn Treaty was pla
ced in liquidation in March 2017. The Company has recorded a liability for its estimated share of future assessments by applicablelife and health insuran
ce guaranty associations. It is reasonably possible that in the future the Company may record a liability and expense relating to otherinsolvencies which could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows, and the risk is heightened by anysignificant adverse i
mpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the solvency of other insurers, including long-term care and life insurers. While historically theCompany has ultimately re
covered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets, significant increases inassessments could lead to l
egislative and/or regulatory actions that limit future offsets.HMOs in certain states in which th
e Company does business are subject to assessments, including market stabilization and other risk-sharing pools, for which theCompany is assessed charges based on in
curred claims, demographic membership mix and other factors. The Company establishes liabilities for these assessmentsbased on applicable laws and r
egulations. In certain states, the ultimate assessments the Company pays are dependent upon the Company’s experience relative toother entities subject to t
he assessment, and the ultimate liability is not known at the financial statement date. While the ultimate amount of the assessment isdependent upon the experienc
e of all pool participants, the Company believes it has adequate reserves to cover such assessments.The Company’s total guaranty fund 
assessments liability was immaterial at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings
The Company has been involved or is cur
rently involved in numerous legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration, government investigations, audits,reviews and claims. These in
clude routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, the U.S. Department of Justice (the 
“DOJ”), state attorneys gener al, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) and other governmental authorities.Legal proceedings, in gener
al, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, and governmental special investigations, audits and reviews canbe expensive and disruptive. Some o
f the litigation matters may purport or be determined164

to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved forseveral years. The Company also 
may be named from time to time in qui tam  actions initiated by pr ivate third parties that could also be separately pursued by agovernmental body. The results o
f legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred inthese matters can be subs
tantial, regardless of the outcome.The Company records accruals 
for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.The Company evaluates, on a quart
erly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a losscontingency both probable and r
easonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish anaccrued liability. None o
f the Company’s accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company’s financial condition.Except as otherwise noted, the Comp
any cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, and the Company is unable toreasonably estimate 
a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for these matters. The Company believes that its defenses andassertions in pending legal p
roceedings have merit and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights toindemnification, will h
ave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings, however, dosometimes occur, which could 
result in judgments against the Company, entry into settlements or a revision to its expectations regarding the outcome of certainmatters, and such developm
ents could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations orproceedings, the Company may be subj
ect to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions including possible suspension or loss of licensureand/or exclusion from par
ticipating in government programs. The outcome of such governmental investigations of proceedings could be material to the Company.Usual and Customary Pricing Litiga
tionThe Company and certain curr
ent and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company’s retailpharmacies overcharg
ed for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process. These actions arebrought by a number of differ
ent types of plaintiffs, including plan members, private payors, government payors, and shareholders based on different legal theories.Some of these cases are brough
t as putative class actions, and in some instances, classes have been certified. The Company is defending itself against these claims.PBM Litigation and Investigations
The Company is named as a defendan
t in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its PBM practices.The Company is facing multipl
e lawsuits, including by a State Attorney General, governmental subdivisions and several putative class actions, regarding drugpricing and its rebate 
arrangements with drug manufacturers. These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legaltheories, generally a
llege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products. The Company isdefending itself agains
t these claims. The Company has also received subpoenas, civil investigative demands (“CIDs”) and other requests for documents andinformation from, and is b
eing investigated by, Attorneys General of multiple states and the District of Columbia regarding its PBM practices, including pricingand rebates. The Company has been prov
iding documents and information in response to these subpoenas, CIDs and requests for information.United States ex rel. Behnke 
v. CVS Caremark Corporation, et al. (U.S. District Court for th e Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In April 2018, the Court unsealed acomplaint filed in Febru
ary 2014. The government has declined to intervene in this case. The relator alleges that the Company submitted, or caused to besubmitted, to Part D of the Medi
care program Prescription Drug Event data and/or Direct and Indirect Remuneration reports that misrepresented true prices paid bythe Company’s PBM to pharmacies for d
rugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company’s PBM. The Company isdefending itself agains
t these claims.165

Controlled Substances Litigation, Audits and SubpoenasIn December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Pane
l on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by plaintiffs such as counties,cities, hospitals, Indian 
tribes and third-party payors, alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread prescription opioid abuse. The consolidatedmultidistrict li
tigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ofOhio. This multidistrict l
itigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases that name the Company as a defendant. A significant number ofsimilar cases that n
ame the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state courts. In addition, the Company has been named as a defendant insimilar cases brought by c
ertain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against all such claims. Additionally, the Company has receivedsubpoenas, CIDs and/or other requests fo
r information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General and insurance and other regulators of several U.S.jurisdictions. The Company has been 
cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas, CIDs and other requests for information. In November2021, the Company was among the chain phar
macies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; the remedy pursuant to that verdict has not beendetermined and the Company pl
ans to appeal.In January 2020, the DOJ served the Company with a DEA adm
inistrative subpoena. The subpoena seeks documents relating to practices with respect toprescription opioids and othe
r controlled substances at CVS Pharmacy locations concerning potential violations of the federal Controlled Substances Act and thefederal False Claims Act. 
In January 2022, the DOJ served the Company with a CID regarding similar subjects. The Company is providing documents andinformation in response to 
these matters.Prescription Processing Litig
ation and InvestigationsThe Company is named as a defendan
t in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its prescription processing practices,including the following:
U.S. 
ex rel.  Bassan  et al.  v. Omnicare, Inc. and CVS Health Corp. (U.S. District Court for the Southern Dist rict of New York). In December 2019, the U.S.Attorney’s Office for the South
ern District of New York (the “SDNY”) filed a complaint-in-intervention in this previously sealed qui tam  case. The complaint alleges that for ce
rtain non-skilled nursing facilities, Omnicare improperly filled prescriptions beyond one year where a valid prescription did not exist and thatthese dispensing events viola
ted the federal False Claims Act. The Company is defending itself against these claims.In July 2017, the Company also receiv
ed a subpoena from the California Department of Insurance requesting documents concerning the Company’s Omnicarepharmacies’ cycle 
fill process for assisted living facilities. The Company has been cooperating with the California Department of Insurance and providingdocuments and information 
in response to this subpoena.In December 2016, the Company rec
eived a CID from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of New York requesting documents and information inconnection with a federa
l False Claims Act investigation concerning whether the Company’s retail pharmacies improperly submitted certain insulin claims to PartD of the Medicare program 
rather than Part B of the Medicare program. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents andinformation in response to 
this CID.Provider Proceedings
The Company is named as a defendan
t in purported class actions and individual lawsuits arising out of its practices related to the payment of claims for servicesrendered to its membe
rs by providers with whom the Company has a contract and with whom the Company does not have a contract (“out-of-networkproviders”). Among other things, th
ese lawsuits allege that the Company paid too little to its health plan members and/or providers for out-of-network servicesand/or otherwise allege 
that the Company failed to timely or appropriately pay or administer out-of-network claims and benefits (including the Company’s postpayment audit and colle
ction practices and reductions in payments to providers due to sequestration). Other major health insurers are the subject of similarlitigation or have settled 
similar litigation.The Company also has received subpoen
as and/or requests for documents and other information from, and been investigated by, state Attorneys General and otherstate and/or federa
l regulators, legislators and agencies relating to, and the Company is involved in other litigation regarding, its out-of-network benefit paymentand administration pra
ctices. It is reasonably possible that others could initiate additional litigation or additional regulatory action against the Company withrespect to its out-of-net
work benefit payment and/or administration practices.166

CMS ActionsCMS regularly audits the Company’s pe
rformance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and to assess the quality ofservices it provides to Med
icare beneficiaries. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate and adjust premium payments to the Company’s and othercompanies’ Medicare p
lans by considering the applicable health status of Medicare members as supported by information prepared, maintained and provided byproviders. The Company collects 
claim and encounter data from providers and generally relies on providers to appropriately code their submissions to theCompany and document their med
ical records, including the diagnosis data submitted to the Company with claims. CMS pays increased premiums to MedicareAdvantage plans and Medicare PDP plans fo
r members who have certain medical conditions identified with specific diagnosis codes. Federal regulators review andaudit the providers’ medical
 records to determine whether those records support the related diagnosis codes that determine the members’ health status and theresulting risk-adjusted p
remium payments to the Company. In that regard, CMS has instituted risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”) audits of variousMedicare Advantage plans, in
cluding certain of the Company’s plans, to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained byproviders and the resulting 
risk adjusted premium payments to the plans. CMS may require the Company to refund premium payments if the Company’s riskadjusted premiums are no
t properly supported by medical record data. The Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the “OIG”) also is auditing the Company’srisk adjustment-rel
ated data and that of other companies. The Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue these types of audits.In 2012, CMS revised its audit methodology 
for RADV audits to determine refunds payable by Medicare Advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward.Under the revised methodology, a
mong other things, CMS will extrapolate the error rate identified in the audit sample of approximately 200 members to all riskadjusted premium paymen
ts made under the contract being audited. For contract years prior to 2011, CMS did not extrapolate sample error rates to the entirecontract. As a result, the 
revised methodology may increase the Company’s exposure to premium refunds to CMS based on incomplete medical records maintainedby providers. Since 2013, CMS has selected c
ertain of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contracts for various contract years for RADV audit, and the number ofRADV audits continues to increase. The Company 
is currently unable to predict which of its Medicare Advantage contracts will be selected for future audit, theamounts of any retroact
ive refunds of, or prospective adjustments to, Medicare Advantage premium payments made to the Company, the effect of any such refundsor adjustments on the actu
arial soundness of the Company’s Medicare Advantage bids, or whether any RADV audit findings would require the Company to changeits method of estimat
ing future premium revenue in future bid submissions to CMS or compromise premium assumptions made in the Company’s bids for priorcontract years, the cu
rrent contract year or future contract years. Any premium or fee refunds or adjustments resulting from regulatory audits, whether as a result ofRADV, Public Exchange related or other aud
its by CMS, the OIG or otherwise, including audits of the Company’s MLR rebates, methodology and/or reports,could be material and 
could adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.Medicare and Medicaid CIDs
The Company has received CIDs from th
e Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with a current investigation of the Company’s patient chart review processes inconnection with risk adjustm
ent data submissions under Parts C and D of the Medicare program. The Company has been cooperating with the government andproviding documents and inform
ation in response to these CIDs.In May 2017, the Company received a CID f
rom the SDNY requesting documents and information concerning possible false claims submitted to Medicare inconnection with reimburse
ments for prescription drugs under the Medicare Part D program. The Company has been cooperating with the government andproviding documents and inform
ation in response to this CID.Stockholder Matters
Beginning in February 2019, multiple 
class action complaints, as well as a derivative complaint, were filed by putative plaintiffs against the Company and certaincurrent and former officers an
d directors. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action under federal securities laws that are premised onallegations that the d
efendants made certain omissions and misrepresentations relating to the performance of the Company’s LTC business unit. The Company andits current and forme
r officers and directors are defending themselves against these claims. Since filing, several of the cases have been consolidated, and the first-filed federal case, 
City of Miami Fire Fighters’ and Pol ice Officers’ Retirement Trust, et al. (formerly known as Anarkat ), was dismissed with prejudice inFebruary 2021. Plaintiffs have app
ealed that decision to the First Circuit after their motion for reconsideration was denied. In re CVS Health Corp. Securities Act Litigation
 (formerly known as Waterford ) and In 167

re CVS Health Corp. Securities Litigation (formerly known as City of Warren  and Freundlich ) have been stayed pending the ou tcome of the First Circuit appeal.In August and September 2020, two class ac
tions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) were filed in the U.S. District Court forthe District of Connecticu
t against CVS Health, Aetna, and several current and former executives, directors and/or members of Aetna’s Compensation and TalentManagement Committee: 
Radcliffe v. Aetna Inc., et al.  and Flaim v. Aetna Inc., et al. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action premised onallegations that the d
efendants breached fiduciary duties and engaged in prohibited transactions relating to participants in the Aetna 401(k) Plan’s investment incompany stock between Decembe
r 3, 2017 and February 20, 2019, claiming losses related to the performance of the Company’s LTC business unit. The districtcourt consolidated the a
ctions and the Company is defending itself against these claims. In October 2021, the consolidated case was dismissed without prejudice.Plaintiffs may seek le
ave to file an amended complaint. The Company also received a related document request pursuant to ERISA § 104(b), to which theCompany has responded.
In December 2021, the Company rec
eived a demand for inspection of books and records pursuant to Delaware Corporation Law Section 220 (the “Demand”). TheDemand purports to be relat
ed to potential breaches of fiduciary duties by the Board in relation to certain matters concerning opioids.Other Legal and Regulatory Proce
edingsThe Company is also a party to othe
r legal proceedings and is subject to government investigations, inquiries and audits and has received and is cooperating withthe government in response to CIDs, subpoen
as or similar process from various governmental agencies requesting information. These other legal proceedings andgovernment actions includ
e claims of or relating to bad faith, medical or professional malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, claims processing, dispensing ofmedications, non-compliance
 with state and federal regulatory regimes, marketing misconduct, denial of or failure to timely or appropriately pay or administerclaims and benefits, prov
ider network structure (including the use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), rescission of insurancecoverage, improper disclo
sure or use of personal information, anticompetitive practices, general contractual matters, product liability, intellectual propertylitigation and employm
ent litigation. Some of these other legal proceedings are or are purported to be class actions or derivative claims. The Company is defendingitself against the claims bro
ught in these matters.Awards to the Company and others of cer
tain government contracts, particularly Medicaid contracts and other contracts with government customers in theCompany’s Health Care Benefits seg
ment, frequently are subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders. These protests may result in awards to the Company beingreversed, delayed or modi
fied. The loss or delay in implementation of any government contract could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. TheCompany will continue to defend con
tract awards it receives.There also continues to be a h
eightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities and legislators of, and increased litigation regarding, the Company’sand the rest of the healt
h care and related benefits industry’s business and reporting practices, including premium rate increases, utilization management,development and applica
tion of medical policies, complaint, grievance and appeal processing, information privacy, provider network structure (including providernetwork adequacy, t
he use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), provider directory accuracy, calculation of minimum medicalloss ratios and/or payment o
f related rebates, delegated arrangements, rescission of insurance coverage, limited benefit health products, student health products,pharmacy benefit management practice
s (including manufacturers’ rebates, pricing, the use of narrow networks and the placement of drugs in formulary tiers),sales practices, custo
mer service practices, vendor oversight and claim payment practices (including payments to out-of-network providers).As a leading national heal
th solutions company, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. These governmentactions may prevent or de
lay the Company from implementing planned premium rate increases and may result, and have resulted, in restrictions on the Company’sbusinesses, changes to or clar
ifications of the Company’s business practices, retroactive adjustments to premiums, refunds or other payments to members,beneficiaries, sta
tes or the federal government, withholding of premium payments to the Company by government agencies, assessments of damages, civil orcriminal fines or pen
alties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation ingovernment programs.
The Company can give no assurance th
at its businesses, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected, or that theCompany will not be required to m
aterially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) theinterpretation or app
lication of existing laws or168

regulations as they may relate to one or more of the Company’s businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health careindustry generally; (i
ii) pending or future federal or state government investigations of one or more of the Company’s businesses, one or more of the industries inwhich the Company competes and/or 
the health care industry generally; (iv) pending or future government audits, investigations or enforcement actions against theCompany; (v) adverse developm
ents in any pending qui tam  lawsuit against the Company, whethe r sealed or unsealed, or in any future qui tam  lawsuit that may be filed against the Company; o
r (vi) adverse developments in pending or future legal proceedings against the Company or affecting one or more of the industries inwhich the Company competes and/or 
the health care industry generally.17.
Segment ReportingThe Company has three operating s
egments, Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company’ssegments maintain sepa
rate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on aregular basis in deciding how to 
allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of theCompany’s segments based on adjusted op
erating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization ofintangible assets and othe
r items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying businessperformance. See the r
econciliation of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income below for further contextregarding the items ex
cluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principalmeasure of segment performance
 as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlyingbusiness performance and t
rends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considereda substitute for, or superio
r to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.In 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenues from the f
ederal government accounted for 17%, 16% and 16%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total revenues,primarily relat
ed to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.169

Total revenues of the Pharmacy Services segment include approximately $11.6 billion, $10.9 billion and $11.5 billion of retail co-payments for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information about retail co-payments.

Intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Health Care Benefits segment, the Pharmacy Services segment, and/or theRetail/LTC segment. Intersegment adjusted operating 
income eliminations occur when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients (“PSS members”) enrolled in Maintenance Choiceelect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company’s retail pharmac
ies instead of receiving them through the mail. When this occurs, both the Pharmacy Services andRetail/LTC segments record the adjusted operating income on a s
tand-alone basis.(1)(2) _____________________________________________

The Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks,customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, techno
logy, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimateduseful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may no
t be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s GAAPconsolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segmen
t. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangibleassets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or
services. Additionally, intangible asset amortizat
ion expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believesexcluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the 
Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and toanalyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the
Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has no
t been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible assetamortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike 
the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless anintangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful 
life of an intangible asset is revised.(2)
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, acquisition-related integration costs relate to the Aetna Acquisition. The acquisition-related integration costs are reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidatedstatements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment.
(3)
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the store impairment charge relates to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with theplanned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the store impairment charges related to the write down of operating
lease right-of-use assets in connection with the planned closure of 68 underperforming retail pharmacy stores in 2019 and 2020. The store impairment charges are reflected in the Company’s
GAAP consolidated statements of operations within the Retail/LT
C segment.(4)
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the goodwill impairment charge relates to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment.(5)
In June 2021, the Company received $61 million related to a purchase price working capital adjustment for an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2020. The resolution of thismatter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected 
in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2021 as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment.
(6)
In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately$850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in 
the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefitssegment. In 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the
elimination of the cumulative translat
ion adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income and is reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations inoperating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment.
(7)
In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the ACA’s risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsettingitems such as the ACA’s minimum MLR rebate requirements and premium taxes, 
the Company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statementof operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.

We have audited CVS Health Corporation
’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,CVS Health Corporation (the Company) main
tained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based onthe COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidatedfinancial statem
ents of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over
 financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to expressan
 opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and arerequired
 to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PC
AOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective inter
nal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe
 design and operating  effectiveness  of internal  control based on the assessed risk, and performing  such other procedures  as we considered  necessary  in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financia
l ReportingA
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting
 includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of CVS Health CorporationOpinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the relatedconsolidated statemen
ts of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2021, and the related
 notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of thethree years in the per
iod ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 9, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
These financial
 statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased
 on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonableassurance
 about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess
 the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures
 included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting
 principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The
 critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe
 communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging,
 subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financialstatements,
 taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on theaccounts or disclosures to which 
they relate.173

Annual goodwill impairment test of the Commercial Business reporting unitDescription of the
Matter
At December 31, 2021, the Company’s goodwill related to the Commercial Business reporting unit was $26.5 billion. As discussed inNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an annual impairment review, or more
frequent reviews, if eve
nts and circumstances indicate an impairment exists.Auditing
 management's annual goodwill impairment test related to the Commercial Business reporting unit was complex and highlyjudgmental
 due  to  the  significant  estimation  required  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit.  In  particular,  the  fair  valueestimate
 was  sensitive  to  changes  in  significant  assumptions,  such  as  the  discount  rate,  projected  revenue  and  projected  operatingincome that are forwa
rd-looking and affected by future economic and market conditions.How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  Company’s  annualgoodwill impairment rev
iew process, including controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above. To
 test the estimated fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others,assessing
 methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in itsanalysis.
 We compared the significant assumptions to the reporting unit’s historical results and third-party industry data. We performedsensitivity
 analyses  of  significant  assumptions  to evaluate  the  changes  in the fair  value  of the reporting  unit that  would result  fromchanges
 in  the  key  assumptions.  We  involved  valuation  specialists  to  assist  in  our  assessment  of  the  methodology  and  significantassumptions (such as the discount rate) used by the Company. In addition
, we tested management’s reconciliation of the fair value of allreporting units to the ma
rket capitalization of the Company.Valuation of health care costs payable
Description of the
Matter 
At December 31, 2021, the incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) liabilities represented $6.6 billion of $8.8 billion of health care costspayable.
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s liability for health care costs payable includesestimated
 payments for (1) services rendered to members but not yet reported and (2) claims that have been reported but not yet paid,each
 as of the financial statement date (collectively, “IBNR”). The estimated IBNR liability is developed utilizing actuarial principlesand
 assumptions that include historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, historical and assumed medical costtrends,
 historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in membership and product mix, seasonality and otherrelevant factors to record the
 actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determiningmanagement’s
 actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. In particular, the estimate is sensitive to the assumed completionfactors and the assumed
 health care cost trend rates.Auditing
 management’s actuarial best estimate of IBNR reserves for health care costs payable for its products and services involved ahigh degree of subjectivi
ty in evaluating management’s assumptions used in the valuation process.How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process for estimatingIBNR
 reserves. This included, among others, controls over the completeness and accuracy of data used in the actuarial projections, thetransfer
 of  data  between  underlying  source  systems,  and  the  review  and  approval  processes  that  management  has  in  place  for  theactuarial princip
les and assumptions used in estimating the health care costs payable.To test
 IBNR reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claim andmembership
 data used in the calculation of IBNR reserves. We involved actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures, whichincluded,
 among  others,  evaluating  the  methodologies  applied  by  the  Company  in  determining  the  actuarially  determined  liability,evaluating
 management’s  actuarial  principles  and  assumptions  used  in  their  analysis  based  on  historical  claim  experience,  andindependently calculating
 a range of reserve estimates for comparison to management’s actuarial best estimate of the liability for healthcare
 costs payable. Additionally, we performed a review of the prior period liabilities for incurred but not paid claims to subsequentclaims development.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
The Company’s Chief Executive Offi
cer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosurecontrols and procedures (as d
efined in Rules 13a-15 (f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2021, have concluded that asof such date the Company’s disclosu
re controls and procedures were adequate and effective at a reasonable assurance level and designed to ensure that materialinformation relat
ing to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to such officers on a timely basis.Management’s report on internal control ov
er financial reportingManagement is responsi
ble for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s interna l control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the Company; (2) p rovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of theCompany’s consolidated financ
ial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company arebeing made only in accordan
ce with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention ortimely detection of un
authorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financialstatements. In order to 
ensure the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such control and did so mostrecently for its fin
ancial reporting as of December 31, 2021.Management conducted an ass
essment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). This evaluation includedreview of the documentat
ion, evaluation of the design effectiveness and testing of the operating effectiveness of controls. The Company’ s system of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by the Company’s internal auditors, written policies and procedures and a written Code of Conductadopted by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Dire
ctors, applicable to all employees of the Company. In addition, the Company has an internal DisclosureCommittee, comprised of 
management from each functional area within the Company, which performs a separate review of disclosure controls and procedures.There are inherent limitations i
n the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting.Based on management’s assessm
ent, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonableassurance that assets a
re safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements as of December 31, 2021.Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent reg
istered public accounting firm, is appointed by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors and ratified byCVS Health Corporation’s stockholders. They wer

Certain Statutory and Charter ProvisionsCertain provisions of the Chart
er and By-Laws summarized in the following paragraphs may be deemed to have an antitakeover effect and may delay, deferor prevent a tender offer 
or takeover attempt.Potential Issuances of Preferred Stock and Prefer
ence StockAs of February 9, 2022, the Charter author
ized 120,619 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share and 50,000,000 shares of preference stock, parvalue $1.00 per share. The Charte
r also authorizes the board to issue shares of preferred stock or preference stock, from time to time, in such class or classes, andsuch series within any class, and wi
th such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations orrestrictions thereo
f as the board may determine, including, for example, (i) the designation of the class or series; (ii) the number of shares of the class or series,which number the board may the
reafter (except where otherwise provided in the designation of any subsequently authorized class or series) increase or decrease(but not below the number of shar
es thereof then outstanding); (iii) whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or noncumulative and the dividend rate of theclass or series; (iv) 
the dates on which dividends, if any, will be payable; (v) the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the class or series;(vi) the terms and amoun
ts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of shares of the class or series; (vii) the amounts payable on shares of theclass or series in the ev
ent of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of CVS Health; (viii) whether the shares of the classor series will be convert

ll other terms and conditions upon which such conversion may be made; (ix) restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same class orseries or of any other cl
ass or series; and (x) the voting rights, if any, of the holders of such class or series. The authorized capital stock of CVS Health, includingpreferred stock, pref
erence stock and common stock, will be available for issuance without further action by CVS Health stockholders, unless such action isrequired by applicable 
law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which CVS Health’s securities may be listed or traded. If theapproval of CVS Health stockholders is not so 
required, the board does not intend to seek stockholder approval.Although the board has no intention a
t the present time of doing so, it could issue a class or series of preferred stock or preference stock that could,depending on the terms of such c
lass or series, impede completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt that the holders of some, or a majority, ofCVS Health shares might believe to b
e in their best interests or in which CVS Health stockholders might receive a premium for their shares over the then-currentmarket price of such sha
res.Potential Issuances of Rights to Purchase Securities
CVS Health does not currently have a sto
ckholder rights plan, although the board retains the right to adopt a new plan at a future date. The Charter grantsthe board exclusive author
ity to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase from CVS Health shares of capital stock or other securities and toelect to repurchase, 
redeem, terminate or amend any such rights. The times at which and terms upon which such rights are to be issued, repurchased, redeemed,terminated or amend
