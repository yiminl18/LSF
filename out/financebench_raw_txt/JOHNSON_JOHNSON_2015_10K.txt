PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the "Company") have approximately 127,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and
development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, which has more than
250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical
and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating
companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business
segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located.
Segments of Business
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this
item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: Item 7 “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Consumer
The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s
health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSON’S® line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE® product line. Major brands in
Skin Care include the AVEENO®; CLEAN & CLEAR®; DABAO™; JOHNSON’S® Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS®; LUBRIDERM®;

Care brands include the BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN® First Aid product lines. These products are marketed to the general
public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.
Pharmaceutical
The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas: immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and
psoriasis), infectious diseases and vaccines (e.g., HIV, hepatitis, respiratory infections and tuberculosis), neuroscience (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, mood
disorders and schizophrenia), oncology (e.g., prostate cancer, hematologic malignancies and lung cancer), and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (e.g.,
thrombosis and diabetes). Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription
use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE® (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory
diseases; SIMPONI® (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active
ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with

injection), for the treatment of
                
 1
                                
schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; VELCADE® (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma and for use in
combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell

prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce
the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and
PE; INVOKANA® (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET®/VOKANAMET® (canagliflozin/metformin HCl),
a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Many of these
medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development
programs.
Medical Devices
The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care
fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals,
eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and energy products; electrophysiology
products to treat cardiovascular disease; sterilization and disinfection products to reduce surgical infection; diabetes care products, such as blood glucose
monitoring and insulin delivery products; and disposable contact lenses.
Geographic Areas
The business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the U.S., in virtually all
countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of
Business – Consumer,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the
international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the United States and by
subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment
and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system
uncertainties.
Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the
temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
Patents
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are
licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance
to the Company in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Company’s largest product, REMICADE® (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.4%
of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2015. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company.
There are two sets of patents related specifically to REMICADE® (infliximab). The first set of patents is co-owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU). Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to NYU's
interests in the patents. These patents have expired in all countries outside the United States. In the United States, the latest of these patents expires in
September 2018 and this patent stands rejected and is subject to reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the United States Patent and
Trademark Office. Those proceedings are on going.
The second set of patents specifically related to REMICADE® was granted to The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in Europe, Canada,
Australia and the United States. Janssen Biotech, Inc. has licenses (exclusive for human anti-TNF antibodies and semi-exclusive for non-human anti-TNF
antibodies) to these patents that expire in 2017 outside of the United
                
 2
                                
States and 2018 in the United States. The validity of these patents has been challenged. Certain claims have been invalidated and others are under review in
various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in Canada.
The Company does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to
REMICADE®. If any of the REMICADE® related patents discussed above is found to be invalid, any such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the
introduction of biosimilar versions of REMICADE®. For a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE®, see
Note 21 “Legal Proceedings – Intellectual Property – Pharmaceutical – REMICADE® Related Cases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this Report.
In addition to competing in the immunology market with REMICADE®, the Company is currently marketing STELARA® (ustekinumab),
SIMPONI® (golimumab) and SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to eight years.
Trademarks
The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by
all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. The
Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
Seasonality
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.
Competition
In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines
without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the
development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative
products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of
its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of
customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Research and Development
Research activities represent a significant part of the Company’s businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of
discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior
to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products.
Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $9.0 billion, $8.5 billion and $8.2 billion for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Research facilities are located in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands,
Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
Environment
The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations
comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change
during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
Regulation
The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the
general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by
various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation
required for
                
 3
                                
FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major
markets outside of the U.S.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and
legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write
prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market
place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of
health care generally.
U.S. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "ACA").
These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA
will ultimately affect the industry.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product
withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls.
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government
agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing
regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to
lengthy regulatory approvals.

In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, the Company maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the
world. Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Report under “Business – Research and Development.”
The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S. locations, are leased.
Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers.
The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized.
McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the
FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the "Consent Decree"). The Fort Washington facility was
voluntarily shut down in April 2010, and subsequently many products were transferred to other manufacturing sites and successfully reintroduced to the
market. After McNEIL-PPC successfully completed all requirements contained in the Consent Decree Workplans for the Lancaster and Las Piedras
manufacturing sites and completed the steps required for third-party certification of the Fort Washington plant, a third-party cGMP expert submitted written
certifications to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all
three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations. Commercial production in Fort Washington started as of September
2015.
Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three
facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times for
at least five years. A discussion of legal proceedings related to this matter can be found in Note 21 “Legal Proceedings – Government Proceedings –
McNeil Consumer Healthcare” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 16 “Rental Expense and Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Segment information on additions to property, plant and equipment is contained in Note 18 “Segments of

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Organization and Business Segments
Description of the Company and Business Segments
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 127,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad
range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are
marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five
therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment
are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad
range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and
retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business
segments.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product
lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as
protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for
the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Management’s Objectives
The Company manages within a strategic framework with Our Credo as the foundation. The Company believes that our strategic operating principles:
being broadly based in human health care, managing the business for the long term, having a decentralized management approach, and being committed to
our people and values, are crucial to successfully meeting the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete. To this end, management is
focused on our long-term strategic growth drivers: creating value through innovation, expanding our global reach with a local focus, excellence in
execution and leading with purpose.
The Company is broadly based in human health care, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products
and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2015 sales. In 2015, $9.0 billion, or 12.9% of sales,
was invested in research and development, reflecting management’s commitment to delivering new and differentiated products and services to meet
evolving health care needs and sustain the Company’s long-term growth.
Our diverse businesses with more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries are the key drivers of the Company’s success. Maintaining the
Company’s decentralized management approach, while at the same time leveraging the extensive resources of the enterprise, positions the Company well to
innovate, execute strategic plans and reach markets globally, as well as address the needs and challenges of the local markets.
In order to remain a leader in health care, the Company strives to maintain a purpose-driven organization and is committed to developing global
business leaders who can achieve these growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long-term in order to sustain market leadership positions and
enable growth, which provides an enduring source of value to our shareholders.
Our Credo unifies all Johnson & Johnson employees in achieving these objectives, and provides a common set of values that serve as the foundation of
the Company’s responsibilities to patients, consumers and health care professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes that
these foundational values, its strategic framework and long-term growth drivers, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people
around the world, will enable Johnson & Johnson to continue to be a leader in the health care industry.

Results of Operations
Analysis of Consolidated Sales
In 2015, worldwide sales decreased 5.7% to $70.1 billion, compared to increases of 4.2% in 2014 and 6.1% in 2013. These sales changes consisted of the
following:
Sales increase/(decrease) due to:  2015  2014  2013
Volume  1.2 % 6.3 7.6
Price  0.6  (0.2) 0.1
Currency  (7.5) (1.9) (1.6)
Total  (5.7)% 4.2 6.1
In 2015, the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir),
had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide operational sales growth. In 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide operational
sales growth was negative 2.0%.
In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 2.8%,
and the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide operational growth. In 2013, the acquisition
of Synthes, Inc., net of the related divestiture, increased worldwide operational growth by 2.5%.
Sales by U.S. companies were $35.7 billion in 2015, $34.8 billion in 2014 and $31.9 billion in 2013. This represents increases of 2.6% in 2015, 9.0%
in 2014 and 7.0% in 2013. Sales by international companies were $34.4 billion in 2015, $39.5 billion in 2014 and $39.4 billion in 2013. This represents a
decrease of 13.1% in 2015, and increases of 0.4% in 2014 and 5.4% in 2013.
The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.6%, 3.9% and 1.4%, respectively. The ten-year
compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 2.3% and 4.5%, respectively.
Sales by companies in Europe experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.1%, offset by a
negative currency impact of 16.7%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to
the prior year, including operational growth of 2.6% offset by a negative currency impact of 18.2%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region
experienced a decline of 8.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 0.3% and a negative currency impact of 8.4%.
2015 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). The
Company estimated that the fiscal year 2015 growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also
added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.
In 2015 and 2014, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% and 11.0%,
respectively, of the total consolidated revenues. In 2013, the Company did not have a customer that represented 10% or more of total consolidated
revenues.
U.S. Health Care Reform
On July 28, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations for the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, an annual non-tax deductible fee
imposed on entities engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs (covered entities), enacted by Section 9008 of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year, from the
year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur. This change impacted covered entities and resulted in the need for
all entities to record an additional expense in 2014 for the fee that would have otherwise been expensed when paid in 2015. The Company accrued an
additional $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014 due to this change. The fee associated with this accelerated expense was paid, as scheduled, in
2015 and had no cash impact in 2014.

Total Consumer Sales  $ 13,507 14,496 14,697 (6.8)% (1.4)
The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.0 billion decreased 3.2% as compared to the prior year, which included 8.1% operational growth
and a negative currency impact of 11.3%. Operational growth was primarily driven by analgesics, upper respiratory, including ZYRTEC®, and digestive
health products.
McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations and requires McNEIL-PPC to
remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Fort Washington, Pennsylvania; and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the Consent Decree). In
February 2015, a third-party expert submitted written certification to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. Following FDA inspections in 2015,
McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations. Under the
Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a
five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times for at least five years. 
The Skin Care franchise sales of $3.5 billion decreased 6.0% as compared to the prior year, which included 1.3% operational growth and a negative
currency impact of 7.3%. Operational growth was primarily due to sales growth of NEUTROGENA® and AVEENO® products partially offset by lower
sales in China.
The Baby Care franchise sales were $2.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the prior year, which included 1.2% operational growth and a
negative currency impact of 9.9%. Operational growth was primarily due to new product launches partially offset by competition in China.
The Oral Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.1% as compared to the prior year, which included 5.2% operational growth and
a negative currency impact of 9.3%. Operational growth was driven by increased sales of LISTERINE® products, attributable to geographical expansion of
new products and successful marketing campaigns.
The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included 7.6% operational
growth and a negative currency impact of 15.4%. Operational growth outside the U.S. was driven by new product launches and successful marketing
campaigns.
The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $1.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 18.5% from 2014, primarily due to the SPLENDA® and BENECOL®
divestitures.
Consumer segment sales in 2014 were $14.5 billion, a decrease of 1.4% from 2013, which included 1.0% operational growth offset by a negative
currency impact of 2.4%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 1.3%. International sales were $9.4 billion, a decrease of 1.4%,
which included 2.3% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 3.7%.

Pharmaceutical Segment
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2015 were $31.4 billion, a decrease of 2.7% from 2014, which included operational growth of 4.2% offset by a negative
currency impact of 6.9%. U.S. sales were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.2%. International sales were $13.1 billion, a decrease of 12.0%, which included
3.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 15.0%. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 6.5%
due to the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), and
positively impacted by 1.4% due to an adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates primarily in the
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic area. In 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 0.3% on the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment
operational growth.

Immunology products achieved sales of $10.4 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Immunology products
growth of 2.1% included operational growth of 6.9% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%. The increased sales of STELARA® (ustekinumab) and
SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) were due to market growth and increased penetration of SIMPONI ARIA®. Growth was partially offset by
lower REMICADE® (infliximab) sales to the Company's distributor primarily due to the weakening of the euro and biosimilar competition in Europe. The
patents for REMICADE® in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain
markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets.
                
 12
                                
Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States.  The timing of the
possible introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the FDA and
compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA). On February 9, 2016, the Arthritis
Advisory Committee of the FDA recommended by a vote of 21-3 to approve the first investigational biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications in
the United States. There is a risk that a competitor could launch a biosimilar version of REMICADE® following FDA approval (subject to compliance with
the 180-day notice provisions of the BPCIA), even though one or more valid patents are in place. Introduction to the U.S. market of a biosimilar version of
REMICADE® will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®.  In 2015, U.S. sales of REMICADE® were $4.5 billion. The launch of a biosimilar
version of REMICADE® in the U.S. is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows in 2016. See
Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents.
Infectious disease products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 34.7% from 2014, which included an operational decrease of 27.6% and a negative
currency impact of 7.1%. Competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had
a significant negative impact on U.S. sales and will continue to have a negative impact on future sales. The decline of Hepatitis C sales was partially offset
by sales growth of EDURANT®(rilpivirine) and sales of PREZISTA®/ PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® (darunavir/cobicistat).
Neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion, a decrease of 3.5% from 2014, which included an operational growth of 5.0% and a negative currency
impact of 8.5%. The U.S. sales growth of CONCERTA®/methylphenidate was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic
competitors by the FDA in November 2014. Strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/INVEGA TRINZA® (paliperidone palmitate) were
primarily due to increased market share and the launch of INVEGA TRINZA®. Neuroscience products sales were negatively impacted by the U.S.
divestiture of NUCYNTA® (tapentadol) and lower sales of RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone).
Oncology products achieved sales of $4.7 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 5.3% as compared to the prior year. Oncology products growth of
5.3% included operational growth of 17.7% and a negative currency impact of 12.4%. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of IMBRUVICA®
(ibrutinib) due to the approval of new indications, additional country launches and strong patient uptake. Additionally, sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone
acetate) grew in the U.S. due to market growth partially offset by share decline, and strong growth in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by lower
sales in Europe due to competition.
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products achieved sales of $6.4 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 15.1% as compared to the prior year due
to strong sales of XARELTO®(rivaroxaban) and INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin). PROCRIT®/EPREX® (Epoetin alfa) sales were impacted
by competition.

The Pharmaceutical segment achieved sales of $32.3 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 14.9% over the prior year, with strong operational
growth of 16.5% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%. U.S. sales were $17.4 billion, an increase of 25.0%. International sales were $14.9 billion, an
increase of 5.0%, which included 8.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 3.3%. In 2013, Pharmaceutical segment sales included a
positive adjustment to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates. This negatively impacted 2014 Pharmaceutical operational sales growth by 0.8%
as compared to the prior year. In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a
positive impact of 6.9% on the operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment.

Medical Devices Segment
The Medical Devices segment sales in 2015 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 8.7% from 2014, which included an operational decline of 1.4% and a
negative currency impact of 7.3%. U.S. sales were $12.1 billion, a decrease of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.0 billion, a
decrease of 14.8% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 13.1%. The divestitures of the
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics and the Cordis Businesses had a negative impact of 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively, on the worldwide operational growth of the
Medical Devices segment as compared to 2014.

The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.3% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative
currency impact of 6.0%. Operational growth in the U.S. and Europe regions was primarily driven by sales of the hip primary stem platform, the
ATTUNE® Knee System, trauma TFNA nailing system and sports medicine ORTHOVISC®/MONOVISC® products. Growth was negatively impacted by
softer demand and a reduction in customer inventory levels primarily in China and continued pricing pressures.
The Surgery franchise sales were $9.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 5.1% from 2014, which included operational growth of 2.7% and a negative
currency impact of 7.8%. Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was driven by endocutter, biosurgical and energy products, primarily attributable to
market growth, increased penetration in certain markets and new product launches. Operational growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by
Mentor products. Growth was partially offset by lower sales of women's health and urology products in General Surgery.
The Vision Care franchise sales were $2.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.5% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative
currency impact of 9.2%. Operational growth in all the major regions was primarily driven by new product launches partially offset by lower price.
The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.0 billion, a decrease of 7.8% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.1% and a negative
currency impact of 7.7%. Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by market growth and the success of the
THERMOCOOL® SMARTTOUCH® Catheter and was offset by the impact of divesting the Cordis business. The Company completed the divestiture of
the Cordis business to Cardinal Health on October 4, 2015. The Cordis business generated annual net revenues of approximately $535 million and $780
million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 10.0% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.7% and a negative
currency impact of 9.3%. The operational decline was primarily due to lower price partially offset by the success of the ANIMAS® VIBE® products.
On June 30, 2014, the Company divested the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business (the Diagnostics Franchise) to The Carlyle Group. For additional
details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Medical Devices segment sales in 2014 were $27.5 billion, a decrease of 3.4% from 2013, which included an operational decline of 1.6% and a
negative currency impact of 1.8%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, a decrease of 4.3% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $15.3 billion, a
decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, with operational growth of 0.5% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.2%. In 2014, the divestiture of the
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 3.2% on the operational growth of the Medical Devices segment.
Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $19.2 billion as compared to $20.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of 6.6%. The
decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), negative currency impacts, a restructuring charge of
$0.6 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was partially offset by lower net litigation
expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion, a positive adjustment of $0.4 billion to previous reserve estimates including
Managed Medicaid rebates, and higher gains of $0.3 billion from divestitures as compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of
$0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA® brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® versus the gains recorded
in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y® brand. Additionally, 2014 included an additional year of the Branded
Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion.
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $20.6 billion in 2014 as compared to $15.5 billion in 2013, an increase of
32.9%. Earnings before provision for taxes on income were favorable due to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD®
(simeprevir), positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the Pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost
reduction efforts across many of the businesses. Additionally, 2014 included higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion, lower in-process research and development costs of $0.4 billion and lower
expenses of $0.1 billion related to the DePuy ASR™ Hip program as compared to the fiscal year 2013. This was partially offset by the inclusion of an
additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion of higher Synthes integration/transaction costs in 2014. The fiscal year
2013 included a net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares. 
As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2015 was 27.4% versus 27.7% in 2014.
Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses:  Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses
as a percent to sales were as follows:
% of Sales  2015  2014  2013
Cost of products sold  30.7% 30.6 31.3
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  0.1 (0.7) (0.9)
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses  30.3% 29.5 30.6
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  0.8 (1.1) (0.4)
In 2015, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Favorable mix between the segments was offset by $81
million associated with the restructuring activity in the Medical Devices segment, negative transactional currency and lower sales of
OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) in 2015. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 billion
and $1.4 billion, respectively. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to the prior
year, primarily due to incremental investment spending in all the segments and the impact from lower sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir),
partially offset by favorable mix and the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion in 2014.
In 2014, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased compared to the prior year. This was primarily the result of positive mix from higher sales
of higher margin products in the Pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost improvements across many of the businesses.
This was partially offset by pricing and the impact of negative transactional currency. In addition, 2013 included an inventory step-up charge of $0.1 billion
related to the Synthes acquisition. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for both 2014 and 2013 was $1.4 billion. There
was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to leveraged costs
resulting from growth in the Pharmaceutical business, particularly sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), and cost containment initiatives across
many of the businesses. This was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $220 million in the fiscal
third quarter of 2014.

Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering,
testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory
compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and
innovative products. In 2015, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 6.5% compared to 2014. The increase as a percent to
sales was attributable to increased investment spending primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment, lower overall sales and business mix. In 2014, worldwide
costs of research and development activities increased by 3.8% compared to 2013. The reduction as a percent to sales was primarily due to strong sales
growth in the Pharmaceutical business. Research spending in the Pharmaceutical segment increased in absolute dollars to $6.2 billion as compared to $5.8
billion primarily due to higher levels of spending to advance the Company's Pharmaceutical pipeline.
In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2015, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of
certain development projects related to Covagen. In 2014, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion for the impairment of various IPR&D
projects related to RespiVert, Crucell, Mentor and Synthes for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. In 2013, the Company recorded
an IPR&D charge of $0.6 billion primarily for the impairment of various IPR&D projects related to Crucell, CorImmun and Acclarent for the delay or
discontinuation of certain development projects.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down
of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (formerly Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation),
gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty
income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2015 was a favorable change of $2.0 billion as compared to the prior year primarily
due to lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion and higher JJDC portfolio gains of $0.2 billion as compared
to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the
SPLENDA® brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics
business and the K-Y® brand. This was partially offset by higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015.
The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2014 was a favorable change of $2.6 billion as compared to the prior year. The fiscal year
2014 included higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business, lower litigation expense
of $1.0 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the DePuy ASR™ Hip program as compared to 2013. This was partially offset by higher Synthes
integration/transaction costs of $0.2 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion primarily related to INCIVO® (telaprevir) in 2014.
Additionally, the fiscal year 2013 included a higher net gain of $0.5 billion as compared to 2014 on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of
Elan American Depositary Shares.
Interest (Income) Expense:  Interest income in 2015 increased by $61 million as compared to 2014 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $38.4 billion at the end of 2015,
and averaged $35.7 billion as compared to the $31.1 billion average cash balance in 2014. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to
cash generated from operating activities.
Interest expense in 2015 increased slightly as compared to 2014. The average debt balance was $19.3 billion in 2015 versus $18.5 billion in 2014. The
total debt balance at the end of 2015 was $19.9 billion as compared to $18.8 billion at the end of 2014. The higher debt balance of approximately $1.1
billion was an increase in commercial paper for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program.
Interest income in 2014 was comparable to the prior year. A higher balance in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was offset by lower
interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $33.1 billion at the end of
                
 17
                                
2014, and averaged $31.1 billion as compared to the $25.2 billion average cash balance in 2013. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily
due to cash generated from operating activities.
Interest expense in 2014 increased by $51 million as compared to 2013 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was
$18.5 billion in 2014 versus $17.2 billion in 2013. The total debt balance at the end of 2014 was $18.8 billion as compared to $18.2 billion at the end of
2013. The higher debt balance of approximately $0.6 billion was due to increased borrowings in November 2014. The Company increased borrowings,
capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes.
Income Before Tax by Segment
Income before tax by segment of business were as follows:

(1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.
(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense, noncontrolling interests, and general corporate (income) expense.
Consumer Segment: In 2015, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.2%, versus 13.4% in 2014, primarily due to lower
divestiture gains in 2015 versus 2014. In 2015, the Consumer segment tax included a gain of $0.3 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the
SPLENDA® brand. In 2014, the Consumer segment included a gain of $0.5 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the K-Y® brand. In 2014,
the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.4%, flat to the prior year.
Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2015, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 37.3% versus 36.2% in 2014. The favorable
income before tax was primarily due to higher gains recognized in 2015 partially offset by a sales decline of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD®(simeprevir), increased
investment spending and negative currency impacts as compared to 2014. Included in 2015 was a gain of $1.0 billion on the U.S. divestiture of
NUCYNTA®, as well as receipt of a contingent payment and a positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates.
Additionally, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax in 2014 was negatively impacted by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded
Prescription Drug Fee and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.3 billion primarily related to the write-down of INCIVO® (telaprevir).
In 2014, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 36.2% versus 32.6% in 2013. The favorable income before tax was
attributable to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), positive sales mix of higher margin products and cost
containment initiatives realized in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the
Branded Prescription Drug Fee and a $0.1 billion intangible asset write-down related to INCIVO® (telaprevir). Additionally, 2013 included a net gain of
$0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares, and a positive adjustment of $0.2 billion to previous
estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates, partially offset by higher write-downs of $0.4 billion for the impairment of IPR&D as compared to 2014.
Medical Devices Segment: In 2015, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 27.2% versus 28.9% in 2014 primarily due
to a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion, an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent, and lower gains of $0.5 billion on divestitures
as compared to 2014. In 2015, the Medical Devices segment included gains of $1.4 billion, primarily for the divestiture of the Cordis business versus a gain
of $1.9 billion recorded in 2014 for the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business. The 2015 income before tax was favorably impacted by
lower net litigation expense of $0.9 billion, which included a gain from the litigation settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with Guidant, and lower Synthes
integration costs of $0.6 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014.

In 2014, Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.9% versus 18.5% in 2013. The favorable income before tax was
attributable to the net gain of $1.9 billion on the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business in 2014 and lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion
as compared to 2013.
Restructuring: The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment that are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings
of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018, including approximately $200 million savings in 2016.
The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for
customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion
to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by 2017. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6
billion, of which $81 million is included in cost of products sold. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the
restructuring.
Provision for Taxes on Income:  The worldwide effective income tax rate was 19.7% in 2015, 20.6% in 2014 and 10.6% in 2013. The 2015 effective tax
rate decrease of 0.9% as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax
jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items
mentioned below.
The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics
business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S.,
the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned
increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year. These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by
a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture.
The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals court’s
decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code (see Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Company’s U.S. Internal
Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009.
The 2013 effective tax rate was reduced by a tax benefit associated with the write-off of assets for tax purposes associated with Scios, Inc., and the
inclusion of both the 2013 and 2012 benefit from the Research and Development tax credit and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through
provisions, because those provisions were enacted into law in January 2013 and were retroactive to January 1, 2012.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity & Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents were $13.7 billion at the end of 2015 as compared to $14.5 billion at the end of 2014. The primary sources and uses of cash that
contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $19.3 billion of cash generated from operating activities offset by $7.7 billion net cash used by
investing activities, and $10.8 billion net cash used by financing activities, and $1.5 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash
equivalents. In addition, the Company had $24.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2015 and $18.6 billion at the end of 2014. See Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Cash flow from operations of $19.3 billion was the result of $15.4 billion of net earnings and $5.4 billion of non-cash charges and other adjustments
for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, primarily related to Acclarent and Venezuela write-downs, reduced
by $2.6 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, and $1.2 billion related to deferred taxes, accounts receivable and inventories. Additional
sources of operating cash flow of $2.2 billion resulted from a decrease in other current and non-current assets and an increase in other current and non-
current liabilities.
Investing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for net purchases of investments in marketable securities of $6.7 billion, additions to property,
plant and equipment of $3.5 billion, and acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $3.5 billion of proceeds from the disposal of
assets/businesses.
Financing activities use of $10.8 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.2 billion and $5.3 billion for the repurchase of common
stock. Financing activities also included a source of $1.4 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.3 billion of net proceeds from stock
options exercised and associated tax benefits.
On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase
up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of January 3, 2016, $1.0 billion has been repurchased under the program. The repurchase
program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate
purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash and access to the capital markets. The previous share
repurchase program approved on July 21, 2014, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock, was
completed on April 28, 2015.
                
 19
                                
In 2015, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. The Company has a shelf registration with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that enables the Company to issue debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities on a timely basis. For
additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide sufficient resources to fund
operating needs in 2016.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and
adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have
impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net
trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016 and $1.8 billion as of December
28, 2014. Approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 and approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2014 of the Southern European Region net
trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and
Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns.
The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments
from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local
affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016 and $0.7 billion at
December 28, 2014. The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers
where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time
for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to
work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary.
Financing and Market Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into
forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions
primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of
the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2016 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $15 million. Conversely,
a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2016 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by
$18 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore,
would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by
entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $115 million. In either scenario, at
maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on
future anticipated cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into
contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is
no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of
fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if
interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the
unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $314 million.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2015, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 15, 2016. Interest charged on borrowings
under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable
margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
Total borrowings at the end of 2015 and 2014 were $19.9 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2015 and 2014
was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program. In 2015, net cash
                
 20
                                
(cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $18.5 billion compared to net cash of $14.3 billion in 2014. Total debt represented 21.8% of total
capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2015 and 21.2% of total capital in 2014. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2015 was $25.82
compared to $25.06 at year-end 2014, an increase of 3.0%.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy
these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate
maturities as of January 3, 2016 (see Notes 7, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):

For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Dividends
The Company increased its dividend in 2015 for the 53rd consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $2.95 per share in 2015 compared with dividends of
$2.76 per share in 2014, and $2.59 per share in 2013. The dividends were distributed as follows:
 2015  2014  2013
First quarter $ 0.70 0.66 0.61
Second quarter 0.75 0.70 0.66
Third quarter 0.75 0.70 0.66
Fourth quarter 0.75 0.70 0.66
Total $ 2.95 2.76 2.59
On January 4, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share, payable on March 8, 2016, to shareholders of
record as of February 23, 2016. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.
Other Information
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires
that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures.
Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates
are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue
recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for
pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.
Revenue Recognition:  The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the
customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as
reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.
                
 21
                                
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical
experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for
products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as
internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices
segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing
promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical
redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are
recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were
less than 1% of total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be
deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative
partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative fair value. Upfront fees received as part of
these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
disclosures on collaborations.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect
on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a
material financial statement impact.

Income Taxes:  Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between
U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $58.0 billion and
$53.4 billion, respectively. At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, the Company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities in the amounts of $38.2 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed
earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. The Company intends to continue to
reinvest these earnings in international operations. If the Company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be
required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed
earnings, as such determination is not practical.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies:  The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability
claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals
in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Additionally, the Company records insurance receivable amounts from third-party insurers when recovery is probable. As appropriate, reserves against
these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable
and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
                
 24
                                
See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets:  The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash
flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may
change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans:  The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination
indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,
mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.
Stock Based Compensation:  The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their
services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a
combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the
service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.
For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant.  The fair values for the sales and
earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the
award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period.  The fair value for the relative total
shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements
not yet adopted as of January 3, 2016.
Economic and Market Factors
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have
expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products
responsibly. For the period 2005 - 2015, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for
health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to
monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way
companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate
surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity
improvements and periodic price increases.
The Venezuelan government has established alternative systems and offerings of various foreign currency exchanges. During 2015, the Company
primarily utilized the official government rate of 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes to one U.S. Dollar in preparing its consolidated financial statements. During 2014,
the Company applied to settle an outstanding dividend payable at one of the alternative foreign exchange rates. As a result, the Company has applied this
alternative exchange rate to translate certain transactions, as appropriate. Through the fourth quarter of 2015, the number of the Company’s transactions
conducted at the official rate declined from prior quarters. As a result, the Company determined that it was no longer likely that all outstanding net
monetary assets would be settled at the official government rate of 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes to one U.S. Dollar. Therefore, the Company recorded a charge of
$161 million to revalue its net monetary assets in Venezuela at one of the government’s alternative exchange rates (SIMADI) and impair its non-monetary
assets. After the revaluation, as of January 3, 2016, the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiaries represented less than 0.1% of the Company's consolidated
assets and liabilities. Due to continuing uncertain economic conditions in Venezuela, it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future.
Any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s 2016 full year results.
While the Company continues to do business in Greece, the Company closely monitors the economic situation. As of January 3, 2016, the Company’s
Greek subsidiaries represented 0.3% and 0.4% of the Company's consolidated assets and revenues, respectively.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies
in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2015 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately
$340 million and income by $90 million.
                
 25
                                
The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment
and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing
prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global
economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.
The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug
Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents,
seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering
those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar
versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could
launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further
information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial
and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue
and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and
other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the
possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of
judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be
affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has
not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are
numerous parties involved.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate
results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,”
“expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations,
financial performance, the Company’s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement
will be accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying
assumptions prove inaccurate or that known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the Company’s
expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company does not
undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; competition,
including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges and uncertainties inherent in new product development,
including uncertainty of clinical success and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success of new and existing products; challenges to
patents; the impact of patent expirations; the ability of the company to successfully execute strategic plans, including restructuring plans; the potential that
the expected benefits and opportunities related to the restructuring may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; significant adverse
litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; impact of business combinations and divestitures; market conditions and the
possibility that the on-going share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued; significant changes in customer relationships or changes in
behavior and spending patterns or financial distress of purchasers of health care products and services; changes to applicable laws and regulations,
including global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost containment; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies;
financial instability of international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; manufacturing difficulties or delays, internally or within the supply
chain; complex global supply chains with increasing regulatory requirements; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory
action; disruptions due to natural disasters; and the potential failure to meet obligations in compliance agreements with government bodies.
A discussion of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in this Report for the fiscal
year ended January 3, 2016, including in Exhibit 99. The Company notes these factors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated.
Description of the Company And Business Segments
The Company has approximately 127,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of
products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to
human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad
range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are
marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five
therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment
are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad
range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and
retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-04: Practical
Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer’s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets. This update provides a practical expedient option to
entities that have defined benefit plans and have a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a calendar month-end. This option allows an entity to elect to
measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the calendar month-end that is closest to its fiscal year-end. This update will be effective for the
Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and if the practical expedient is elected by an entity, it is required to be
adopted on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt the practical expedient to measure its defined benefit plans.
This election did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-17 Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
Taxes. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as
noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This update is required to be effective for all public Companies for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt this standard
on a retrospective basis. The 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet reclassification reduced current assets by $3.6 billion, increased non-current assets by $2.8
billion and reduced liabilities by $0.8 billion.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Not Adopted as of January 3, 2016
During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-01: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different
categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through
net income. The standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entity’s equity investments and reducing the number of
items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its
financial statements.
During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-03: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
This update requires capitalized debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction to the carrying value of debt instead of being classified as a deferred
charge, as currently required. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is
required to be applied retroactively for all periods presented. This update will not have a material impact on the presentation of the Company’s financial
position.

During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-11: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This update
requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of
the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This update will not have a material impact on the presentation of the Company’s financial position.
During the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-16 Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for
Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified
during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This update will be effective for the Company for
all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to
provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.
This update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
During the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard
replaces substantially all current revenue recognition accounting guidance. During the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral
to the effective date to be adopted by all public companies for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
adoption of this standard is permitted but not before the original effective date for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements.
During the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10: Development Stage Entities:
Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entity Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.  The
change in the current guidance will require the Company to determine if it should consolidate one of these entities based on the change in the consolidation
analysis.  This update to the consolidation analysis will become effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2015.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
During the fiscal third quarter of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard requires management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions
and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the
financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. If substantial doubt is raised, additional disclosures around management’s plan to alleviate
these doubts are required. This update will become effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016.  This
standard is not expected to have any impact on current disclosures in the financial statements.
Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly
liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy
of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in
reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs), government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities and money market funds.
RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of ‘Government Securities and Obligations’ for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The
Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that
the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that
collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date
of purchase are classified as marketable securities.
                
 36
                                
Investments
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments
classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet
date. The Company periodically reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline
in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. If losses on these securities are considered to be other than temporary, the loss is recognized in
earnings.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years
Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
generally range from 3 to 8 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or
economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is
determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not
available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for
certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same
period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include Medicaid, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient
outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups
of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated
information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return
patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales returns accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices
segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual sales to customers during the fiscal reporting years 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing
promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical
redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are
recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and includes it in sales to customers. These
arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.
                
 37
                                
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $996 million, $1,068 million and $1,128 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in
selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all
periods presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first-in, first-out method.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The
Company completed the annual impairment test for 2015 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth
quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying
project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the
intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by
economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
Financial Instruments
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1
having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for
undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the
Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness
of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial
Instruments.
Product Liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted
periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when
those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated.
As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. The
Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed
the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on the availability of prior coverage,
receivables for insurance recoveries related to product liability claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be
realized. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and
adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have
impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net
trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016 and approximately $1.8 billion as
of December 28, 2014. Approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 and approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2014 of the Southern
European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain
Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns.
The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from
certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates.
The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers
                
 38
                                
were approximately $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016 and $0.7 billion at December 28, 2014. The Company continues to receive payments from these
customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and
trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these
customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic
situation and take appropriate actions as necessary.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and
development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory
approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other
intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize
drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are
exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by
one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and
royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due
from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the
performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these
collaborations is as follows:
Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation
Third-party sale of product  Sales to customers
Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory
approval)*  Cost of products sold
Royalties received from collaborative partner  Other income (expense), net
Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-
regulatory approval)  Research and development expense
Research and development payments to collaborative partner  Research and development expense
Research and development payments received from collaborative partner Reduction of Research and development expense
* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of goods sold over the useful life.
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.
The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO®, co-developed with
Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA®, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.
 
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively.
                
 39
                                
Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP
accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax
regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $58.0 billion and
$53.4 billion, respectively. At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, the Company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities in the amounts of $38.2 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed
earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. The Company intends to continue to
reinvest these earnings in international operations. If the Company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be
required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed
earnings, as such determination is not practical.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Net Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common
stock using the treasury stock method.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives,
product liabilities, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results
may or may not differ from those estimates.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and
can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
Annual Closing Date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year
consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, as was the case in 2015, and will be the case again in 2020.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Fair value of government securities and obligations and corporate debt securities were estimated using quoted broker prices and significant other
observable inputs.
The contractual maturities of substantially all available for sale securities are from one to five years at January 3, 2016.
The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high-quality money market instruments. The
Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.

The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in 2015, 2014 and
2013 was $102 million, $115 million and $105 million, respectively.
Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2015, 2014 and 2013, was $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion,
respectively.
Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are
eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are
recorded in earnings.
5.Intangible Assets and Goodwill
At the end of 2015 and 2014, the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were:
(Dollars in Millions)  2015  2014
Intangible assets with definite lives:     
Patents and trademarks — gross  $ 8,299 9,074

Goodwill at January 3, 2016  $ 7,240 2,889 11,500 21,629
The weighted average amortization periods for patents and trademarks and customer relationships and other intangible assets are 18 years and 24 years,
respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion before tax, for
the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the five
succeeding years approximates $1.2 billion before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net.
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures.
6.Fair Value Measurements
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange
rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are
treated as fair value hedges. The Company may use forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company
uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts
are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings
effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent
features or requirements to post collateral by either the Company or the counter-party. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counterparty credit
ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial
institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 3, 2016, the Company had notional amounts
outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $31.2 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion,
respectively.
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge
transaction.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly
effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest
expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account and are
insignificant. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If
and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current
period earnings in Other (income) expense, net for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps. For interest rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings within interest expense. For the current reporting
period, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate swaps was not material.

As of January 3, 2016, the balance of deferred net losses on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $36 million after-
tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the
amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected
to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate
contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by
actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.
The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 and

Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the
inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the
lowest.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e. forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all
future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot
foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be
realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The
Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at
fair value.
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.
The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 were as follows:

inputs.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2015, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 15, 2016. Interest charged on borrowings
under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable
margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material.
Throughout 2015, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current
portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $7.0 billion at the end of 2015, of which $4.6

(1)The Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentives.
The 2015 effective tax rate decrease as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to
higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by
the items mentioned below.
The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics
business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S.,
the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned
increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year. These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by
a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture.
                
 47
                                
The 2013 effective tax rate was reduced by a tax benefit associated with the write-off of assets for tax purposes associated with Scios, Inc., and the
inclusion of both the 2013 and 2012 benefit from the Research and Development tax credit and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through
provisions, because those provisions were enacted into law in January 2013 and were retroactive to January 1, 2012.
The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals court’s
decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code (see Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Company’s U.S. Internal
Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009. The impact of the settlement is reflected in the U.S. tax on international income and the All other line
items within the above reconciliation.
The items noted above reflect the key drivers of the rate reconciliation.

The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these
subsidiaries will realize future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets.

The unrecognized tax benefits of $3.1 billion at January 3, 2016, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company
conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The IRS has
completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. In other major jurisdictions where the Company
conducts business, the years remain open generally back to the year 2004. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax
authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months.  However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of
any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.
The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $44 million, $12 million
and $40 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $366 million and $298 million in 2015 and 2014,
respectively.

Prepaid employee related obligations of $256 million and $233 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
10.Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover
most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their
dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last three to five
years before retirement and the number of years of service. In 2014, the Company announced that the U.S. Defined Benefit plan was amended to adopt a
new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. The benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee
compensation over total years of service.
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.
The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.
As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to early adopt a practical expedient beginning for the fiscal
year end 2015 to measure its defined benefit plans using the calendar month end closest to its fiscal year end. In 2015 and 2014 the Company used
December 31, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2015, 2014 and 2013 include the following
components:
  Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans

Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active
employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using
a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.
Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the
plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan
participants at the time of the plan amendment.
The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:

Rate of increase in compensation levels  4.01% 4.05 4.08 4.28 4.11 4.29
The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The
resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. For the fiscal year 2016, the Company will change its methodology in
determining service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the
plans’ liability cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured
service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company
has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change will not impact
the benefit obligation and will not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results.
The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios
globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the
various asset class allocations by market.
In 2014, for measurement of U.S. retirement benefit obligations, the mortality assumption was updated to a newly established 2014 mortality table
resulting in an increase to the projected benefit obligation.

The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in
accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans.
For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that
are not funded.
In 2015, the Company contributed $435 million and $317 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.
The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded
pension plans at December 31, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively:

Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of the pension plans. In
determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax
regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives
to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority
of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed,
with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.
The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2015 and 2014 and target allocations for 2016 are as follows:
  Percent of
Plan Assets  Target
Allocation
  2015  2014  2016
Worldwide Retirement Plans       
Equity securities  79% 77% 74%
Debt securities  21 23 26
Total plan assets  100% 100% 100%
Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If
listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market
parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or
assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Valuation Hierarchy
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are
described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.
•Short-term investments — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian
bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The
NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.
•Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on
which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models,
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an
active market, they are classified as Level 2.
•Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual
securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.
•Equity securities — Common stocks are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.
Substantially all common stock is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
•Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of
the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Assets in the Level 2 category
have a quoted market price in a market that is not active.
                
 54
                                
•Insurance contracts — The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying
investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are
government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor
other observable inputs for pricing.
•Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and
commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1,
while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. Most limited partnerships represent investments in private equity and similar funds that are
valued by the general partners. Certain of these limited partnerships, as well as any other assets valued using unobservable inputs, are classified as
Level 3.

additional details.
14.International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international
subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative
rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical
rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in
the operating results.
A rollforward of the changes during 2015, 2014 and 2013 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.
Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $104 million, $156 million and $186 million in 2015,
2014 and 2013, respectively.
15.Earnings Per Share
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016, December 28,
2014 and December 29, 2013:
(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts)  2015  2014  2013
Basic net earnings per share  $ 5.56 5.80 4.92
Average shares outstanding — basic  2,771.8 2,815.2 2,809.2
Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans  141.5 142.6 148.5
Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method  (102.6) (96.5) (103.3)
Convertible debt shares  2.2 2.6 3.0
Accelerated share repurchase program  — — 19.6
Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted  2,812.9 2,863.9 2,877.0
Diluted net earnings per share  $ 5.48 5.70 4.81
The diluted net earnings per share calculation included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that is offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $3
million after-tax for years 2015 and 2014 and $4 million for year 2013.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for 2015, 2014 and 2013 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options
was less than the average market value of the Company's stock.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 included the dilutive effect of 19.6 million shares, related to the
accelerated share repurchase program, associated with the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. in the fiscal year 2012.
16.Rental Expense and Lease Commitments
Rentals of space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and office and data processing equipment under operating leases were approximately $316 million,
$341 million and $363 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The approximate minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one
year at January 3, 2016 are:

17.Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
                
 57
                                
At January 3, 2016, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares
granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to
650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to
April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 486 million at the end of 2015.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $874 million, $792 million and $728 million for 2015, 2014 and
2013, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $253 million, $259 million and
$243 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $744 million, $722 million and $636 million for 2015,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 0.98 years, 1.18 years and 1.26 years for 2015, 2014, and
2013, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of
shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.
Stock Options
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the
average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted
in the following table. For 2014 and 2013 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 4-year daily historical average volatility rate, and a 5-week
average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For 2015 grants, expected volatility
represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded
Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was
based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $10.68, $8.42 and $4.88, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the
weighted average assumptions of:
 2015  2014  2013
Risk-free rate 1.77% 1.87% 1.01%
Expected volatility 15.48% 14.60% 14.04%
Expected life (in years) 7.0 6.0 6.0
Expected dividend yield 2.90% 3.10% 3.40%

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance
share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance
share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a
three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted
operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary,
based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted.

The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $91.65, $83.01 and $65.90 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, using the fair market value
at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting
period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $597.6 million, $541.0 million and $569.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $93.54, $85.94 and $73.42 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, calculated using the
weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. 
The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value
of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period.  The fair value
for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The
fair value of performance share units issued was $16.7 million and $1.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. No performance share units vested in 2013.

20.Business Combinations and Divestitures
Certain businesses were acquired for $954 million in cash and $220 million of liabilities assumed during 2015. The assumed liabilities primarily represent
the fair value of the contingent consideration of $210 million. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results
of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2015 acquisitions primarily included: XO1 Limited, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company developing an anti-thrombin antibody and
Novira Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for curative treatment of chronic
hepatitis B virus infection.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1,173 million and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $839 million has been identified as the value of IPR&D primarily
associated with the acquisitions of XO1 Limited and Novira Therapeutics, Inc. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections
discounted for the inherent risk in the projects.
                
 63
                                
The IPR&D related to the acquisition of XO1 Limited of $360 million is associated with a recombinant human antibody developed to mimic the
activity of a human antibody which appears to produce an anticoagulated state without predisposition to bleeding. A probability of success factor of 36.0%
was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 11.75%.
The IPR&D related to the acquisition of Novira Therapeutics, Inc. of $396 million is associated with its lead candidate NVR 3-778 which is an
investigational small molecule, direct-acting antiviral, for oral administration in patients with HBV that inhibits the HBV core or capsid protein. A
probability of success factor of 51.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 16.0%.
Certain businesses were acquired for $2,129 million in cash and $38 million of liabilities assumed during 2014. These acquisitions were accounted for
using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition.
The 2014 acquisitions included: Covagen AG, a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of multispecific protein
therapeutics through the FynomAb® technology platform; Alios BioPharma, Inc., a privately-held, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on
developing therapies for viral diseases; and the ORSLTM electrolyte ready-to-drink brand from Jagdale Industries Ltd. The excess of purchase price over
the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $2,069 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual
recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1,913 million has been identified as the value of IPR&D associated with the acquisitions of Covagen
AG and Alios BioPharma, Inc. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects.
The IPR&D related to the acquisition of Alios BioPharma, Inc. (Alios) of $1,688 million is associated with Alios’ lead compound AL-8176, an orally
administered antiviral therapy for treatment of infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A probability of success factor of 60.0% was used to reflect
inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 11.4%. The IPR&D related to the acquisition of Covagen AG of $225 million is
associated with Covagen’s lead compound COVA-322, currently in Phase 1b study for psoriasis and holding potential as a treatment for a broad range of
inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. A probability of success factor of 26.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The
discount rate applied was 12.5%. During 2015, the Company recorded a charge for the impairment of the IPR&D related to the acquisition of Covagen AG.
Certain businesses were acquired for $835 million in cash and $193 million of liabilities assumed during 2013. These acquisitions were accounted for
using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition.
The assumed liabilities primarily represent the fair value of the contingent consideration which may be payable related to the acquisition of Aragon
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately-held, pharmaceutical discovery and development company focused on drugs to treat hormonally-driven cancers. As per
terms of the agreement, additional payments of up to $350 million may be paid in the future based on reaching predetermined milestones.
The 2013 acquisitions included: Flexible Stenting Solutions, Inc., a leading developer of innovative flexible peripheral arterial, venous and biliary
stents; Shanghai Elsker Mother & Baby Co., Ltd, a baby care company in China and Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $941 million and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $831 million has been identified as the value of IPR&D primarily
associated with the acquisitions of Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
The IPR&D related to the acquisition of Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of $810 million is associated with Aragon’s androgen receptor antagonist
program for treatment of hormonally-driven cancers. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in
such projects. Probability of success factors ranging from 37% - 52.0% were used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied
was 15.5%.
In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the
acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements.  In 2013, the Company settled the remaining
liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal
transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one
or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes
shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest.
Supplemental pro forma information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 in accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and
goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
During 2015, the Company divestitures included: The Cordis business to Cardinal Health; the SPLENDA® brand to Heartland Food Products Group
and the U.S. license rights to NUCYNTA® (tapentadol), NUCYNTA ® ER (tapentadol extended-release tablets), and NUCYNTA® (tapentadol) oral
solution. In 2015, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures of businesses were approximately $2.6 billion. As of January 3, 2016, assets held for sale were not
material.
                
 64
                                
During 2014, the Company divestitures included: The Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group; the K-Y® brand to Reckitt Benckiser
Group PLC in the U.S. and certain other markets; and the BENECOL® brand to Raisio plc. In 2014, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures of businesses were
approximately $2.4 billion. The Company completed the divestiture of its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group for approximately
$4.0 billion and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' results are included in the Company's
Medical Devices segment.

Inc.; Rolaids® to Chattem, Inc.; DORIBAX® rights to Shionogi; and the sale of certain consumer brands and certain pharmaceutical products. In 2013, the
pre-tax gains on the divestitures of businesses were $0.1 billion.
21.Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial
and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2016, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation
matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and
adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other
litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or
range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future
events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various
factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is
not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties
involved.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these
cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While these subsidiaries believe they have substantial defenses, it is not
feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with
ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs
needed to defend each matter. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with
settlements, damage and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in
different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes
available.
The most significant of these cases include the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System, the PINNACLE®
Acetabular Cup System, pelvic meshes, RISPERDAL®, and XARELTO®. As of January 3, 2016, in the United States there were approximately 5,300
plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip
Resurfacing System, 8,700 with respect to the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System, 46,700 with respect to pelvic meshes, 10,700 with respect to
RISPERDAL®, and 5,000 with respect to XARELTO®.
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™
Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number
of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a

multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United
States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of
lawyers representing ASR™ Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had
surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. This settlement covered approximately 8,000 patients. In February
2015, DePuy reached an additional agreement which would effectively extend the existing settlement program to ASR Hip patients who had revision
surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 1, 2015. This second agreement is estimated to cover approximately 1,800 additional patients. The
estimated cost of these agreements is covered by existing accruals. This settlement program is expected to bring to a close significant ASR Hip litigation
activity in the United States. However, many lawsuits in the United States will remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the
United States. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company
has established accruals for the costs associated with the DePuy ASR™ Hip program and related product liability litigation. Changes to these accruals may
be required in the future as additional information becomes available.
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson relating to DePuy's PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System used
in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with
respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district
litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States,
primarily in the United Kingdom. The Company has established an accrual to cover only defense costs in connection with product liability litigation
associated with DePuy's PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes
available.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to
treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company
continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have
been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In addition, class actions and
individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in Australia, Belgium, Canada, England, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland and
Venezuela, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. The Company has established an accrual with respect to
product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information
becomes available.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL®,
indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism, and
related compounds. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect
to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with
RISPERDAL®. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of XARELTO®, an oral
anticoagulant. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to
potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States and many cases
have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. The Company
has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with XARELTO®. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as
additional information becomes available.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other
intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on
various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they
have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these
matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market
exclusivity, and require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated
intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below.
Medical Devices
In January 2010, Tyco Healthcare Group, LP (Tyco) and U.S. Surgical Corporation (now Covidien plc) filed a lawsuit against Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.
(EES) in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that EES's HARMONIC® shears infringed three Tyco patents. The case
was tried in July 2012, and in March 2013, the Court ruled that some of EES's HARMONIC® shears infringed Tyco's patents and ordered EES to pay
damages of approximately $176 million, but declined to order injunctive relief. EES appealed and in December 2014, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court's ruling and found all the asserted claims invalid. In July 2015, Tyco filed a motion for review with the
United States Supreme Court. In July 2014, Covidien filed another patent infringement lawsuit against EES in the United States District Court for the
District of Connecticut seeking damages and a preliminary injunction, alleging that EES's newest version of its harmonic scalpels, the HARMONIC
ACE®+ 7 Shears and the HARMONIC ACE®+ Shears, infringed the three Tyco patents asserted in the previous case. The claims asserted by Covidien in
this case are the same claims that were declared invalid in December 2014 by the Court of Appeals in the Tyco case discussed above. In November 2015,
the United States Supreme Court denied Tyco's petition for review; therefore, both cases have been dismissed.
In November 2007, Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc., et al. (Roche) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against LifeScan, Inc. (LifeScan) in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging LifeScan's OneTouch® Line of Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems infringe two patents
related to the use of microelectrode sensors. Roche is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In September 2009, LifeScan obtained a favorable
ruling on claim construction that precluded a finding of infringement. Roche appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's ruling on
claim construction and remanded the case to the District Court for new findings on the issue. In December 2014, the District Court ruled in LifeScan's favor
and reinstated the original claim construction. In February 2015, Roche appealed the ruling, and in February 2016, oral argument took place at the Court of
Appeals. The parties are awaiting a decision.
In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.
(JJVC) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVC's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE®ADVANCE® and
ACUVUE® OASYS® Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringe their U.S. Patent No. 5,712,327 (the '327 patent). Rembrandt is seeking monetary relief. The case
was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. In May 2012, the jury returned a verdict holding that neither of the
accused lenses infringes the '327 patent. Rembrandt appealed, and in August 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the
District Court's judgment. Rembrandt asked the District Court to grant it a new trial based on alleged new evidence, and in July 2014, the District Court
denied Rembrandt’s motion. Rembrandt has appealed the District Court's denial of its motion for a new trial.
In December 2009, the State of Israel filed a lawsuit in the District Court in Tel Aviv Jaffa against Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and various
affiliates (Omrix). In the lawsuit, the State claims that an employee of a government-owned hospital was the inventor on several patents related to fibrin
glue technology that the employee developed while he was a government employee. The State claims that he had no right to transfer any intellectual
property to Omrix because it belongs to the State. The State is seeking damages plus royalties on QUIXIL™ and EVICEL® products, or alternatively,
transfer of the patents to the State. The case remains active, but no trial date has been set.
In September 2011, LifeScan, Inc. (LifeScan) filed a lawsuit against Shasta Technologies, LLC (Shasta), Instacare Corp (now Pharmatech Solutions,
Inc. (Pharmatech)) and Conductive Technologies, Inc. (Conductive) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for patent
infringement and false advertising for the making and marketing of a strip for use in LifeScan's OneTouch® Blood Glucose Meters. The defendants alleged
that the three LifeScan patents-in-suit are invalid and challenged the validity of the asserted patents in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO). In April
                
 67
                                
2013, the defendants brought counterclaims for alleged antitrust violations and false advertising and those claims were stayed pending resolution of the
patent infringement case. The validity of two of the patents was confirmed by the USPTO, but the USPTO determined that the third patent, U.S. Patent No.
7,250,105 (the '105 patent), is invalid. LifeScan lost an appeal of that decision, but is seeking a rehearing. LifeScan entered into a settlement agreement
with Shasta and Conductive. A motion brought by Pharmatech for summary judgment of patent invalidity was argued in February 2016 and the parties are
awaiting a decision. LifeScan's patent infringement and false advertising claims are scheduled to be tried in August 2016.
LifeScan filed a patent infringement lawsuit against UniStrip Technologies, LLC (UniStrip) in the United States District Court for the District of North
Carolina in May 2014, alleging that the making and marketing of Unistrip’s strips infringe the same patents asserted against Shasta above. That case has
been stayed pending the outcome of the appeal of the USPTO's decision on the validity of the '105 patent. In July 2014, UniStrip brought a lawsuit against
LifeScan in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging antitrust violations relating to marketing practices for
LifeScan strips.
In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that all of Cordis's sales of the CYPHER® and CYPHER SELECT™ Stents made in
the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents.  Medinol is seeking damages and
attorney's fees. After trial in January 2014, the District Court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims, and Medinol
did not appeal the decision. In September 2014, the District Court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol's
appeal of this decision has been dismissed. Medinol has filed a petition for review with the United States Supreme Court. Following the divestiture of
Cordis, the Company retains any liability that may result from this case.
In December 2014, Bonutti Skeletal Innovations LLC (Bonutti) sued DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that DePuy Synthes's product line of spine implants infringes six patents owned by Bonutti,
generally covering wedge implants and their methods of implantation. Bonutti is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.
Pharmaceutical
In 2012 and 2013, Noramco, Inc. (Noramco) moved to intervene in several patent infringement lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York by Purdue Pharma L.P. and others (Purdue) against Noramco oxycodone customers, Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Amneal), Watson Laboratories, Inc.- Florida (Watson) and Andrx Labs, LLC (Andrx).
The lawsuits are in response to the defendants' respective Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking approval to market generic extended release
oxycodone products before the expiration of certain Purdue patents. Three of the asserted patents relate to oxycodone and processes for making oxycodone,
and Noramco has agreed to defend the lawsuits on behalf of Impax, Teva, Amneal, Watson, and Andrx. In April 2013, Watson and Andrx entered into a
settlement with Purdue. The trial against Impax and Teva (and others) took place in September 2013, and Noramco defended Teva and Impax. In
November 2013, Impax entered into a settlement with Purdue, and in December 2014, Teva entered into a settlement with Purdue. The District Court
issued a decision in January 2014 invalidating the relevant Purdue patents and, based on that decision, subsequently dismissed the lawsuit against Amneal
(and other parties not defended by Noramco). Purdue appealed the Court's decision. In February 2016, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court
decision invalidating the Purdue patents. If Purdue ultimately prevails in its appeal of the invalidity decision, it can reinstitute its action against Amneal. In
December 2015, Purdue filed another patent infringement action against Amneal in the District of Delaware asserting, among others, the three above-
referenced patents and a newly issued patent relating to oxycodone and processes for making oxycodone.
Johnson & Johnson acquired the prostate cancer business of Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aragon), including ARN-509, a compound being tested for
treatment of prostate cancer, in September 2013. Prior to the acquisition, in May 2011, Medivation, Inc. (Medivation) had sued Aragon and the University
of California seeking rights to ARN-509. In December 2012, the State Court granted summary judgment to Aragon on Medivation's claims, awarding the
rights of the ARN-509 compound to Aragon, and in January 2013, the Court dismissed the case against Aragon. Medivation has appealed.

REMICADE® Related Cases
In September 2013, JBI and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU Medical Center) received an Office Action from the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO) rejecting the claims in U.S. Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE® (the '471 patent) in a reexamination proceeding instituted by a
third party.  The '471 patent is co-owned by JBI and NYU Medical Center, and NYU Medical Center granted JBI an exclusive license to NYU Medical
Center's rights under the patent. Currently, the '471 patent in the United States expires in September 2018. JBI responded to that rejection in December
2013 and in August 2014, JBI and NYU Medical Center received a further rejection. JBI responded to the rejection by filing a further amendment and in
November 2014, JBI's petition to enter the amendment was granted. The application was returned to the examiner for issuance of a new Office Action,
which occurred in February 2015, further rejecting the patent. JBI responded to that rejection and in April 2015, the USPTO issued a further action
maintaining its rejection of the '471 patent. In May 2015, JBI filed a notice of appeal to the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and the appeal is
currently pending. The '471 patent remains a valid and enforceable patent as it undergoes reexamination at the USPTO. JBI will continue to defend the
patent and, if necessary, will pursue all available appeals.
In August 2014, Celltrion filed for FDA approval to make and sell its own biosimilar version of REMICADE®. In March 2015, JBI filed a lawsuit in
the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira seeking a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product
for which they are seeking FDA approval under the new Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA) infringes or potentially infringes six
JBI patents. JBI is also seeking a declaratory judgment that defendants have failed to comply with certain procedural requirements of the BPCIA. In
addition, JBI has moved for a preliminary and permanent injunction to prohibit Celltrion and Hospira from launching their biosimilar product until 180
days after they have given JBI a Notice of Commercial Marketing, such notice not to be given before FDA approval of Celltrion's product. Also in March
2015, JBI moved to stay all proceedings in the District Court with respect to the ‘471 patent, pending the USPTO re-examination proceeding. In August
2015, JBI also filed a motion seeking the District Court's permission to file a patent infringement lawsuit asserting U.S. Patent No. 7,598,083 (the '083
patent) against Celltrion and the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product. Although the '083 patent is
already asserted in the existing lawsuit, this would expand the claims to include any use of the cell media made in the United States to manufacture
Celltrion's biosimilar. In February 2016, Celltrion and Hospira agreed not to launch their biosimilar product before June 30, 2016 and the '471 and '083
patents will be the two remaining patents in the lawsuit. In light of this representation, and because the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to
decide this issue in an unrelated but similar case before June 29th, the Court denied JBI's motion for preliminary injunction, but noted that JBI may renew
its motion following the Court of Appeals decision, if necessary, or if the Court of Appeals fails to decide the issue by June 29th. In addition, in February
2016, Celltrion and Hospira filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity of the ‘471 patent.
In March 2013, Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira) filed an impeachment proceeding against The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology
(Kennedy) challenging the validity of a Canadian patent related to REMICADE® (a Feldman patent), which is exclusively licensed to Janssen Biotech, Inc.
(JBI). In October 2013, Kennedy, along with JBI, Janssen Inc. and Cilag GmbH International (both affiliates of JBI), filed a counterclaim for infringement
against Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd., Celltrion Inc. (together, Celltrion) and Hospira. The counterclaim alleges that the products described in Celltrion’s
and Hospira’s marketing applications to Health Canada for their subsequent entry biologics (SEB) to REMICADE® would infringe the Feldman patents
owned by Kennedy. Discovery in the patent action is ongoing. Trial has been scheduled for September 2016.
In January 2014, Health Canada approved Celltrion’s SEB to REMICADE®, allowing Celltrion to market its biosimilar version of REMICADE® in
Canada, regardless of the pending patent action. In June 2014, Hospira received approval for its SEB to REMICADE®. In July 2014, Janssen Inc. (Janssen)
filed a lawsuit to compel the Canadian Minister of Health to withdraw the Notice of Compliance for Hospira’s SEB because Hospira did not serve a Notice
of Allegation on Janssen to address the patent listed by Janssen on the Patent Register. In March 2015, the parties entered into a settlement agreement
whereby Health Canada agreed to a Consent Judgment setting aside Hospira’s Notice of Compliance, subject to Health Canada's right to appeal, which
appeal was filed in June 2015. Nevertheless, Hospira began marketing a biosimilar version of REMICADE® as a distributor under Celltrion's Notice of
Compliance.
If any of the REMICADE® related patents discussed above is found to be invalid, any such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the
introduction of biosimilar versions of REMICADE®. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United
States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. The timing of the possible introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE®
in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the FDA and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the BPCIA. In
February 2016, the Arthritis Advisory Committee of the FDA recommended approval of Celltrion’s investigational biosimilar version of
                
 69
                                
REMICADE® by a vote of 21-3 across all eligible indications in the United States. There is a risk that a competitor could launch a biosimilar version of
REMICADE® following FDA approval (subject to compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the BPCIA), even though one or more valid patents
are in place. Introduction to the U.S. market of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®.
Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)
The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or
undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson &
Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity
and unenforceability of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stays of the
ANDAs expire before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved will have the ability, upon approval of the
FDA, to introduce generic versions of the products at issue to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle
these actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the
relevant patents.
PREZISTA® 
A number of generic companies have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of PREZISTA®. In November 2010, Tibotec, Inc. (now
Tibotec, LLC) and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (now Janssen R&D Ireland) (collectively, Tibotec) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin, Ltd.,
Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Lupin), Mylan, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Mylan) in the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey in response to Lupin's and Mylan's respective ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Tibotec's PREZISTA®
product before the expiration of Tibotec's patent relating to PREZISTA®. Lupin and Mylan each filed counterclaims alleging non-infringement and
invalidity. In July 2011, Tibotec filed another patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in
response to Lupin's supplement to its ANDA to add new dosage strengths for its proposed product. In August 2011, Tibotec and G.D. Searle & Company
(G.D. Searle) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin and Mylan in response to their notice letters advising that their ANDAs are seeking
approval to market generic versions of Tibotec's PREZISTA® product before the expiration of two additional patents relating to PREZISTA® that Tibotec
exclusively licenses from G.D. Searle. In September 2011, the Court consolidated the above lawsuits (referred to here as the First Consolidated Action).
The approved New Drug Application for PREZISTA® was transferred from Tibotec, Inc. to Janssen Products, LP in December 2011. In 2012 and
2013, Janssen Products, LP and Janssen R&D Ireland (collectively, Janssen) added several patents that they own or exclusively license from G.D. Searle to
the First Consolidated Action against Mylan and Lupin. In June 2013, Janssen and G.D. Searle dismissed their claims relating to the patents owned by G.D.
Searle against Lupin and Mylan, based on those parties’ agreement not to seek FDA approval of their respective ANDAs until the November 2017
expiration of the G.D. Searle patents. After a trial regarding the remaining patents in the First Consolidated Action, the Court issued a decision in August
2014 in favor of Janssen, holding that the asserted patents are valid and would be infringed by Lupin's and Mylan's marketing of their proposed products.
Mylan and Lupin filed an appeal.
In July 2014, Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Mylan in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging
infringement of United States Patent No. 8,153,829. In November 2015, Janssen and Mylan entered into a confidential settlement. Pursuant to the
settlement agreement, the parties are in the process of seeking a dismissal of this action. In addition, the appeal of the August 2014 decision as it relates to
Mylan has been dismissed and remanded to the District Court where the parties are seeking a modification of the Court’s 2014 order in accordance with the
settlement agreement.
In May 2013, Lupin notified Janssen that it filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a new dosage strength of its generic version of PREZISTA®.  In
response, Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Lupin's new dosage
strength would infringe the same patents that Janssen is asserting against Lupin in the original action. In March 2014, Janssen filed a patent infringement
lawsuit against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging infringement of United States Patent No 8,518,987 (the
‘987 patent). In January 2015, the Court consolidated these lawsuits (referred to here as the Second Consolidated Action), and stayed them pending Lupin's
appeal of the Court's decision in the First Consolidated Action. In April 2015, Lupin filed an Inter
                
 70
                                
Partes Review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the ‘987 patent and in October 2015, the USPTO denied Lupin's petition. In January 2016, Janssen
received a patent notice from Lupin advising that Lupin has amended its ANDA to reflect a new formulation of darunavir that Lupin alleges does not
infringe the relevant Janssen patents, and in February 2016, Janssen filed a lawsuit asserting those patents against Lupin in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey. In addition, in January 2016, Lupin filed a motion to stay and deactivate its appeal of the above-referenced August 2014
decision, and to remand the matter to the District Court where Lupin intends to modify the 2014 District Court order and injunction to allow Lupin to
market its new formulation of darunavir before the expiration of the relevant patents.
Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Hetero Drugs, Ltd. Unit III and Hetero USA Inc. in March 2013 in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey, alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 7,126,015 and 7,595,408. In October 2015, the parties stipulated to a
Consent Judgment wherein the Hetero defendants admitted that the patents-in-suit are valid and would be infringed by the manufacture, importation, use or
sale of Hetero’s ANDA product, and agreed to an injunction with respect to such product during the life of the patents-in-suit. Hetero reserved the right to
develop non-infringing darunavir products and processes.
In August 2014, Janssen filed patent infringement lawsuits against Cipla Ltd. and Cipla USA, Inc. (collectively, Cipla) in the United States District
Courts for the Districts of New Jersey and Delaware in response to Cipla’s ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Janssen’s PREZISTA®
product before the expiration of certain of Janssen’s patents relating to PREZISTA®. Cipla filed counterclaims seeking declarations of noninfringement and
invalidity of the patents-in-suit. In May 2015, Janssen and Cipla entered into a settlement agreement.
In response to its Notice of Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of PREZISTA® in Canada before the expiration of Canadian
Patent No. 2,485,834, Janssen Inc. and Janssen R&D Ireland filed a Notice of Application against Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC in July 2014. In December
2014, Janssen R&D Ireland transferred its PREZISTA® patents to Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC was substituted for
Janssen R&D Ireland as plaintiff in the above-referenced actions. In February 2016, the parties entered into a confidential settlement and the Notice of
Application has been dismissed.
In January 2015, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC filed a Notice of Application against Teva Canada Limited in response to its Notice of
Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of PREZISTA® before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,485,834. In October 2015, the
parties entered into a settlement wherein Teva Canada Limited agreed to withdraw its Notice of Allegation without prejudice to file a new one in the future,
and Janssen Inc. and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC agreed to dismiss their Notice of Application.
In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen sought or is seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of PREZISTA®
before the expiration of the relevant patents.
CONCERTA® 
In May 2014, ALZA Corporation (ALZA) and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for
the District of West Virginia against Mylan, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Mylan) in response to its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic
version of CONCERTA® before the expiration of United States Patent No. 8,163,798 (the '798 patent). Mylan filed counterclaims seeking declarations of
invalidity and non-infringement of the patents-in-suit. In May 2015, Mylan sought leave to add a counterclaim for invalidity and non-infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 8,629,179 (the '179 patent) and the Court denied Mylan's motion. In July 2015, Mylan filed a declaratory judgment action in the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania seeking a declaration of invalidity and non-infringement of the '179 patent. In October 2015, the parties entered into a confidential
settlement of both the West Virginia and Pennsylvania actions.
In December 2014, Janssen Inc. and ALZA filed a Notice of Application against Actavis Pharma Company (Actavis) in response to its Notice of
Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of CONCERTA® before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,264,852 (the ‘852 patent). The
hearing is scheduled for September 2016.
In February 2015, Janssen Inc. and ALZA filed a Notice of Application against Apotex Inc. (Apotex) in response to its Notice of Allegation seeking
approval to market a generic version of CONCERTA® before the expiration of the '852 patent. In August 2015, Janssen Inc. and ALZA voluntarily
dismissed the Notice of Application.
In each of the above lawsuits, ALZA and/or JPI sought or are seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of
CONCERTA® before the expiration of the relevant patents.
                
 71
                                
ZYTIGA® 
In June and July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received notices of paragraph IV certification from several companies advising of their respective
ANDAs seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of one or more patents relating to ZYTIGA®. In July 2015, JBI, Janssen
Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd. (BTG) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in
the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against several generic ANDA applicants (and certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) in
response to their respective ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of United States Patent Nos.
5,604,213 (the '213 patent) (expiring December 2016) and/or 8,822,438 (the '438 patent) (expiring August 2027). The generic companies include Actavis
Laboratories, FL, Inc. (Actavis); Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and
Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr.
Reddy's); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc.
(collectively, Par); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.
(Teva); Wockhardt Bio A.G.; Wockhardt USA LLC and Wockhardt Ltd. (collectively, Wockhardt); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. (West-Ward); and
Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hikma). The Court entered a stay of the New Jersey lawsuit against each of Par and Citron, as each agreed to be bound by
the decision against the other defendants in the New Jersey action. In February 2016, the New Jersey Court set a trial date of October 2017.
In August 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an additional jurisdictional protective lawsuit against the Mylan defendants in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of West Virginia. In October 2015, Mylan filed a motion to dismiss the New Jersey lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction and
improper venue. In February 2016, the West Virginia Court stayed the West Virginia case pending a decision on Mylan's motion to dismiss in the New
Jersey lawsuit, but set a conditional trial date of February 2018. The Court will dismiss the West Virginia lawsuit if Mylan's motion to dismiss in New
Jersey is denied.
In August 2015, JBI received a notice of paragraph IV certification from Hetero USA Inc., the U.S. Regulatory Agent for Hetero Labs Limited Unit-V,
a division of Hetero Labs Limited (collectively, Hetero) advising of Hetero’s ANDA seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA® before expiration
of the '438 patent. In September 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an amended complaint in the New Jersey lawsuit to allege infringement of the '438 patent by
Hetero.     
The filing of the above-referenced lawsuits triggered a stay until October 2018 during which the FDA will not grant final approval of the generics'
ANDAs unless there is an earlier district court decision finding the patents-in-suit invalid or not infringed.
In December 2015, Amerigen Pharmaceuticals Limited filed a petition for an Inter Partes Review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the '438 patent.
In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of ZYTIGA® before the
expiration of the relevant patents.
COMPLERA® 
In August and September 2015, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (collectively, Janssen) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Gilead
Sciences Ireland UC (collectively, Gilead) filed patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and West
Virginia against Mylan, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Mylan) in response to their ANDA seeking approval to market a generic
version of COMPLERA® before the expiration of United States Patent Nos. 8,841,310; 7,125,879; and 8,101,629. In September 2015, Mylan filed an
Answer in the West Virginia action that included counterclaims seeking declarations of invalidity and non-infringement of the patents-in-suit as well as
United States Patent No. 8,080,551. In September 2015, Mylan filed a motion to dismiss the Delaware lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction. In January
2016, Janssen and Gilead filed a first amended complaint in the New Jersey Action adding claims for patent infringement with respect to United States
Patent Nos. 7,399,856 and 7,563,922.  In addition, in the New Jersey Action, the Court dismissed Mylan’s motion to dismiss and set a trial date of February
2018, and in the West Virginia Action, the Court set a trial date of December 2017. In February 2016, Mylan renewed its motion to dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction.
In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of COMPLERA® before the
expiration of the relevant patents.
                
 72
                                
XARELTO® 
A number of generic companies have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO®. In October 2015, Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) and Bayer Pharma AG and Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH (collectively, Bayer) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against
Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc., Micro Labs USA Inc., Micro Labs Ltd., Mylan
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan Inc., Prinston Pharmaceutical, Inc., Sigmapharm Laboratories, LLC, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Limited and Torrent Pharma
Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in response to those parties’ respective ANDAs seeking approval to market generic
versions of XARELTO® before the expiration of Bayer’s United States Patent Nos. 7,157,456, 7,585,860 and 7,592,339 relating to XARELTO®. JPI is the
exclusive licensee of the asserted patents. JPI is seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of XARELTO® before the
expiration of the relevant patents. In November 2015, Mylan moved to dismiss the action. In December 2015, JPI, Bayer, and Mylan stipulated and agreed
to dismiss the claims against Mylan Inc. and suspend further briefing and argument on Mylan's motion to dismiss pending appeals relating to personal
jurisdiction over Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the District of Delaware.
In January 2016, JPI and Bayer received a paragraph IV notice from Invagen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Invagen) advising that it is seeking FDA approval for a
generic XARELTO® product before expiration of the relevant patents. In February 2016, JPI and Bayer filed a patent infringement action against Invagen
asserting the same XARELTO® patents asserted in the original case, and the Invagen case has been consolidated with the original case.  The Court set a
trial date of March 2018.
GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive
regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with
government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is
possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, are
defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products
amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale
Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. Many of these cases, both
federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on
AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. In June 2007, after a trial on the merits, the MDL
Court dismissed the claims of two of the plaintiff classes against the J&J AWP Defendants. In March 2011, the Court dismissed the claims of the third class
against the J&J AWP Defendants without prejudice.
AWP cases brought by various Attorneys General have proceeded to trial against other manufacturers. Several state cases against certain subsidiaries
of Johnson & Johnson have been settled, including the case in Alaska, which settled in April 2014, and cases are still pending in Illinois, New Jersey,
Wisconsin and Utah. The cases in Illinois, New Jersey and Wisconsin have not yet proceeded to trial. In Utah, the claims brought by the Attorney General
were dismissed by the Court in 2013, but the State may appeal the dismissal after the conclusion of similar pending matters against other defendants. The
AWP case against the J&J AWP Defendants brought by the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was tried in Commonwealth Court in
2010. The Court found in the Commonwealth's favor with regard to certain of its claims under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer
Protection Law (“UTPL”), entered an injunction, and awarded $45 million in restitution and $6.5 million in civil penalties. The Court found in the J&J
AWP Defendants' favor on the Commonwealth's claims of unjust enrichment, misrepresentation/fraud, civil conspiracy, and on certain of the
Commonwealth's claims under the UTPL. The J&J AWP Defendants appealed the Commonwealth Court's UTPL ruling, and in June 2014, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court
                
 73
                                
vacated the judgment entered by the Commonwealth Court and remanded the case for further proceedings. On remand, in January 2015, the
Commonwealth Court dismissed the monetary awards against the J&J AWP Defendants. In March 2015, the ruling was appealed back to the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court. In December 2015, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the Order of the Commonwealth Court dismissing the monetary awards
against the J&J AWP Defendants.
RISPERDAL® 
In November 2013, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), finalized previously disclosed settlement agreements with
the United States Department of Justice and forty-five states resolving federal investigations and state Medicaid claims related to past promotional practices
of RISPERDAL® from 1999 through 2005, and other matters. JPI had also settled alleged consumer fraud claims in connection with the sale and marketing
of RISPERDAL® with thirty-six states and the District of Columbia in September 2012. In addition to these actions, the Attorneys General of several states
brought actions against JPI, related to the sale and marketing of RISPERDAL®, seeking one or more of the following remedies: reimbursement of
Medicaid or other public funds for RISPERDAL® prescriptions written for off-label use, compensation for treating their citizens for alleged adverse
reactions to RISPERDAL®, civil fines or penalties for violations of state false claims acts or consumer fraud statutes, punitive damages, or other relief
relating to alleged unfair business practices. Certain of these actions also sought injunctive relief relating to the promotion of RISPERDAL®. Many of the
actions and claims brought by the state Attorneys General have been settled, either individually or as part of the settlements described above. The cases
brought by the Attorneys General of Mississippi and Kentucky were settled in December 2015, without any admission of wrongdoing on the part of JPI.
State cases that went to judgment after trial are discussed below.
In 2004, the Attorney General of West Virginia commenced a lawsuit against Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. (now JPI) based on claims of alleged
consumer fraud as to DURAGESIC®, as well as RISPERDAL®. JPI was found liable and damages were assessed at $4.5 million. JPI filed an appeal, and in
November 2010, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision. In December 2010, the Attorney General of West Virginia
dismissed the case as it related to RISPERDAL® without any payment. Thereafter, JPI settled the case insofar as it related to DURAGESIC®.
In 2004, the Attorney General of Louisiana filed a multi-count Complaint against Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. (now JPI). Johnson & Johnson was later
added as a defendant. The case was tried in October 2010. The issue tried to the jury was whether Johnson & Johnson or JPI had violated the State's
Medical Assistance Program Integrity Law (the Act) through misrepresentations allegedly made in the mailing of a November 2003 Dear Health Care
Professional letter regarding RISPERDAL®. The jury returned a verdict that JPI and Johnson & Johnson had violated the Act and awarded $257.7 million
in damages. The trial judge subsequently awarded the Attorney General counsel fees and expenses in the amount of $73 million. In January 2014, the
Louisiana Supreme Court reversed the District Court’s judgment in favor of the Attorney General, and rendered judgment in favor of Johnson & Johnson
and JPI. In April 2014, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied the Attorney General's petition seeking a rehearing of the appellate arguments, resulting in
final dismissal of the case.
In 2007, the Office of General Counsel of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. (now JPI) on a
multi-Count Complaint related to Janssen Pharmaceutica's sale of RISPERDAL® to the Commonwealth's Medicaid program. The trial occurred in June
2010. The trial judge dismissed the case after the close of the plaintiff's evidence. The Commonwealth filed an appeal and in July 2012, the Pennsylvania
Appeals Court upheld the dismissal of the Commonwealth's case.
In 2007, the Attorney General of South Carolina filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. (now JPI) on several
counts. In March 2011, the matter was tried to a jury on liability only, at which time the lawsuit was limited to claims of violation of the South Carolina
Unfair Trade Practices Act, including, among others, questions of whether Johnson & Johnson or JPI engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the
conduct of any trade or commerce by distributing the November 2003 Dear Health Care Professional letter regarding RISPERDAL® or in their use of the
product's FDA-approved label. The jury found in favor of Johnson & Johnson and against JPI. In June 2011, the Court awarded civil penalties of
approximately $327.1 million against JPI. JPI appealed this judgment and in February 2015, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s
decision in part, reversed it in part and remanded the case back to the trial court. The net effect of the decision was to reduce the judgment to approximately
$136 million, plus interest. In the first fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company accrued $136 million. In March 2015, JPI filed a Petition for Rehearing. In July
2015, the South Carolina Supreme Court granted the Petition and filed a substituted opinion. The new opinion reduced the judgment from approximately
$136 million to approximately $124 million. In January 2016, the United States Supreme Court denied JPI's request for review, putting an end to this case.
                
 74
                                
In April 2012, in the lawsuit brought by the Attorney General of Arkansas, the jury found against both JPI and Johnson & Johnson, and the Court
imposed penalties in the amount of approximately $1.2 billion. In January 2013, the trial court awarded attorney fees of approximately $181 million. JPI
and Johnson & Johnson appealed both awards to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and in March 2014, the Arkansas Supreme Court dismissed the State’s claim
under the Arkansas Medicaid Fraud False Claims Act, as well as the approximately $1.2 billion in penalties, and reversed and remanded a claim under the
Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. In April 2014, the Arkansas Supreme Court rejected a petition by the State for rehearing on the case. In May
2015, the matter settled for $7.75 million.
McNeil Consumer Healthcare
Starting in June 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., McNeil Consumer
Healthcare Division) (McNeil Consumer Healthcare) and certain affiliates, including Johnson & Johnson (the Companies), received grand jury subpoenas
from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania requesting documents broadly relating to recalls of various products of
McNeil Consumer Healthcare, and the FDA inspections of the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania and Lancaster, Pennsylvania manufacturing facilities, as well
as certain documents relating to recalls of a small number of products of other subsidiaries. In addition, in February 2011, the government served McNEIL-
PPC, Inc. (McNEIL-PPC) with a Civil Investigative Demand seeking records relevant to its investigation to determine if there was a violation of the
Federal False Claims Act. In March 2015, McNEIL-PPC entered a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to
a misdemeanor violation of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. McNEIL- PPC agreed to pay a $20 million fine and a $5 million forfeiture to resolve
the matter.
The Companies have also received Civil Investigative Demands from multiple State Attorneys General Offices broadly relating to the McNeil recall
issues. The Companies continue to cooperate with these inquiries, which are being coordinated through a multi-state coalition. If a resolution cannot be
reached with this multi-state coalition, it is possible that individual State Attorneys General Offices may file civil monetary claims against the Companies.
In January 2011, the Oregon Attorney General filed a civil complaint against Johnson & Johnson, McNEIL-PPC and McNeil Healthcare LLC in state court
alleging civil violations of the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act relating to an earlier recall of a McNeil OTC product. In November 2012, the state
court granted a motion by the Companies to dismiss Oregon's complaint in its entirety, with prejudice, and Oregon appealed that decision.  In November
2015, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon reversed the trial court and reinstated Oregon's consumer protection claims. In December 2015, the
Companies filed a petition for review with the Oregon Supreme Court.
Opioids Litigation
Along with other pharmaceutical companies, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) have been named in two lawsuits alleging
claims related to marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC®, NUCYNTA® and NUCYNTA® ER.  In May 2014, Santa Clara and Orange Counties in
California (the Counties) filed a complaint in state court in Orange County, California against numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers, including J&J and
JPI, alleging claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, and public nuisance. The Counties seek injunctive
and monetary relief. In February 2015, the defendants filed motions challenging the sufficiency of the complaint. In August 2015, the Court stayed the case
until the FDA concludes its ongoing inquiry into the safety and effectiveness of long-term opioid treatment.
In June 2014, the City of Chicago filed a complaint in Cook County Circuit Court against the same group of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including
J&J and JPI, alleging a number of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including consumer fraud violations and false claims, and seeking
injunctive and monetary relief. The case was later removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and in December 2014,
J&J and JPI filed a motion to dismiss the City of Chicago's First Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim. In November 2015, J&J and JPI filed a
motion to dismiss the City of Chicago's Second Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim.
In September 2014, the Tennessee Attorney General Division of Consumer Affairs issued a Request for Information to JPI and other pharmaceutical
companies related to opioids marketing practices.
In August 2015, the New Hampshire Attorney General, Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau issued a subpoena to JPI and other pharmaceutical
companies related to opioids marketing practices. JPI objected to private contingent fee counsel’s participation in the investigation on the State’s behalf,
and in October 2015, the State moved to enforce the subpoena.
                
 75
                                
In December 2015, the State of Mississippi filed a complaint in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County against the same
group of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including J&J and JPI, alleging a number of claims related to opioid marketing practices. The State of Mississippi
is seeking penalties and injunctive and monetary relief.
Other
In September 2011, Synthes, Inc. (Synthes) received a Civil Investigative Demand issued pursuant to the False Claims Act from the United States
Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Demand sought information regarding allegations that fellowships had been offered to
hospitals in exchange for agreements to purchase products. Synthes has produced documents and information in response to the Demand and is cooperating
with the inquiry.
In May 2012, Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting
documents broadly relating to the sales, marketing and alleged off-label promotion by Acclarent of the RELIEVA STRATUS® MicroFlow Spacer product
(the STRATUS® Spacer). In April 2015, an Indictment was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging the former
President/CEO and Vice President of Sales of Acclarent (the former Acclarent officers). The Indictment charges the former Acclarent officers with various
violations related to the off-label promotion of the STRATUS® Spacer. The allegations against the former Acclarent officers relate to the development, sale
and marketing of the STRATUS® Spacer, as well as actions allegedly taken by the former Acclarent officers in connection with the acquisition of Acclarent
by Ethicon, Inc. in 2010. There are no charges against Acclarent, Ethicon, Inc. or Johnson & Johnson.
In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (the Companies) received
an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of
Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the
Companies. The District Court issued an order in August 2014 that publicly unsealed the United States' declination notice; however, the complaint in the
matter remains under seal. In addition, in October 2013, a group of state Attorneys General issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development,
sales and marketing of several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.’s hip products. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these
matters independently of the other states, announced a settlement of its ASR™ XL Hip device investigation for a total payment of $4 million to the State of
Oregon.
In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation
of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson
& Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state
investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and
injunctive relief.
In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD)
franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that
the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex® (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts® System during the period 2000
to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation.
Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013. OCD and Johnson & Johnson retain certain
liabilities that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014, the United States Attorney’s Office
requested that Johnson & Johnson produce certain documents, and Johnson & Johnson is cooperating with the request. Following the divestiture of OCD,
Johnson & Johnson retains OCD’s portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos.
In recent years, Johnson & Johnson has received numerous requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information
relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.

GENERAL LITIGATION
In September 2006, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against Guidant Corporation (Guidant) in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York, alleging that Guidant breached provisions of a merger agreement between Johnson & Johnson and Guidant. In June 2011, Guidant filed a
motion for summary judgment and in July 2014, the judge denied Guidant’s motion. The trial concluded in January 2015 and in February 2015, before a
decision was issued by the Court, Johnson & Johnson and Guidant entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant to which Guidant agreed to pay Johnson
& Johnson $600 million and agreed that it will not sue Johnson & Johnson or its affiliates for patent infringement regarding certain stent products. Johnson
& Johnson dismissed its action against Guidant with prejudice. The Company recorded a gain associated with this transaction in fiscal first quarter of 2015.
In June 2009, following the public announcement that Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) had received a grand jury subpoena from the United
States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, in connection with an investigation that has since been closed, multiple class action complaints were filed
against OCD by direct purchasers seeking damages for alleged price fixing. These cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In re Blood Reagent Antitrust Litigation. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson
retains any liability that may result from these cases. In August 2012, the District Court granted a motion filed by Plaintiffs for class certification. In April
2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the class certification ruling and remanded the case to the District Court for further
proceedings. In October 2015, the District Court again granted the motion by Plaintiffs for class certification.
In September 2011, Johnson & Johnson, Johnson & Johnson Inc. and McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of Johnson & Johnson Inc. received a
Notice of Civil Claim filed by Nick Field in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada (the BC Civil Claim). The BC Civil Claim is a putative class
action brought on behalf of persons who reside in British Columbia and who purchased during the period between September 20, 2001 and in or about
December 2010 one or more various McNeil infants' or children's over-the-counter medicines that were manufactured at the Fort Washington facility. The
BC Civil Claim alleges that the defendants violated the BC Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, and other Canadian statutes and common
laws, by selling medicines that were allegedly not safe and/or effective or did not comply with Canadian Good Manufacturing Practices. The class
certification hearing scheduled for October 2015 was adjourned, and there is currently no date set for that hearing.
In August 2014, United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) issued a Penalty Notice against Janssen Ortho LLC (Janssen Ortho),
assessing penalties for the alleged improper classification of darunavir ethanolate (PREZISTA®) in connection with its importation into the United States.
In October 2014, Janssen Ortho submitted a Petition for Relief in response to the Penalty Notice. In May 2015, US CBP issued an Amended Penalty Notice
assessing substantial penalties and Janssen Ortho filed its Petition for Relief in July 2015.
In March 2015, Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco) filed a complaint against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) in the United States
District Court of the Northern District of California, alleging antitrust claims of an unlawful vertical price fixing agreement between JJVCI, Costco and
unnamed other distributors and retailers. Costco alleges that the alleged agreements harmed competition by causing increases in the price Costco customers
pay for JJVCI contact lenses. Costco is seeking an injunction and monetary damages. In June 2015, the case was transferred to the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Florida along with related class action cases described below. In November 2015, the Court denied a JJVCI motion to
dismiss.
In March and April 2015, over 30 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens patients in a number of courts around the United States
against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI), other contact lens manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, alleging vertical and horizontal
conspiracies to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints alleged that the manufacturers reached agreements between each other and certain
distributors and retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages. All of the
class action cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015 along with the related case filed by
Costco Wholesale Corporation described above. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action complaint in November 2015, and in December 2015,
JJVCI and other defendants filed motions to dismiss.
In April 2015, Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against the
State of Utah seeking a declaratory judgment that a law passed by the state to ban unilateral pricing policies solely in the contact lens market violates the
Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  The Court denied JJVCI's motion for a preliminary injunction. JJVCI appealed. Argument on the
appeal was held in August 2015.

In April 2015, Adimmune Corporation Ltd (Adimmune) commenced an arbitration in the International Court of Arbitration - International Chamber of
Commerce against Crucell Switzerland AG (now Janssen Vaccines AG) and Crucell Holland BV (collectively, Crucell).  Adimmune claims that Crucell
breached certain agreements relating to the supply of flu antigen when Crucell ceased purchasing flu antigen from Adimmune. In December 2015,
Adimmune filed its Statement of Claim seeking monetary damages. 
In August 2015, two third-party payors filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against
Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Janssen Ortho LLC, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and Johnson &
Johnson (as well as certain Bayer entities), alleging that the defendants improperly marketed and promoted XARELTO® as safer and more effective than
less expensive alternative medications while failing to fully disclose its risks.  The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount.
Johnson & Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost
of past and/or future remediation.

The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment to better serve the needs of patients and customers in today’s evolving
healthcare marketplace. The Company is undertaking actions to strengthen its go-to-market model, accelerate the pace of innovation, further prioritize key
platforms and geographies, and streamline operations while maintaining high quality standards.
The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most
of which are expected to be incurred by 2017. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $590 million, of which $81
million is included in cost of products sold. The $590 million restructuring charge consists of severance costs of $484 million, asset write-offs of $86
million and $20 million in other costs, primarily related to supply contracts.
Additionally, as part of the plan, the Company expects that the restructuring actions will result in position eliminations of approximately 4 to 6 percent
of the Medical Devices segment’s global workforce over the next two years, subject to any consultation procedures in countries, where required.
The Company estimates that approximately one half of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays, including
approximately $500 million of employee severance. Approximately one half of the cumulative pre-tax costs are non-cash,
relating primarily to facility rationalization, inventory write-offs and intangible asset write-offs.
The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending for the fiscal year ended 2015:
(Dollars in Millions)Severance Asset Write-offs Other Total
2015 restructuring charge $ 484 86 20 590
Current year activity — 86 3 89
Reserve balance, January 3, 2016* $ 484 — 17 501
     
*Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 24 months in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, statements of comprehensive income,
statements of equity, and statements of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries at
January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 3,
2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting." Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred tax assets and liabilities in
2015.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2016. In
making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness
of its internal controls over financial reporting.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 3, 2016, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Vice President, Finance
and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Caruso concluded that, as of the
end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to
"Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in
the "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" included in Item 8 of this Report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  During the fiscal quarter ended January 3, 2016, there were no changes in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human
resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s
financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and
operation of its financial control environment.

EXHIBIT 99
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 — “SAFE HARBOR” FOR
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Company may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements in publicly-released materials, both written and oral. Forward-looking
statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the
future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of
similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the Company’s strategy for growth,
product development, regulatory approvals, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events. These statements therefore are subject
to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the Company’s
expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the Company
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
Some important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company’s forward-
looking statements are as follows:
• Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on
revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
• Competitive factors, including technological advances achieved and patents attained by competitors as well as new products introduced by
competitors, and market share gains by competitors' branded products or by biosimilar or generic products/store brands;
• Challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors or allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties, which could
adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question, result in a loss of sales due to a loss in market exclusivity and require the
payment of past damages and future royalties. In particular, firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product
Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar
forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event that
the Company is not successful in defending the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the
market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses;
• The impact of patent expirations on the Company's business and operating results. As patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce
and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars and generics, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales
and results of operations;
• Significant changes in customer relationships or changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services,
including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care
insurance coverage;
• The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental
controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
• Health care changes in the U.S. and other countries resulting in pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among health care
providers, trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of health care
expenses and laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement, access, and pricing, generally;
• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to the planned restructuring actions in the Medical Device segment may not be
realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required consultation procedures relating to restructuring of workforce;
• Uncertainty of commercial success for new and existing products and of the ability of the Company to successfully execute strategic plans,
including restructuring plans;
• Government laws and regulations, affecting U.S. and international operations, including those relating to taxes, pricing and reimbursement,
regulatory approval of new products, licensing and patent rights, environmental protection, conflict minerals, possible drug reimportation legislation,
trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and securities laws compliance;
• Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and
processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product and process obsolescence. The development of new and improved
products is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. Investments in, and development and commercialization collaborations for,
externally sourced innovation are inherently risky, with no guarantee of success;
• Challenges and difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation,
complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the U.S. and internationally, gain and maintain market approval of products, the possibility of
encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patent or other intellectual property rights which can preclude or delay
commercialization of a product, and challenges involved in post-market surveillance activities and studies and data collection and analysis in the real
world context;
• Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on
the part of the FDA (or international counterparts) or declining sales;
• Significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims, patent infringement claims and antitrust
claims. Due to the uncertain nature of litigation and government action, the outcome in any one matter may result in charges in excess of any
established accruals;
• Product liability insurance for products may be limited, cost prohibitive or unavailable;
• Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions
carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business. Failure to meet compliance
obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or the Corporate Integrity Agreements of the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Affiliates or
the DePuy Synthes Companies, or any other compliance agreements with governments or government agencies could result in significant sanctions;
• Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally or within the supply chain, that cause voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or
shutdowns, product shortages, substantial modifications to our business practices and operations, withdrawals or suspensions of current products from
the market, or possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution;
• Interruptions and breaches of the Company's computer and communications systems, and those of the Company's vendors, including computer
viruses, “hacking” and “cyber-attacks,” that could impair the Company's ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with its
customers, or result in the theft of trade secrets or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise privacy of sensitive information
belonging to the Company, its customers or other business partners;
• The impact of business combinations, including acquisitions and divestitures, both by and for the Company, as well as externally in the
pharmaceutical, medical devices and consumer industries, and the potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any acquisition
or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;
• Market conditions and the possibility that the on-going share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued;
• Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex, subject to increasing regulatory requirements that
may adversely affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products, and which may involve multiple third parties, require significant
capital expenditures, and be subject to lengthy regulatory approvals;
• Financial distress and bankruptcies experienced by significant customers and suppliers that could impair their ability, as the case may be, to
purchase the Company’s products, pay for products previously purchased or meet their obligations to the Company under supply arrangements;
• The possibility that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions consummated in
connection with the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares
could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest;
• Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause
disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall
design and integrity of the Company's products and operations;
• The impact on political and economic conditions due to terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other parts of the world or U.S. military action overseas,
as well as instability in the financial markets which could result from such terrorism or military actions; and
• Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact upon the Company’s ability to achieve results described in any forward-
looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company has identified the factors on this list as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995.
