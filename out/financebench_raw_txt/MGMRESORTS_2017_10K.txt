Overview
 
MGM
 Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns andoperates
 integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau. As discussed further below, we lease certain of our real estateassets from MGM Growth Properties Opera
ting Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”), which is a consolidated subsidiary. 
We
 believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitiveadvantage. We make signi
ficant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as othernew
 features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premierresorts in their respe
ctive markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. 
MGM
Growth
Properties
On April 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidat
ed subsidiary, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”). MGP is organized as anumbrella
 partnership  REIT  (commonly  referred  to  as  an  “UPREIT”)  structure  in  which  substantially  all  of  its  assets  are  owned  by,  and  substantially  all  of  itsbusinesses are conducted through 
the Operating Partnership. MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”):Class
 A shares and a single Class B share. We own MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receivedistributions
 from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while we, as theowner
 of the Class B share, are entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as our and our controlledaffiliates’ (excluding
 MGP and its subsidiaries) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does notfall below 30%. The sole gener
al partner of the Operating Partnership is also a subsidiary of MGP.MGP used the proceeds from its IPO to purch
ase operating partnership units in the Operating Partnership. Concurrently, we contributed the real estate assetsassociated
 with The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit and BeauRivage
 to  the  Operating  Partnership  in  exchange  for  operating  partnership  units.  A  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Operating  Partnership  (the  “landlord”)subsequently leased t
he properties to a subsidiary of ours (the “tenant”) pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement (the “master lease”).  In
 August  2016,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming  Corporation’s  (“Boyd  Gaming”)  ownership  interest  in  Borgata,  at  which  time  Borgatabecame
 a consolidated subsidiary of ours. Subsequently, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from us, and in October 2017, MGP also acquired the long-termleasehold
 interest and real property associated with MGM National Harbor from us. In connection with these transactions, we entered into amendments to themaster lease for our subs
idiary to lease back the real estate assets of Borgata and MGM National Harbor from the landlord.As
 of December 31, 2017, we owned 73.4% of the Operating Partnership units, and MGP held the remaining 26.6% ownership interest in the OperatingPartnership.  
 
Resort
Operations
 
General
 
Most
 of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily onthe
 ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investmentsand repay debt financings.
 
2

 Our results of operations do not tend
 to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major
 conventions,  the  amount  and  timing  of  marketing  and  special  events  for  our  high-end  gaming  customers,  and  the  level  of  play  during  major  holidays,including
 New Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual  customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generatedfrom high-end gaming customers, which can
 cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customersand the finan 
cial health of custom er segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. 
All of our
 casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates 22 hours a day, every day of theyear.
 At our domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us,owned
 by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We utilize third-party management for specific expertise in operations of restaurantsand nightclubs. We lease spa
ce to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.

More
 detailed  information  about  each  of  our  operating  resorts  can  be  found  in  Exhibit  99.1  to  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  which  Exhibit  isincorporated herein by r
eference.   
Reportable
Segments
 
We
 have two reportable segments based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments: domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently own andoperate
 14 resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations consist of the MGM Macau resort and casino (“MGM Macau”) and MGM Cotai, an integratedcasino,
 hotel,  and  entertainment  resort  on  the  Cotai  Strip  in  Macau  that  opened  on  February  13,  2018.  We  have  additional  business  activities  including  ourinvestments
 in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”) is our most significantunconsolidated affiliate,
 which we also manage for a fee. See “Executive Overview” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resultsof Operations and Note 17 in the ac
companying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our segments. 







Domestic
Resorts
 
Over
 half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and othernon-gaming amenities.
 We market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy andcustomer
 volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turnaffects the price we 
can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities. 
Our
 casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge expe
riences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere. 
MGM
China
 
We
 own  approximately  56%  of  MGM  China,  which  owns  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  S.A.  (“MGM  Grand  Paradise”),  the  Macau  company  that  owns  andoperates
 the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGMChina plays
 an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is the world’s largest gaming destinationin terms of revenue and we exp
ect future growth in the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. 
Our
 current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily fromgaming
 operations  which  are  conducted  under  a  gaming  subconcession  held  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise.  The  Macau  government  has  granted  three  gamingconcessions
 and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by Sociedade de Jogosde
 Macau, S.A., and expires in 2020. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on thenumber
 of  casinos  or  gaming  areas  operated  by  the  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires,  though  additional  casinos  require  government  approval  prior  tocommencing operations.
 
In
 October 2012, MGM Grand Paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of Macau to developMGM
 Cotai  on  an  approximately  18  acre  site  on  the  Cotai  Strip.  The  land  concession  contract  became  effective  when  the  Macau  government  published  theagreement
 in the Official Gazette of Macau on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. MGM Cotai is an integrated casino, hotel and entertainmentresort
 that opened on February 13, 2018. The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau of Macau (“DICJ”) approved 100 gaming tables for the opening ofMGM
 Cotai  and  25  additional  gaming  tables  effective  for  operation  on  January  1,  2019,  for  a  total  of  125  gaming  tables  in  aggregate.  In  addition,  the  DICJapproved
 the initial transfer of 77 gaming tables from MGM Macau to MGM Cotai. We expect total development costs of our Cotai project to be approximately$3.4 billion, excluding developm
ent fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land-related costs. 
Customers
and
Competition
 
Our
 casino  resorts  operate  in  highly  competitive  environments.  We  compete  against  gaming  companies,  as  well  as  other  hospitality  companies  in  themarkets
 in  which  we  operate,  neighboring  markets,  and  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  including  non-gaming  resort  destinations  such  as  Hawaii.  Our  gamingoperations
 compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in theUnited States and internat
ionally.   
4

 Our primary methods of success
ful competition include: 
• Locating our resorts in desi rable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets; 
• Constructing  and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premierdining, entertainment, retail a
nd other amenities; 
• Recruiting, training and r etaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service; 
• Providing unique, “must-see” en tertainment attractions; and 
• Developing distinctive and m emorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs. 







Domestic
Resorts
 
Our customers
 include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions,trade
 associations, and small meetings. We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure andvalue-oriented
 tour and travel  customers.  Many of our resorts have significant  convention and meeting  space which we utilize  to drive business to our resortsduring mid-week and off-peak p
eriods. 
Our
 Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on ornear
 the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotelcasinos elsewhere
 in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have eitherrecently
 expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areasoutside Las Vegas has increased 
the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas. 
Outside
 Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, wherelocation is a criti
cal factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. 







MGM
China
 
The
 three  primary  customer  bases  in  the  Macau  gaming  market  are  VIP  casino  gaming  operations,  main  floor  gaming  operations  and  slot  machineoperations.
 VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters whooffer
 VIP players various services, such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel, food and beverage services. Gaming promoters are compensatedthrough
 payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover based commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission basedon
 the  program  in  which  they  participate.  Unlike  gaming  promoters  and  in-house  VIP  players,  main  floor  players  do  not  receive  commissions.  The  profitcontribution
 from the main floor segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gamingfloors
 have  grown  significantly  in  recent  years  and  we  believe  this  customer  base  represents  the  most  potential  for  sustainable  growth  in  the  future.  To  targetpremium
 main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table gamesterminals,
 which  include  both  table  games  and  slots,  to  the  main  floor  gaming  area.  The  amenities  create  a  dedicated  exclusive  gaming  space  for  the  use  ofpremium main floor pl
ayers.   
Our
 key  competitors  in  Macau  include  five  other  gaming  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.  If  the  Macau  government  were  to  grant  additionalconcessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which
 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations orcash
 flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the CotaiStrip, with several openings having o
ccurred during 2016 and another casino resort expected to open in 2019. 
We
 encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world, including Singapore, Korea, Australia, NewZealand, Malaysia, Vietna
m, Cambodia, the Philippines, Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region. 







Corporate
and
Other
 
Much like
 our domestic resorts, our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities, the value of the experience offered to guests and thelocation
 of their resorts. We manage and own 50% of CityCenter, which includes Aria casino resort. Aria appeals to the upper end of each segment in the LasVegas
 market and competes with our domestic casino resorts and other resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Grand Victoria, our other unconsolidated affiliate, mainlycompetes for customers 
against casino resorts in the Chicago metropolitan market.5

  
Marketing
 
Our marketing efforts a
re conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and innewspapers

 through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques thatidentify
 customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, andhelp build lasting custome
r relationships. 
  
M
 life Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in bothgaming
 and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focusedcustomers,
 in addition to M life Rewards, at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure thatcustomers
 can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with ourcustomers, encouraging me
mbers to increase both visitation and spend.

 advantage as an employer and destination of choice for our global customer base. Our inclusion initiative at our resorts fosters employee engagement,individual
 responsibility,  team  collaboration,  leadership  competency,  high  performance  and  innovation.  Our  diversity  and  inclusion  initiative  has  been  widelyrecognized for many yea
rs through numerous awards and accolades. 
Philanthropy

and
community
engagement.
Our  host community and social investments are prioritized to strengthen the communities where our employeeslive,
 work and care for their families. Our community platform features three main programs: our Corporate Giving Program, our employee-driven MGM ResortsFoundation
 and our Employee Volunteer Program. Through these channels, we make financial and in-kind donations, contribute volunteer service and participatein
 civic and non-profit organizations and issues that advance the quality of life in our communities. Key investment areas include hunger relief, diversity, publiceducation, health and welln
ess and environmental sustainability. 
Environmental

sustainability.
We  continue  to  gain  recognition  for  our  comprehensive  environmental  responsibility  initiatives  in  energy  and  waterconservation,
 recycling  and  waste  management,  sustainable  supply  chain  and  green  building.  Certain  of  our  casino  resorts  in  Nevada  and  our  casino  resort  inMichigan
 were  the  first  in  each  state  to  earn  certification  from  Green  Key,  the  largest  international  program  evaluating  environmental  sustainability  in  hoteloperations.
 We received certifications at all of our domestic resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, Delano, and Mandalay Bay, Mirage,and MGM Grand Detroit have all re
ceived “Five Green Key,” the highest possible rating. Many major travel service providers recognize the Green Key designationand identify our resorts fo
r their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations.  
In
 addition,  we  believe  that  incorporating  the  tenets  of  environmental  sustainability  in  our  business  decisions  advances  a  platform  for  innovation  andoperational
 efficiency. CityCenter (Aria, Vdara, Veer and Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With sixLEED 
® Gold certifications from the U.S. Green Building Council (the “Council”), CityCenter serves as the standard for combining luxury and environmentalresponsibility
 within  the  large-scale  hospitality  industry.  Also,  MGM  National  Harbor,  The  Park,  and  T-Mobile  Arena  have  all  been  awarded  LEED ® Goldcertification by th
e Council. 
At
 MGM China,  we incorporate  the same  commitment  to environmental  preservation.  Our efforts  to improve  energy  efficiency,  indoor  air  quality,  andenvironmental
 stewardship have resulted in MGM China being included in the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Benchmark Index on the Hong Kong StockExchange. MGM Cotai, our new integrate
d resort, has achieved the China Green Building (Macau) Design label from the China Green Building and Energy Saving(Macau) Association.
 
The
 construction  of  MGM  Springfield  will  further  position  MGM  Resorts  as  a  leader  in  sustainable  resort  operations,  and  by  adopting  innovativetechnologies in the design and op
erating practices of this resort, we are advancing our commitment to protecting our planet in new regions. 
Development
and
Leveraging
Our
Brand
and
Management
Assets
 
In
 allocating  resources,  our  financial  strategy  is  focused  on  managing  a  proper  mix  of  investing  in  existing  resorts,  spending  on  new  resorts  and  otherdevelopments
 or initiatives and repaying long-term debt or returning capital to shareholders. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in newinitiatives and at our curre
nt resorts that will provide profitable returns. 
We
 regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets. Opportunities we evaluate may include theownership,
 management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada, or in states other than Nevada, or outside of the United States. Weleverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnershi
ps and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of ourbrands
 are well-suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation withone or more third parties.

 MGM
Springfield
 
We
 were  awarded  a  casino  license  to  build  and  operate  MGM  Springfield  in  Springfield,  Massachusetts.  MGM  Springfield  is  being  developed  onapproximately
 14  acres  of  land  in  downtown  Springfield.  Plans  for  the  resort  currently  include  a  casino  with  approximately  2,550  slots  and  120  table  gamesincluding
 poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,500-space parkinggarage,
 with an expected development and construction cost of approximately $960 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. Construction ofMGM Springfield is expected to be 
completed in the third quarter of 2018. 
Intellectual
Property
 
Our
 principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Bellagio, The Mirage, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGMResorts
 International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Circus Circus and Beau Rivage, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes inthe
 United  States.  In  addition,  we  have  also  registered  or  applied  to  register  numerous  other  trademarks  in  connection  with  our  properties,  facilities  anddevelopment
 projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties andservices.
 We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the namerecognition,
 reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration solong
 as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand developmentand identification, and 
enforcement of our trademark rights.
Employees
and
Labor
Relations
 
As
 of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 51,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically, of which 6,000 and 2,000, respectively,support
 the  Company’s  management  agreements  with  CityCenter.  In  addition,  we  had  approximately  9,000  employees  at  MGM  China.  We  had  collectivebargaining agreements
 with unions covering approximately 36,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2017. Collective bargaining agreements with three unionscovering
 a significant number of our employees in Las Vegas are scheduled to expire in the first half of 2018. We began negotiations with all three unions in thefirst
 quarter  of  2018.  In  addition,  Beau  Rivage  is  currently  engaged  in  negotiations  for  an  initial  collective  bargaining  agreement  with  a  council  of  unionsrepresenting
 various hotel and food and beverage constituencies, Borgata will be engaged in negotiations with three unions in 2018, and MGM National Harbor isin
 negotiations with one union. As of December 31, 2017, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a labor union and the resorts are not party to anycollective bargaining agreements.
 
Regulation
and
Licensing
 
The gaming
 industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subjectto
 extensive  regulation  under  the  laws,  rules  and  regulations  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which  it  is  located.  These  laws,  rules  and  regulations  generally  concern  theresponsibility,
 financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in onejurisdiction could resul
t in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.   
A
 more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, whichExhibit is incorporated he
rein by reference. 
Our
 businesses  are  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations  affecting  businesses  in  general.  These  laws  and  regulationsinclude,
 but  are  not  limited  to,  restrictions  and  conditions  concerning  alcoholic  beverages,  smoking,  employees,  currency  transactions,  taxation,  zoning  andbuilding
 codes (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations  to meet certain federal requirementsrelated
 to access and use by persons with disabilities) ,  construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in ouroperations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money launderin
g regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently inthe
 future,  or  new  laws  and  regulations  could  be  enacted.  Material  changes,  new  laws  or  regulations,  or  material  differences  in  interpretations  by  courts  orgovernmental authorit
ies could adversely affect our operating results. 
In
 addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean WaterAct,
 the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.Under
 various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation ofcertain
 hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for,the
 presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverseeffect on us or the resul
ts of our operations.8

 Paradise,  exercise  its  redemption  right  with  respect  to  the  subconcession,  or  refuse  to  grant  MGM  Grand  Paradise  an  extension  of  thesubconcession in 2020;
 
• the dependence of MGM Grand Paradise upon g aming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in Macau; 
• changes to fiscal and tax po licies; 
• our  ability to recognize our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and the variability of the valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred taxasset;

 ITEM
1A.
RISK
FACTORS  
You
 should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with theSEC
 could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully,among other things, the risks des
cribed below.
Risks
Relating
to
Our
Substantial
Indebtedness

 
• Our
substantial
indebtedness
and
significant
financial
commitments,
including
the
fixed
component
of
our
rent
payments
to
MGP,
could
adverselyaffect

our
operations
and
financial
results
and
impact
our
ability
to
satisfy
our
obligations
.  As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $13.0billion
 of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, including $373 million of borrowings outstanding and $1.1 billion of available borrowingcapacity
 under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility,  and  $2.3  billion  and  $2.1  billion  of  debt  outstanding  under  the  MGM  China  and  the  OperatingPartnership
 credit  facilities,  respectively.  In  addition,  the  Operating  Partnership  has  $1.9  billion  of  senior  notes  outstanding.  Any  increase  in  theinterest rates applicable to
 our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund ourother liquidity
 needs. We do not guarantee MGM China’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to theextent
 MGM  China  or  the  Operating  Partnership  were  to  cease  to  produce  cash  flow  sufficient  to  service  their  indebtedness,  our  ability  to  makeadditional investments 
into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior secured credit facility. 
In addition, our substantial 
indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including: 
 
• increasing our exposure to gen eral adverse economic and industry conditions; 
• limiting our flexibi lity to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; 
• limiting our  ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements,execution of our business stra
tegy or other general operating requirements; 
• making it more diffi cult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or 
• placing us at a competitive  disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors. 
Moreover,
 our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodicallyinvest
 significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished (and, under the master lease we are required to spend anaggregate
 amount  of  at  least  1%  of  actual  adjusted  net  revenues  from  the  properties  subject  to  the  master  lease  on  capital  expenditures  at  thoseproperties).
 Such  investments  require  an  ongoing  supply  of  cash  and,  to  the  extent  that  we  cannot  fund  expenditures  from  cash  generated  byoperations,
 funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including our development project in Massachusetts, andacquisitions
 could  require  significant  capital  commitments,  the  incurrence  of  additional  debt,  guarantees  of  third-party  debt,  or  the  incurrence  ofcontingent liabilit
ies, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
• Current
and
future
economic,
capital
and
credit
market
conditions
could
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
service
or
refinance
our
indebtedness
and
tomake

planned
expenditures
.  Our  ability  to  make  payments  on,  and  to  refinance,  our  indebtedness  and  to  fund  planned  or  committed  capitalexpenditures
 and investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates orsubsidiaries,
 including  CityCenter,  MGM  China  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  borrow  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  or  incur  newindebtedness.
 If regional and national economic conditions deteriorate  we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable  todecreases
 in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and otherrestrictive
 covenants in our debt instruments. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or continue toreceive
 distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, including CityCenter, MGM China and the Operating Partnership. We cannotassure
 you  that  future  borrowings  will  be  available  to  us  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  enable  us  to  pay  ourindebtedness
 or to fund our other liquidity needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrowadditional indebtedness on t
erms that are favorable to us. 
We
 have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2019, and thereafter. Our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in thefuture
 will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis,we
 might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is noassurance that any of thes
e alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or onterms that would not requir
e us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.

• The
agreements
governing
our
senior
secured
credit
facility
and
other
senior
indebtedness
contain
restrictions
and
limitations
that
could
significantlya
ffect
our
ability
to
operate
our
business,
as
well
as
significantly
affect
our
liquidity,
and
therefore
could
adversely
affect
our
results
of
operations
. Covenants governi
ng our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, am ong other things, our ability to:  
 
• pay dividends or distributions, r epurchase or issue equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments; 
• incur additional debt;  
• incur liens on assets;  
• sell assets or consolidat e with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets; 
• enter into transact ions with affiliates; 
• allow certain subsidiaries  to transfer assets; and 
• enter into sale and le ase-back transactions. 
Our
 ability  to  comply  with  these  provisions  may  be  affected  by  events  beyond  our  control.  The  breach  of  any  such  covenants  or  obligations  nototherwise
 waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which inturn
 could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, our senior secured credit facility requiresus
 to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interestcoverage
 ratio. Any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, ourfinancial condition, our 
results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt. 
In
 addition, MGM Grand Paradise and MGM China are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the Operating Partnership is aborrower
 under  its  senior  secured  credit  facility,  all  of  which  contain  covenants  that  restrict  the  respective  borrower’s  ability  to  engage  in  certaintransactions. In particular, these credit agreements require MGM China and the Operating Partnership to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose
certain
 operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries (including, with respect to MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise).These
 restrictions  include,  among  other  things,  limitations  on  their  ability  to  pay  dividends  or  distributions  to  us,  incur  additional  debt,  makeinvestments or engage in oth
er businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or sell assets.

changes
. For the second lease
 year commencing April 1, 2017, we were required to make annual rent payments of $662 million under the master lease.  In  October 2017,subsequent
 to MGP’s acquisition of MGM National Harbor’s real property, annual rent payments under the master lease increased to $757 million,prorated
 for the remainder of the second lease year .  The master lease also provides for fixed annual escalators of 2% on the base rent in the secondthrough
 sixth years and the possibility for additional 2% increases thereafter subject to the tenant meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as wellas
 potential increases in percentage rent in year six and every five years thereafter based on a percentage of average actual annual net revenue duringthe
 preceding five year period. As a result, our ability to fund our own operations, raise capital, make acquisitions, make investments, service our debtand otherwise respond to compet
itive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the master lease may: 
 
• make it more diffi cult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;  
• increase our vulnerabi lity to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business; 
• require  us  to  dedicate  a  substantial  portion  of  our  cash  flow  from  operations  to  making  rent  payments,  thereby  reducing  theavailability
 of  our  cash  flow  to  fund  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  development  projects  and  other  general  corporatepurposes;
 
• limit our flexibil ity in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  
• restrict our ability to make ac quisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and 
• cause us to lose our rights with respect to all of the properties leased under the master lease if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise
 default on the master lease, given that all of the properties we lease from MGP under the master lease are effectivelycross-collateralized as a result 
of the master lease being a single unitary lease. 
Any of the above factors could hav
e a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Risks
Related
to
our
Business
 
 
• We
face
significant
competition
with
respect
to
destination
travel
locations
generally
and
with
respect
to
our
peers
in
the
industries
in
which
wecompete,

and
failure
to
compete
effectively
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations
and
cash
flow
. The
 hotel, resort and casino industries are highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, andhotel,
 resort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotelroom
 capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants,may
 also expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas,Macau
 or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outsideLas Vegas, including California, h
as increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. 
In
 addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  result  in  the  addition  of  new  gamingestablishments
 located  closer  to  our  customers  than  our  casinos.  For  example,  while  our  Macau  operations  compete  to  some  extent  with  casinoslocated
 elsewhere  in or near  Asia, certain  countries  in the region  have legalized  casino  gaming  (including  Japan) and others  (such as Taiwan andThailand)
 may legalize  casino  gaming  (or online  gaming)  in the future  (including,  for example,  a recent  proposal by China to allow gambling  onHainan
 Island).  Furthermore,  currently  MGM  Grand  Paradise  holds  one  of  only  six  gaming  concessions  authorized  by  the  Macau  government  tooperate
 casinos  in  Macau.  If  the  Macau  government  were  to  allow  additional  competitors  to  operate  in  Macau  through  the  grant  of  additionalconcessions or if current 
concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities, we would face increased competition.   
Most jurisdictions where cas
ino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses.Although
 a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some casesnew gaming operations may be
 restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities(which
 may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including Nevada and New Jersey, have alsolegalized
 forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions, including Illinois, have legalized video gaming terminals. The expansion of online gamingand
 other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in ourcasino resorts.
 
In
 addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which weoperate.
 Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, results of opera
tions and cash flow. 
 
• Our
businesses
are
subject
to
extensive
regulation
and
the
cost
of
compliance
or
failure
to
comply
with
such
regulations
may
adversely
affect
ourbusiness

and
results
of
operations
.  Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states andprovinces
 in which we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility,financial
 stability  and character  of the owners and managers  of gaming operations  as well as persons financially  interested  or involved  in gamingoperations.
 As  such,  our  gaming  regulators  can  require  us  to  disassociate  ourselves  from  suppliers  or  business  partners  found  unsuitable  by  theregulators
 or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreignunconsolidated
 affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. Theregulatory
 environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our resultsof operations.
 In addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time by various federal, state, local andforeign
 legislatures and officials. Increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results. For a summary of gaming and other regulationsthat affect our business, s
ee “Regulation and Licensing” and Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Further,
 our directors, officers, key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatoryauthorities.
 If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with thatperson
 or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations intothe
 conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Certain public andprivate issuances of secu
rities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities. 
14

 In Macau,
 current laws and regulations co ncerning  gaming and gaming concessions are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent onthe
 interpretation of these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an
 interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, whichcould
 have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In  addition, MGM China’s activities in Macau aresubject
 to administrative  review  and approval by various  government  agencies.  We cannot  assure  you that  MGM China will be able  to obtain  allnecessary
 approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect  its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress tothe courts with respect to 
administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues. 
In
 addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general.These laws and regulations inc
lude, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking,employees,
 currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. For instance, we are subject to certain federal,state
 and  local  environmental  laws,  regulations  and  ordinances,  including  the  Clean  Air  Act,  the  Clean  Water  Act,  the  Resource  ConservationRecovery Act, the Comprehensive Envi
ronmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal,state and
 local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation ofcertain
 hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or isresponsible
 for, the presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, ornew
 laws and regulations could be enacted. For example, Illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants,work
 places, schools and casinos. Similarly, in October 2014, casinos in Macau, including MGM China, implemented a smoking ban which prohibitssmoking on all mass market g
aming floors and, in 2015, the Macau Health Bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposinga
 full smoking ban in casinos, including in VIP rooms. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in thefuture cannot be predic
ted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance. 
We
 also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money
 laundering  laws  and regulations.  For instance,  we  are  subject  to regulation  under  the Currency  and Foreign Transactions  Reporting  Act of1970,
 commonly known as the “Bank Secrecy Act,” which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) anycurrency
 transactions  in  excess  of  $10,000  that  occur  within  a  24-hour  gaming  day,  including  identification  of  the  individual(s)  involved  in  thecurrency
 transaction. We are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, amongother
 things, involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business orlawful
 purpose. In addition, under the Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping andretention.
 Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change orcould
 be  interpreted  differently  in  the  future,  or  new  laws  and  regulations  could  be  enacted.  Any  violations  of  the  anti-money  laundering  laws,including the Bank Secrecy Act, or 
regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations orcash flows.
 
 
• Our
business
is
affected
by
economic
and
market
conditions
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
and
in
the
locations
in
which
our
customers
reside.
 Our  business  is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  andbusiness
 development. Economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditionsmay
 cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. In addition,changes
 in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable jobmarket,
 perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or otheracts
 of violence. Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, haveresulted
 in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences ofconsumers
 and timely react to these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. Aria, Bellagio and MGM GrandLas
 Vegas in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions inthe
 United States, and California in particular. A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers orcorporations
 generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect our operating results. For example, theprior recession and downturn in consu
mer and corporate spending had a negative impact on our results of operations. 
15

 In
 addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau from mainland China, general economic and market conditions
 in  China  could  impact  our  financial  prospects.  Any  slowdown  in  economic  growth  or  changes  to  China’s  current  restrictions  on  travel  andcurrency
 conversion  or  movements,  including  market  impacts  resulting  from  China’s  recent  anti-corruption  campaign  a nd  related  tightening  ofliquidity
 provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals andother
 ATM limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government), could dis rupt  the number of visitors from mainland China to MGMMacau
 and/or the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino. For example, from 2008 through 2010, China readjusted its visa policy towardMacau
 and  limited  the  number  of  visits  that  some  mainland Chinese  citizens  may  make  to  Macau  in  a  given  time  period.  In  addition,  effectiveOctober
 2013, China banned “zero ‑ fare” tour groups involving no or low up-front payments and compulsory shopping, which were popular amongvisitors
 to Macau from mainland Chi na,  and in December  2014 the Chinese government  tightened  the enforcement  of visa transit  rules for thoseseeking
 to enter Macau at the Gongbei border (including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country, a visa issued by such destination
 country and a valid Chinese passport). Most  recently, in July 2017, the Chinese government, along with Macau authorities, implemented newfacial
 recognition  technology on ATM machines  in Macau to strictly  enforce  the “know you r
 customer” regulatio ns  for mainland Chinese bankcardholders. 
It  is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. Thesedevelopments
 have had, and any future policy developments that may be impl emented  may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors toMacau from mainland China, whi
ch could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.Furthermore,
 our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources. Our success in Macau will be impacted by ourability
 to retain and hire employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that suchcompetition
 will grow in light of new developments in Macau. While we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts, certainMacau
 government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we onlyhire
 Macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause laborcosts
 to  increase.  Finally,  because  additional  casino  projects  are  under  construction  and  are  to  be  developed  in  the  future,  existing  transportationinfrastructure may
 need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate tomeet the demands of an in
creased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the resultsof operations at our develop
ment in Cotai, Macau, could be negatively impacted. 
 
• We 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
sustain 
our 
continuous 
improvement 
efforts.
In  2015,  we  commenced  an  initiative  for  sustained  growth  and  marginenhancement, focused
 on improving our business processes to optimize scale for greater efficiency and lower costs throughout our business. While we believe
 these initiatives will continue to result in Adjusted EBITDA benefit, our optimization efforts may fail to achieve expected results or we maynot
 be  able  to  sustain  our  historic  efforts  to  produce  continuous  improvements.  In  addition,  while  we  expect  to  continue  to  explore  additionalopportunities
 to drive further improvement to our business processes, we may not be able to achieve the historic Adjusted EBITDA benefits at thesame
 rate  (or  at  all)  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  institutionalize  the  continuous  improvement  business  practices  that  developed  in  connection  withimplementing the Profi
t Growth Plan.

We  intend to payongoing
 regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. However, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount orfrequency
 of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants inour
 credit  agreement,  and  because  we  are  a  holding  company  with  no  material  direct  operations,  we  are  dependent  on  receiving  cash  from  ouroperating
 subsidiaries  to  generate  the  funds  from  operations  necessary  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock.  We  expect  our  subsidiaries  willcontinue
 to generate significant cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock; however, their ability to generatefunds
 will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, any applicable provisions of state law that may limit theamount
 of  funds  available  to  us,  and  compliance  with  covenants  and  financial  ratios  related  to  existing  or  future  agreements  governing  anyindebtedness
 at  such  subsidiaries  and  any  limitations  in  other  agreements  such  subsidiaries  may  have  with  third  parties.  In  addition,  each  of  thecompanies
 in our corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. As aconsequence
 of these various limitations  and restrictions, future dividend payments may be reduced or eliminated. Any change in the level of ourdividends or the suspension of the pay

 We lease eleven of our 16

  
destination  resorts and The Park from a subsidiary  of MGP pursuant to the master lease. The master lease has a term of ten years with up to fouradditional
 five year extensions, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The master lease is commonly known as a triple-net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are
 required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required in connection with theleased
 properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or wi th  respect to the leased properties (other than taxes onthe
 income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and thebusiness conducted
 on the leased propertie s.  We are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits receivedin exchange for such costs shall accrue
 in part to MGP as owner of the associated facilities. In addition, if some of our leased facilities should p rove to be
 unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations, or if we should otherwise decide to exit a particular property, wewould
 remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease even if we d ecided  to cease operations at those locationsunless
 we are able to transfer the rights with respect to a particular property in accordance with the requirements of the master lease. Our ability totransfer
 our obligations under the master lease to a third -party  with respect to individual properties, should we decide to withdraw from a particularlocation,
 is limited to non-Las Vegas properties and no more than two Las Vegas gaming properties, and is subject to identifying a willing third-partywho
 meets th e  requirements for a transferee set forth in the master lease. We may be unable to find an appropriate transferee willing   to assume theobligations
 under  the  master  lease  with  respect  to  any  such  property.  In  addition,  we  could  incur  special  charges  relati ng  to  the  closing  of  suchfacilities
 including  sublease  termination  costs,  impairment  charges  and  other  special  charges  that  would  reduce  our  net  income  and  could  have  amaterial adverse

• Despite

must
be
approvedin
accordance
with
certain

specified
procedures,
which
could
affect
our
ability
to
execute
our
operational
and
strategic
objectives.

We own the single outstanding
 Class B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits orlosses or
 any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP, and which represents a majority of thevoting power of
 MGP’s shares so long as the holder of the Class B share and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownershipof
 the  combined  economic  interests  in  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership  does  not  fall  below  30%.  We,  therefore,  have  the  ability  to  exercisesignificant control ove
r MGP’s affairs, including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to MGP’s shareholders for approval. 
MGP’s
 operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (otherthan
 MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by MGP’sboard
 of directors  in respect  of such conflict  of interest  shall  be conclusively  deemed to be fair  and reasonable  to MGP if it is (i)  approved  by amajority of a confli
cts committee which17

 consists
 solely  of  “independent”  directors  (which  MGP  refers  to  as  “Special  Approval”)  (such  independence  determined in  accordance  with  theNYSE’s
 listing standards, the standards established by the Exchange Act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additionalindependence
 requirements  in  our  operating  agreement),  (ii)  determined  by  MGP’s  boa rd  of  directors  to  be  fair  and  reasonable  to  MGP  or  (iii)approved by
 the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting sharesowned by us
 and our affiliates). Furthermore, M GP’s operating agreement  provides that any transaction with a value, individually or in the aggregate,over
 $25 million between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on theo 
ther hand (any such transaction (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries) under any of thematerial
 agreements  entered  into  on  the  closing  day  of  MGP’s  formation  transactions),  a  “Threshold  Tran saction”),  shall  be  permitted  only  if  (i)Special
 Approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power ofMGP’s outstanding voting shares (exclud
ing voting shares owned by us and our affiliates).  
As a result, certain transactions, including any Threshol
d Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could have significant benefit tous may require Special
 Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from aconflicts
 committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. Thefailure to obtain such r
equisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.

 MGM Grand Paradise and the Macau government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise’s compliance with, a provision ofthe
 subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the Macau government. During anyconsultation
 or  negotiation,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  obligated  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  the  subconcession  contract  as  interpreted  by  theMacau
 government.  Currently,  there  is  no  precedent  concerning  how  the  Macau  government  will  treat  the  termination  of  a  concession  orsubconcession upon
 the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. The loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conductinggaming operations in Macau, whi
ch would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
In
 addition, the subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020. Unless the subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion ofcasino
 premises is amended, all of MGM Grand Paradise’s casino premises and gaming-related equipment will automatically be transferred to theMacau
 government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. Beginning onApril 20,
 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice. In the event the Macaugovernment
18

 exercises
 t his  redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnitywill
 be  determined  based  on  the  amount  of  gaming  and  non-gaming  revenue  generated  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  excluding  the  conv ention  andexhibition facilities, during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, depreciation and amortization, multiplied by the number
of
 remaining years before expiration of the subconcession. We cannot assure you that MGM G rand  Paradise will be able to renew or extend thesubconcession
 contract on terms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. We also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, thecompensation paid to MGM Grand Paradis
e will be adequate to co mpensate for the loss of fu ture revenues. 
 
• MGM
Grand
Paradise
is
dependent
upon
gaming
promoters
for
a
significant
portion
of
gaming
revenues
in
Macau
. Gaming promoters, who promote gaming
 and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming revenues in Macau. Withthe
 rise in gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operatedby
 licensed gaming promoters, the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased. While MGM Grand Paradise is undertakinginitiatives
 to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain, or grow, relationships withgaming
 promoters. In addition, continued reductions in, and new regulations governing, the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure ofadditional
 VIP rooms in Macau,  including VIP rooms at MGM Macau.  If MGM Grand Paradise  is unable to maintain  or grow relationships  withgaming
 promoters, or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our high-end customers (or if, as a result of recentmarket
 conditions in Macau, gaming promoters encounter difficulties attracting patrons to come to Macau or experience decreased liquidity limitingtheir
 ability to grant credit to patrons), MGM Grand Paradise’s ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered. Furthermore, if existing VIP roomsat
 MGM Macau are closed there can be no assurance that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such VIProoms in the future in
 a timely manner, or at all. 
In
 addition,  the  quality  of  gaming  promoters  is  important  to  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  and  our  reputation  and  ability  to  continue  to  operate  incompliance
 with gaming licenses. While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure youthat
 the  gaming  promoters  with  whom  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  or  becomes  associated  will  meet  the  high  standards  insisted  upon.  If  a  gamingpromoter
 falls below MGM Grand Paradise’s standards, MGM Grand Paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gamingregulators with authority ov
er our operations. 
We also grant credit 
lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact therecoverability of th
ese loans. 
 
• We
are
subject
to
taxation
by
various
governments
and
agencies
and
the
rate
of
taxation
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
could
change
in
thefuture.
We are subject to tax by v arious governments and agencies, both in the U.S. and in Macau. Changes in the rates of taxation, the amount of taxeswe
 owe  and  the  time  when  income  is  subject  to  taxation,  the  Macau  income  tax  exemption  or  the  imposition  of  foreign  withholding  taxes  couldincrease
 our overall rate of taxation. Any of these changes could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
 
 
• The
future
recognition
of
our

is
uncertain,
and
the
amount
of
valuation
allowance
we
may
apply
against
suchdeferred

tax
asset
may
change
materially
in

periods.
We  currently  have  significant  deferred  tax  assets  resulting  from  foreign  tax  creditcarryforwards
 that are available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred taxasset for recoverabi
lity and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. Thisevaluation
 is based on all available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits and our initial interpretations of the U.S.Tax
 Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (the  “Tax  Act”)  in  the  absence  of  regulatory  or  other  clarifying  guidance.  As  a  result,  significant  judgment  is  required  inassessing the
 possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance witha corresponding impact on th
e provision for income taxes in the period including such change. 
 
• Extreme
weather
conditions
or
climate
change
may
cause
property
damage
or
interrupt
business,
which
could
harm
our
business
and
results
ofoperations
.  Certain of our casino properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to,hurricanes
 in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties,and reduce the number of cus
tomers who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or othercause
 of water shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adverselyaffect
 our business and results of operations. Although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extremeweather
 conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for businessinterruption, and we cannot assu
re you that19

  
we  will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims re sulting  from such extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, suchextreme weather
 conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for anindefinite period, which would hav
e a ma terial adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
• Because
a
majority
of
our
major
gaming
resorts
are
concentrated
on
the
Las
Vegas
Strip,
we
are
subject
to
greater
risks
than
a
gaming
company
thatis

more
geographically
diversified
.  Given  that  a  majority  of  our  major  resorts  are  concentrated  on  the  Las  Vegas  Strip,  our  business  may  besignificantly
 affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of anyevents that
 disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or fromLas
 Vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices orlower demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate high
way between Las Vegas and SouthernCalifornia,
 where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect thenumber of customers who visit our 
facilities. 
 
• We
extend
credit
to
a
large
portion
of
our
customers
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
collect
gaming
receivables
.  We conduct a portion of our gamingactivities
 on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markersthan
 slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is morevolatile
 than  other  forms  of  gaming,  and  variances  in  win-loss  results  attributable  to  high-end  gaming  may  have  a  significant  positive  or  negativeimpact
 on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-endcustomers could
 have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customerswhose
 level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. In addition, MGM Grand Paradise extendscredit
 to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers andgaming promoters could have 
a significant impact on our results of operations. 
While
 gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgmentson
 gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine thatenforcement of
 gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in theU.S.
 of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts ofmany foreign nations.
 
Furthermore,
 we expect that MGM Macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To theextent
 MGM Macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM Macau may not have access to a forum in which itwill
 be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGMMacau
 may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. Moreover, under applicable law, MGM Macau remains obligated to pay taxes onuncollectible winnings fro
m customers. 
Even
 where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impacton our operating results.
 
 
• We
may
incur
impairments
to
goodwill,
indefinite-lived
intangible
assets,
or
long-lived
assets
which
could
negatively
affect
our
future
profits
.  Wereview
 our  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  long-lived  assets  on  an  annual  basis  and  during  interim  reporting  periods  in  accordance  with  theauthoritative
 guidance. Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack ofgrowth
 have resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairmentcharges
 or write-downs may be required in future periods. For instance, in 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion to reducethe historical
 carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a materi
al adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.

, such
as

acts
ofviolence
or
acts
of

ty
. We are  dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of our customers travel by air toour
 Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceivedthreat
 to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, although wehave
 been  able  to  purchase  some  insurance  coverage  for  certain  types  of  terrorist  acts,  insurance  coverage  against  loss  or  business  interruptionresulting from war and some 
forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.20

  
 
• Co-investing
in
our
properties,
including
our
investment
in
CityCenter,
decreases
our
ability
to
manage
risk
.  In addition to acquiring or developinghotels and
 resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest,as
 a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property. Therefore, the operation of such properties is subject toinherent
 risk  due  to  the  shared  nature  of  the  enterprise  and  the  need  to  reach  agreements  on  material  matters.  In  addition,  investments  with  otherinvestors
 may  involve  risks  such  as  the  possibility  that  the  co-investor  might  become  bankrupt  or  not  have  the  financial  resources  to  meet  itsobligations,
 or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take actioncontrary to our instructions or
 requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject hotels and resortsowned
 by such entities to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors. Alternatively, our co-investors
 could take actions binding on the property without our consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liablefor its share of liabilities.
 
For instance,
 CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its businessand its ability to mee
t its obligations. If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support futurefunding
 requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us. In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter’sindebtedness
 subject CityCenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incuradditional
 indebtedness,  place  liens  upon  assets,  make  distributions  to  us,  make  certain  investments,  consummate  certain  asset  sales,  enter  intotransactions with affiliates (including us)
 and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose ofall
 or  substantially  all  of  its  assets.  The  CityCenter  credit  facility  also  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that  require  CityCenter  to  maintain  amaximum
 total net leverage ratio (as defined in CityCenter’s credit facility) for each quarter. We cannot be sure that CityCenter will be able to meetthis test in the future o
r that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test. 
 
• Any
of
our
future
construction,
development
or
expansion
projects
will
be
subject
to
significant
development
and
construction
risks,
which
could
havea
material
adverse
impact
on
related
pro
ject
timetables,
costs
and
our
ability
to
complete
the
projects
.  
Any of our future construction, dev
elopment or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks, including: 
 
• lack of sufficient, or d elays in the availability of, financing; 
• changes to plans and specifi cations; 
• engineering problems, inc luding defective plans and specifications; 
• shortages of, and price inc reases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets; 
• delays in obtaining or inabi lity to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; 
• changes  in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation  and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure,residential, real 
estate development or construction projects; 
• labor disputes or work stoppages;  
• availability of qualified contract ors and subcontractors; 
• disputes with and defaults by cont ractors and subcontractors; 
• personal injuries to workers and other persons; 
• environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses; 
• weather interferen ces or delays; 
• fires, typhoons and other natur al disasters; 
• geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and 
• other unanticipated circumstance s or cost increases. 
The
 occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction,  development,expansion
 or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake. For instance, we currently expectthe
 total development costs of our Cotai project to be approximately $3.4 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalizedinterest
 and  land-related  costs,  and  we  currently  expect  total  development  costs  of  our  Massachusetts  project  to  be  approximately  $960  million,excluding
 capitalized  interest  and  land-related  costs.  While  we  believe  that  the  overall  budgets  for  these  developments  are  reasonable,  thesedevelopment
 costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected. We cannot guarantee that our construction costs ortotal
 project costs for future projects, including our development in Massachusetts, will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted or that theexpected design and featu
res of current or future projects will not21

 change.
 In  additio n,  the  regulatory  approvals  associated  with  our  development  projects  may  require  us  to  open  future  casino  resorts  by  a  certainspecified
 time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to
 open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on ourresults of operations and f
inancial condition. 
We
 also  make  significant  capital  expenditures  to  maintain  and  upgrade  our  resorts,  which  may  disrupt  operations  and  displace  revenue  at  theproperties, including rev
enue lost while rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service. 
 
• We

Commission.
If
we

Pursuant  to the Gaming Act, we are required to commence gaming operations at MGM Springfield no later than September 2019, oneyear
 from the opening date approved by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (the “MGC”). If MGM Springfield fails to begin gaming operationsby
 September 2019 or receive an extension, MGM Springfield is subject to suspension or revocation of its gaming license by the MGC and may, afterbeing
 found by the MGC after a hearing to have acted in bad faith in its application, be assessed a fine of up to $50,000,000. Failure to meet thedeadline could have an adve

• Our
insurance
coverage
may
not
be
adequate
to
cover
all
possible
losses
that
our
properties
could
suffer.
In
addition,
our
insurance
costs
mayincrease

and
we
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
similar
insurance
coverage
in
the
future
.  Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for ouroperating properties,
 which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism or other acts of violence),each
 policy  has  certain  exclusions.  In  addition,  our  property  insurance  coverage  is  in  an  amount  that  may  be  significantly  less  than  the  expectedreplacement cost of
 rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in theevent
 of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation ofroom reservations or conventions due to
 fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackoutsor
 otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain actscould expose us to substantial uninsu
red losses. 
In
 addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject toclaims
 by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurancemay not be adequate to cove
r all losses in any such event. 
We
 renew our insurance policies (other than our builder’s risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we mayneed to further reduce ou
r policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. 
 
• Any

to
protect
our

names
and
adversely
affect
our
business
.  Thedevelopment
 of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of oursuccess.
 While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or otherintellectual
 property,  we  seek  to  establish  and  maintain  our  proprietary  rights  in  our  business  operations  through  the  use  of  trademarks.  We  fileapplications for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countrie
s where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despiteour
 efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of someforeign
 countries  do  not  protect  proprietary  rights  to  as  great  an  extent  as  the  laws  of  the  United  States.  Monitoring  the  unauthorized  use  of  ourintellectual
 property is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of theproprietary rights
 of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the stepswe
 have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others.The
 unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages orgoodwill, which could adversely af

• We
are
subject
to
risks
associated
with
doing
business
outside
of
the
United
States
 . Our operations outside of the  United States are subject to risks thatare
 inherent in conducting business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs. In particular, the risks associated with the operation ofMGM Macau or any f 
uture operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include: 
 
• changes in laws and policies th at govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions; 
• changes in non-United States govern ment programs; 
• possible  failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt PracticesAct and similar anti-b
ribery laws in other jurisdictions; 
• general economic condi tions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements; 
• difficulty in establ ishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations; 
• different labor regulations;  
• changes in environmental, h ealth and safety laws; 
• outbreaks of diseases or epid emics; 
• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; 
• political instability and actual  or anticipated military and political conflicts; 
• economic instability and i nflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and 
• uncertainties rega rding judicial systems and procedures. 
These risks, individually or in 
the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
We
 are  also  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks,  including  the  effects  of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  If  the  United  States  dollarstrengthens in
 relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in thecurrencies of other such 
countries will decrease. 
 
• Any
violation
of
the
Foreign
Corrupt
Practices
Act
or
any
other
similar
anti-corruption
laws
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
us
. A significant portion of our
 revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border
 business and in each of the countries  in which we transact  business. We are subject to compliance  with the United States Foreign CorruptPractices
 Act (“FCPA”) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improperpayments
 to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to complywith
 these  laws,  we  cannot  be  sure  that  our  internal  policies  and  procedures  will  always  protect  us  from  violations  of  these  laws,  despite  ourcommitment
 to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal andcivil
 sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of theFCPA.
 The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, andresults of operations.
 
 
• We
face
risks
related
to
pending
claims
that
have
been
, or
future
claims
that
may
be
, brought
against
us
.  Claims have been brought against us andour
 subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense orprosecution
 of  our  current  or  future  legal  proceedings,  which  could  result  in  settlements  or  damages  that  could  significantly  impact  our  business,financial
 condition, results of operations and reputation. Please see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12 in the accompanyingconsolidated financia

• A
significant
portion
of
our
labor
force
is
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements.
Work
stoppages
and  other labor problems could negativelyaffect
 our business and results of operations. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 36,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargainingagreements.
 The collective bargaining agreements covering most of our Las Vegas union employees expire in 2018. A prolonged dispute with thecovered
 employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverseimpact
 on  our  operations.  Further,  adverse  publicity  in  the  marketplace  related  to  union  messaging  could  further  harm  our  reputation  and  reducecustomer demand
 for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have anadverse
 impact  on  our  results  of  operations.  For  instance,  Beau  Rivage  is  currently  engaged  in  negotiations  for  an  initial  collective  bargainingagreement
 with a council of unions representing various hotel and food and beverage constituencies, Borgata will be engaged in negotiations withthree
 unions  in  2018,  and  MGM National  Harbor  is  in  negotiations  with  one  union . In addition, to the extent that our non-union employees  joinunions,
 we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems. Furthermore, we may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employerplans that
 are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or “critical” status. For instance, Borgata’s most significant plan as of December 31,2017 is the Legacy Plan of the Nation
al Retirement Fund, which has23

  
been  listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded statusthrough
 a funding improvement or rehabilitation p lan,  which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of asurcharge
 on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from theseplans, a w 
ithdrawal in  the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over aperiod of time) that would v
ary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such add itional costs may be signi ficant. 
 
• Our
business
is
particularly
sensitive
to

and
a
rise
in

 with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products,properties
 and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance
 by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security onsystems
 storing our data may result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use ortransfer
 of  data.  We  rely  on  proprietary  and  commercially  available  systems,  software,  tools  and  monitoring  to  provide  security  for  processing,transmission
 and storage of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our datasecurity
 measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threatsincluding,
 but not limited to, computer malware, viruses, and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties. In addition, while we maintain cyber riskinsurance to assist in the 
cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient .  
We also rely
 extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availabilityof
 our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and theresults
 of  operations.  For  instance,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  criminal  cyber  security  attacks  against  companies  where  customer  and  companyinformation has
 been compromised and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and records, including those we maintain with ourthird-party
 service providers, may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information system service providersface
 risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations. A significanttheft,
 loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on ourreputation,
 cause a material disruption to our operations and management team, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigationby customers and other part
ies whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, resultsof operations and cash flows.
 
 
• We
are
subject
to
risks
related
to
corporate
social
responsibility
and
reputation.
Many  factors influence our reputation and the value of our brandsincluding
 the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our businessfaces
 increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands ifwe fail
 to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity and inclusion,workplace
 conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagementand
 retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations and c
ash flows.

• We
may
seek
to
expand
through
investments
in
other
businesses
and
properties
or
through
alliances
or
acquisitions,
and
we
may
also
seek
to
divestsome

of
our
properties
and
other
assets,
any
of
which
may
be
unsuccessful
.  We intend to consider strategic and compl ementary  acquisitions andinvestments
 in  other  businesses,  properties  or  other  assets.  Furthermore,  we  may  pursue  any  of  these  opportunities  in  alliance  with  third  parties,including
 MGP. Acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well  as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect ourbusiness, including risks rela
ted to: 
 
• spending cash and incurring debt;  
• assuming contingent liabi lities; 
• unanticipated issues in in tegrating information, communications and other systems; 
• unanticipated incompa tibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods; 
• retaining key employees ; and 
• consolidating corporate a nd administrative infrastructures. 
We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transaction
s on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we willactually
 realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate newassets
 and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs, competitive responses, loss or customer or otherbusiness relationships and the d
iversion of management attention. 
In
 addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement ourbusiness,
 are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we mayattempt
 to  sell  these  identified  properties  and  assets.  There  can  be  no  assurance,  however,  that  we  will  be  able  to  complete  dispositions  oncommercially reasonable terms or at
 all. 
 
• If
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
increase
gaming
taxes
and
fees
, our
results
could
be
adversely
affected
. State and local authorities raise asignificant
 amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities.  From time to time, legislators  and government  officials have proposedchanges
 in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budgetdeficits may intensi
fy such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gamingtaxes
 or  fees,  depending  on  the  magnitude  of  the  increase  and  any  offsetting  factors,  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  bematerially adversely affected.
 For instance, income generated from gaming operations of MGM Grand Paradise currently has the benefit of a corporatetax
 exemption  in Macau, which exempts us from paying the 12% complementary  tax on profits generated by the operation  of casino games. Thisexemption
 is effective through March 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of the current gaming subconcession. Due to theuncertainty
 concerning  taxation  after  the  subconcession  renewal  process,  we  cannot  assure  you  that  any  extensions  of  the  tax  exemption  will  begranted beyond March 31, 2020.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS  
October
1
litigation.
The  Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the October 1, 2017shooting
 in Las Vegas. The matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues, in each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seekingdamages
 for emotional distress, physical injury, medical expenses, economic damages and/or wrongful death based on assertions that the Company and/or certainof
 its subsidiaries were negligent. Lawsuits were first filed in October 2017 and include actions filed by multiple individuals in the District Court of Clark County,Nevada and
 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. Some of the original actions have been voluntarily dismissed, and plaintiffs’ counsel indicatethey anticipate re-filing the la
wsuits in similar form. Additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future. 
We
 are currently unable to reliably predict the developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of pending or future litigationrelated
 to this matter. We will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses, and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events, new information andfuture
 circumstances. We intend to defend against these lawsuits and ultimately believe we should prevail, but litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable.Although
 there  are  significant  procedural,  factual  and  legal  issues  to  be  resolved  that  could  significantly  affect  our  belief  as  to  the  possibility  of  liability,  wecurrently
 believe that it is reasonably possible that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. The foregoing determination was made inaccordance
 with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  as  codified  in  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (“ASC”)  450-20,  and  is  not  an  admission  of  anyliability on the part o
f us or any of our affiliates. Given that these cases are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, we do not currentlypossess
 sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability. In the event we incur any liability, we believe it is unlikely we would incurlosses
 in connection with these claims in excess of our insurance coverage. In addition, our general liability insurance coverage provides, as part of the contractual“duty
 to defend”, payment of legal fees and associated costs incurred to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the October 1, 2017 shooting in LasVegas.
 Payment of such fees and costs is in addition to (and not limited by) the limits of the insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverageavailable. The insurance carriers have not expressed any reservation of rights or coverage defenses that indicate they disp
ute coverage under the applicable policies.
27

 Other.
We  and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. We do notbelieve that the outco
me of such pending litigation, conside red in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSI ON
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND
RES
ULTS
OF
OPERATIONS Executive
Overview
Our
 primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resortamenities.
 We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage.Most
 of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on theability
 of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. Wemake
 significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new featuresand amenities.
During
 the year ended December 31, 2017, Las Vegas visitor volume decreased 2%, Las Vegas Strip REVPAR increased 2% and Las Vegas Strip gamingrevenue
 increased by 1% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Results ofoperations
 for  our  domestic  resorts  during  2017  benefited  from  an  increase  in  operating  margins  resulting  from  increases  in  gaming  revenue  and  REVPAR,discussed
 below. Our rooms revenue benefited from robust convention business at our Las Vegas Strip resorts, which allowed us to yield higher room rates acrossour portfolio of resorts.
Gross
 gaming revenue in the Macau market increased 19% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of growth on the Cotai Strip. Additionally,according
 to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, visitor arrivals increased 5% and overnight visitors increased 10%in 
2017  compared  to  2016.  As  a  significant  number  of  MGM  Macau’s  customers  are  from  mainland  China,  we  believe  operating  results  at  MGM  Macau  areaffected
 by economic conditions in mainland China as well as certain policy initiatives enacted in mainland China and Macau. We believe a slowdown in China’seconomic
 growth rate as well as the implementation of policies related to gaming promoters, the Chinese government’s restrictions on travel to Macau and cross-border
 currency transactions led to a multi-year decrease in gross gaming revenues for the Macau market, which lasted through the first half of 2016 and primarilyimpacted
 VIP  casino  gaming  operations  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  main  floor  operations  throughout  the  Macau  market.  Despite  the  impact  of  these  events  andconcerns
 over  the  sustainability  of  economic  growth  in  China,  we  expect  the  Macau  market  to  grow  on  a  long-term  basis  due  to  further  development  andpenetration
 of the mainland China market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Macau. We believe recenttrends reflect
 stabilization and growth within the Macau market as gross gaming revenue has increased year over year in each month beginning in August 2016 andcontinuing through December 2017.
Our results
 of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continueto
 be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. Forinstance,
 we opened MGM Cotai on February 13, 2018. MGM Cotai is an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort located on an 18 acre site on the CotaiStrip in Macau. The Gaming Inspection and Co
ordination Bureau of Macau (“DICJ”) approved 100 gaming tables for the opening of MGM Cotai and 25 additionalgaming
 tables effective for operation on January 1, 2019, for a total of 125 gaming tables in aggregate. In addition, the DICJ approved the initial transfer of 77gaming tables from MGM Macau 
to MGM Cotai.Additionally, we
 were awarded a casino license to build and operate MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM Springfield is being developedon
 approximately 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield. MGM’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 2,550 slots and 120 tablegames
 including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,500 spaceparking
 garage;  with  an  expected  development  and  construction  cost  of  approximately  $960  million,  excluding  capitalized  interest  and  land-related  costs.Construction of MGM Springfield is expe
cted to be completed in the third quarter of 2018.In
 August  2015,  we  announced  the  implementation  of  a  Profit  Growth  Plan  for  sustained  growth  and  margin  enhancement.  The  Profit  Growth  Plan’sinitiatives
 focused on improving business processes to leverage our scale for greater efficiency and lower costs, and to identify areas of opportunity to organicallydrive incremental revenue
 growth. The Profit Growth Plan included a large number of initiatives to optimize operations and in 2017 we transitioned from the ProfitGrowth Plan to a continuous improvemen
t approach to explore additional opportunities to drive further improvement.Formation
and
Initial
Public
Offering
o
f
MGP 
On April 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidat
ed subsidiary, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”). MGP is organized as anumbrella
 partnership  REIT  (commonly  referred  to  as  an  “UPREIT”)  structure  in  which  substantially  all  of  its  assets  are  owned  by,  and  substantially  all  of  itsbusinesses are conducted through 
the Operating Partnership. MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”):Class A shares and a single Class B share.
32

 We
 own MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to  receive distributions from operations of MGP orupon liquidation
 or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while we, as the owner of the Class B share, are entitled toan
 amount of votes representing a majority of  the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP’s) aggregatebeneficial ownership of th
e combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. The sole general part ner of the Operating Partnership is also a subsidia
ry of MGP. 
In
 connection  with  the  formation  of  MGP,  MGP  used  the  proceeds  from  the  IPO  to  purchase  operating  partnership  units  in  the  Operating  Partnership.Concurrently,
 we contributed the real estate assets associated with The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park,Gold
 Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage to the Operating Partnership in exchange for operating partnership units. A wholly owned subsidiary ofthe
 Operating Partnership (the “landlord”) subsequently leased the properties to a subsidiary of ours (the “tenant”) pursuant to a long-term triple-net master leaseagreement (the “master lease”).  
 
In
 August  2016,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming  Corporation’s  (“Boyd  Gaming”)  ownership  interest  in  Borgata,  at  which  time  Borgatabecame
 a consolidated subsidiary of ours. Subsequently, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from us, and in October 2017, MGP also acquired the long-termleasehold interest and real property associated with MGM Natio
nal Harbor from us. Amendments to the master lease agreement provided that we then lease the realestate
 assets of Borgata and MGM National Harbor from a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 73.4% of the OperatingPartnership units, and MGP held the re
maining 26.6% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. 
See Note 1 in the accompanying conso
lidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and its subsidiaries, which we consolidate in our financialstatements,
 and from which we lease certain of our real estate assets pursuant to a master lease agreement. All intercompany transactions, including transactionsunder the master leas
e, have been eliminated in consolidation.Reportable
Segments
We
 have  two  reportable  segments:  domestic  resorts  and  MGM  China.  We  currently  own  and  operate  14  resorts  in  the  United  States.  MGM  China’soperations
 consist  of  MGM  Macau  resort  and  MGM  Cotai  on  the  Cotai  Strip  in  Macau.  We  have  additional  business  activities  including  investments  inunconsolidated
 affiliates,  and  certain  other  corporate  and  management  operations.  CityCenter  is  our  most  significant  unconsolidated  affiliate,  which  we  alsomanage for
 a fee. Our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations ofsegment results to consolid
ated results.Domestic
resorts.
At December 31, 2017, our domestic r esorts consisted of the following casino resorts: 
Las Vegas, Nevada:
  
Bellagio,  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  (including  The  Signature),  Mandalay  Bay  (including  Delano  and  FourSeasons),
 The  Mirage,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York  (including  the  Park),  Excalibur,  Monte  Carlo  and  CircusCircus Las Vegas.
Other:
  
MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan;  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,  Mississippi;  Gold  Strike  Tunica  in  Tunica,Mississippi;
 Borgata  in  Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey;  and  MGM  National  Harbor  in  Prince  George’s  County,Maryland.
Over
 half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and othernon-gaming
 amenities.  We  market  to different  customer  groups  and utilize  our significant  convention  and meeting  facilities  to maximize  hotel  occupancy  andcustomer
 volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customersat our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenitie
s. Also, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from ourdomestic
 resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded Las Vegas resorts, and from theexpansion of gaming in the United St
ates generally.Key performance indica
tors related to gaming and hotel revenue at our domestic resorts are: 
• Gaming  revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.Our
 normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 20% to 23% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of8.5% to 9% of slots handle; and
33

  
• Hotel  revenue indicators:  hotel  occupancy  (a  volume  indicator);  average  daily  rate  (“ADR,”  a  price  indicator);  and  revenue  per  available  room(“REVPAR,”
 a  summary  measure  of  hotel  results,  combining  ADR  and  occupancy  rate).  Our  calculation  of  ADR,  which  is  the  average  p rice  ofoccupied
 rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or“cash”
 rates  for  each  customer  segment  and  each  type  of  room  product  to  estimate  complimentary  rates  which are  consistent  with  retail  rates.Complimentary
 rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. Because the mix ofrooms
 provided  on  a  complimentary  basis,  particularly  to  casino  customer s,  includes  a  disproportionate  suite  component,  the  composite  ADRincluding complimenta
ry rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.MGM

China.
We  own an approximate 56% controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns andoperates
 MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our investment in MGM China plays an importantrole in extending our rea
ch internationally and will foster future growth and profitability.Revenues
 at MGM Macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the Macau gaming market: VIP casino gaming operations, main floorgaming operations, and slot m
achine operations. VIP players play mostly in dedicated VIP rooms or designated gaming areas. VIP customers can be further dividedinto
 customers sourced by in-house VIP programs and those sourced through gaming promoters. A significant portion of our VIP volume is generated through theuse
 of gaming promoters. Gaming promoters introduce VIP gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gamingcredit
 to  these  players.  In  exchange  for  their  services,  gaming  promoters  are  compensated  through  payment  of  revenue-sharing  arrangements  or  rolling  chipturnover
 based commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. MGM Macau main flooroperations
 primarily consist of walk-in and day trip visitors. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions.The
 profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming  revenues from the mainfloor
 segment have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potentialfor sustainable growth in the 
future.VIP gaming at MGM
 Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chipsfrom
 MGM Macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow MGM Macau to track the amount of wagering conducted byeach gaming promoters’
 clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or apercentage
 of  the  table  games  turnover  they  generate . They  also  receive  a  complimentary  allowance  based  on  a  percentage  of  the  table  games  turnover  theygenerate,
 which  can  be  applied  to  hotel  rooms,  food  and  beverage  and  other  discretionary  customers-related  expenses.  The  estimated  portion  of  the  gamingpromoter
 payments that represent amounts passed through to VIP customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by thegaming
 promoter  for  its  compensation  is  recorded  as  casino  expense.  In-house  VIP  commissions  are  based  on  a  percentage  of  rolling  chip  turnover  and  arerecorded as a reduction o
f casino revenue.In addition to the key performance indicators used by our domestic resorts, MGM Maca
u utilizes “turnover,” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagerswon
 by MGM Macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. Turnover provides abasis for measuring VIP casino win pe
rcentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM Macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% of turnover. Win for mainfloor gaming operations a
t MGM Macau is typically in the range of 16-22% of table games drop.Corporate

and
other.
Corporate  and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations. See  Note 1and Note 7 to the accompanying conso
lidated financial statements for discussion of the Company’s unconsolidated affiliates.

Summary
Operating
Results
 
Consolidated
 net revenues for 2017 increased 14% compared to 2016 due primarily to  the full year of operations at Borgata and MGM National Harbor, anincrease
 in casino revenue, rooms revenue, valet and parking fee revenue at our domestic resorts and an increase in casino revenue at MGM China . Consolidatednet
 revenues  for  2016  increased  3%  compared  to  2015  due  primarily  to the  Borgata  transaction  on  August  1,  2016,  the  opening  of  MGM  National  Harbor  inDecember
 2016 and an increase in casino revenue, rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and other revenue including parking fee revenue at our domesticresorts, partially
 offset by a decrease in casino revenue at MGM China . See  “Operating Results – Detailed Segment Information” below for additional informationrelated to segment revenues.
 
Consolidated
 operating income was $1.7 billion in 2017 compared to $2.1 billion in 2016. The current year period included a full year of operations atBorgata,
 which included a benefit of $36 million related to Borgata’s share of a property tax settlement from Atlantic City, a full year of operations at MGMNational
 Harbor, and a benefit of $45 million related to the modification of the NV Energy exit fee, which included the benefit recognized at our domestic resortsas
 well as our 50% share of the benefit recognized at CityCenter. The prior year included a $430 million gain recognized on the Borgata acquisition and a $401million
 gain  related  to  the  sale  of  The  Shops  at  Crystals  (“Crystals”)  at  CityCenter,  which  was  offset  by  charges  of  $152  million  of  NV  Energy  exit  expenseassociated
 with the Company’s strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy. Operating income at our domestic resorts increased 35%, or$481
 million in 2017 compared to 2016, and benefitted from a full year of contributions from Borgata and MGM National Harbor and a decrease in preopeningexpense. See “Operating
 Results – Details of Certain Charges” below for additional detail on our preopening expense. Corporate expense increased to $357 millionin
 2017 from $313 million in 2016, primarily from a $16 million charge for the Operating Partnership’s share of real estate transfer taxes recorded in connectionwith
 the  MGM  National  Harbor  transaction,  with  the  remainder  of  the  increase  primarily  related  to  corporate  brand  campaign  expenses,  legal  expenses,  andcharitable
 contributions. Operating income at MGM China decreased 24%, or $62 million, compared to 2016 due primarily to an increase in preopening expenserelated
 to the MGM Cotai project. Income from unconsolidated affiliates was $146 million in 2017 compared to $528 million in 2016, which included the gainrelated to the sale o
f Crystals. See “Operating Results – Income from Unconsolidated Affiliates” for additional detail. 
Consolidated
 operating income was $2.1 billion in 2016 compared to an operating loss of $156 million in 2015. Operating income in 2016 was affected bythe
 items discussed above. Operating loss in 2015 was negatively affected by a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to goodwill recognized in the acquisitionof
 a controlling interest in MGM China in 2011. The impairment charge resulted from our annual review of our goodwill carrying values and was incurred as aresult
 of reduced cash flow forecasts for MGM China’s resorts based on market conditions at that time and lower valuation multiples for gaming assets in theMacau market. Income 
from unconsolidated affiliates was $528 million in 2016, as discussed above, compared to $258 million in 2015, which included $80 millionrelated
 to our share of the gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements. Corporate expenseincreased
 to $313 million in 2016 from $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives related to the Profit Growth Plan of $23million,
 costs associated with the initial public offering of MGP of $25 million, transaction costs incurred in connection with the Borgata transaction, incrementalperformance-based co
mpensation expense, and costs associated with a litigation settlement.

Net
 revenue for MGM China increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in main floor table games revenue of 5%, whichwas partially offset by a 3%
 decrease in VIP table games revenue. VIP table games volume increased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 while VIP hold percentagewas 3.2%
 for both the current and prior year periods. Main floor table games volume decreased 1% and hold percentage increased to 20.2% in 2017 from 18.8% in2016. Slots revenue increased 11%

as a result of a 7% increase in general and administrative expense . 38

 to 3.2% in 2016 from 3.3% in 2015. Slots revenue decreased 23% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an 18% decrease in slots volume. Casinorevenue
 was negatively affected in 2016 by the changes in economic factors and policy initiatives in China that began to take place in 2014, and  VIP table gamesrevenue was further impacted by the new regulatory compliance requirements impleme
nted in late 2015 and in 2016 for gaming promoters and operators, as well asthe curtailing of “proxy
” bets as a result of the ban on mobile phone usage at gaming tables, which began in 2016 .

 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4% compared to 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased274 basis points to 27.1% in 2016 primar
ily as a result of an increase in main f loor table games mix and cost reduction efforts .  
Corporate

and
other.
Corporate  and other revenue includes revenues from other corporate operations, management services and reimbursed costs revenueprimarily
 related to our CityCenter management agreement. Reimbursed costs revenue represents reimbursement of costs, primarily payroll-related, incurred by usin connection with the provision o
f management services and was $402 million, $397 million and $399 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Adjusted EBITDA related to corporat
e and other in 2017 decreased compared to the prior year due to our share of the gain recognized in 2016 from the saleof
 Crystals at CityCenter, the gain on the acquisition of Borgata in 2016 and an increase in stock-based compensation, partially offset by the cessation of equitymethod
 accounting for Borgata subsequent to the acquisition and an increase  in corporate expense as described in “Summary Operating Results.” See “OperatingResults – Income from Unconsolida

Preopening and
 start-up expenses decreased in 2017 due primarily to a decrease in preopening and start-up expenses at MGM National Harbor (as it openedin December 2016), partially offset by an
 increase in preopening and start-up expenses at MGM China related to MGM Cotai (which opened in February 2018) andat
 Monte Carlo as part of the property’s on-going rebrand to Park MGM and NoMad Hotel. Preopening and start-up expenses at MGM China include $7 million ofamortization
 of the Cotai land concession premium in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Preopening and start-up expenses at MGMNational
 Harbor include $15 million and $19 million of rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which relates to the groundlease
 for the land on which MGM National Harbor was developed. As the property was open for the entirety of 2017, no rent expense relating to the ground leasewas recorded in preopening and st

We
 completed our acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, at which time the subsidiary operating Borgata became a consolidated subsidiary. Prior to theacquisition, we held a 50% int
erest in Borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. 
In 2017, our share of CityCenter’s ope
rating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $133 million, which included a benefit of $4 millionrelated
 to our share of the modification of the NV Energy exit fee. At Aria, casino revenues increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to a 2% increase in tablegames
 drop and an increase in hold percentage to 25.3% in 2017 compared to 24.6% in 2016 as well as a 6% increase in slots revenue. REVPAR increased by 5%and

e in part to an increase in catering and banquets during the year. 
In 2016,
 our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $445 million, which included $13 million related toour share of NV Energy exit
 expense representing CityCenter’s share of a charge associated with our strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of NVEnergy,
 $41 million related to our share of accelerated depreciation related to the April 2016 closure of the Zarkana theatre, as well as $401 million related to ourshare of a gain recognized by CityCenter on the sale of Crystals an
d the reversal of certain basis differences, compared to $159 million in 2015, which included $80million related to our share of a gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the final resolution of its constructi
on litigation and related settlements. At Aria, casinorevenues
 decreased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a 7% decrease in table games volume partially offset by an increase in hold percentage to 24.6% in 2016compared to
 23.8% in 2015. The decrease in table games revenue was partially offset by a 2% increase in slots revenue. REVPAR increased by 4% and 8% at Ariaand Vdara, respectively, which

In
 2017, interest cost related to MGM Resorts, excluding MGM China, decreased compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average debtoutstanding
 related to our senior notes and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of our senior notes. This was partially offset by an increase in theaverage
 debt outstanding under our credit facilities and an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest cost related to MGM China increased in 2017compared
 to 2016 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the MGM China credit facility and an increase in the weighted averageinterest
 rate. In 2016, interest cost related to MGM Resorts, excluding MGM China, decreased compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in the averagelong-term
 debt outstanding, and also due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate, partially offset by an increase in amortization of debt issuance costassociated with the MGP relat
ed financing transactions in April 2016. Interest cost related to MGM China increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase inthe average outstanding a
mounts borrowed under the MGM China credit facility partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs. 
Capitalized
 interest in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to the opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016, partially offset due to theMGM Cotai and MGM Springfield project
s. Capitalized interest in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due primarily to the MGM Cotai, MGM National Harbor, andMGM Springfield projects.
 
Non-operating

items
from
unconsolidated
affiliates.
 Non-operating  expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $18 million in 2017 compared to2016,
 and decreased $23 million in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, at which time the subsidiary operatingBorgata
 became a consolidated subsidiary of our company. Prior to the acquisition, we held a 50% ownership interest in Borgata, which was accounted for underthe equity method.
 
Other,
net.
Other expense in  2017 primarily consisted of a $30 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to our 11.375% senior notes due2018,
 as well as a $14 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to the MGM National Harbor credit facility. Other expense in 2016 primarilyconsisted
 of a $16 million loss on the early retirement of debt related to our 7.625% senior notes due 2017, as well as a $49 million loss incurred on the earlyretirement
 of debt related to our previously outstanding 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and 10% senior notes due 2016 and our prior senior credit facility, recorded inthe
 second quarter of 2016. The previously discussed losses related to the early retirement of debt recorded in 2016 are primarily responsible for the increase inother non-operating expense 
from 2016 to 2015.

Our
 effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.4 billion resulting from the remeasurement ofdeferred
 tax assets and liabilities  required as a result of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Our effective  tax rate in 2016 wasfavorably
 impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portionof the gain on the Borgata tr
ansaction, partially offset41

 by
 income  tax  expense  attributable  to  the  remeasurement  of  Macau  deferred  tax  liabilities  resulting  from  a  change  in  assumption  concerning  renewal  of  theexemption
 from the Macau complementary tax on gaming profits. Our effective ta x  rate in 2015 was unfavorably impacted by the non-cash impairment charge onMGM China goodwill for which we did not record in
come tax benefit, partially offset by an income tax benefit for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance. 
Cash
 taxes paid increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased U.S. taxable incomeand
 state income taxes attributable to Borgata, which has been consolidated since the August 2016 acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in the company. Cashtaxes paid increased in 2016 
compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased U.S. taxable income. 
Non-GAAP
Measures
 
“Adjusted
 EBITDA” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-upexpenses,
 NV Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” isAdjusted
 EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the MGM Resorts and MGP stock compensation plans, which are notallocated to each property. MGM China recognizes stock compensati
on expense related to its stock-based compensation plan which is included in the calculation ofAdjusted
 EBITDA  for  MGM  China.  “Same-store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA”  is  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  related  to  the  operating  resorts  which  wereconsolidated
 by  the  Company  for  both  the  entire  current  and  prior  year  periods  presented.  “Adjusted  EBITDA  margin”  is  Adjusted  EBITDA  divided  by  netrevenues.
 “Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA margin” is Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA divided by “same-store” net revenues. Adjusted EBITDAinformation
 is  presented  solely  as  a  supplemental  disclosure  to  reported  GAAP  measures  because  management  believes  these  measures  are  1)  widely  usedmeasures
 of operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies. We present Adjusted Property EBITDA ona
 “same-store”  basis  as  supplemental  information  because  management  believes  that  providing  performance  measures  on  a  “same-store”  basis  is  useful  forevaluating the period-to-peri
od performance of our domestic casino resorts. 
We
 believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAmargin, and
 Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA margin may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, itis
 useful  to  exclude  such  items  when  analyzing  current  results  and  trends  compared  to  other  periods  because  these  items  can  vary  significantly  depending  onspecific
 underlying  transactions  or  events  that  may  not  be  comparable  between  the  periods  being  presented.  Also,  we  believe  excluded  items  may  not  relatespecifically
 to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periodswhen
 we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as thesize
 and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets withinour resorts, but also includes g
ains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investmentsin
 unconsolidated  affiliates,  which  may  not  be  comparable  period  over  period.  In  addition,  capital  allocation,  tax  planning,  financing  and  stock  compensationawards
 are all managed at the corporate level. Therefore, we use Adjusted Property EBITDA and Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary measureof domestic resorts oper
ating performance. 
Adjusted
 EBITDA,  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA,  Same-store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA,  Adjusted  EBITDA  margin  or  Same-store  Adjusted  PropertyEBITDA
 margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net income, as indicators of our performance; or as alternatives to cash flows fromoperating
 activities, as measures of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have significantuses
 of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, AdjustedProperty
 EBITDA, Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, or Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA margin. Also, other companiesin
 the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAmargin
 or  Same-store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  margin  information  may  calculate  Adjusted  EBITDA,  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA,  Same-store  AdjustedProperty EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin or Same-store Adjus
ted Property EBITDA margin in a different manner.42

Summary
 
We
 require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize company-wide cashmanagement
 procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily intocentral
 bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. In addition, from time totime
 we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt securities subject to limitations in our senior secured credit facility. At December 31, 2017 and2016, we
 held cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents related to MGM China at December 31, 2017 and2016
 was $676 million and $454 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents related to the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $260million and $360 million, r
espectively.

activities.
Trends  in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected bychanges in
 working capital, cash paid for interest, the timing of significant tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash providedby
 operating  activities  was  $2.2  billion  in  2017  compared  to  $1.5  billion  in  2016.  Operating  cash  flows  increased  in  the  current  period  due  to  an  increase  inoperating income at our domestic resorts, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes. Cas
h provided by operating activities in 2017 was positively affectedby changes in working capital pr
imarily related to the timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at MGM China.45

  
Cash
 provided by operating activities in 2016 increased from 2015 due to an increase in operating income at our domestic resorts and a decrease in cashpaid
 for interest, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes. Cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was negatively affected by changes in workingcapital primarily related to short-term
 gaming liabilities.

 Other
Factors
Affecting
Liquidity  
Anticipated

uses
of
cash.
 We  have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. At December 31,2017,
 we had $13.0 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $373 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion senior secured creditfacility,
 $2.1 billion outstanding under the $2.7 billion Operating Partnership credit facility, and $2.3 billion outstanding under the $2.9 billion MGM China creditfacility.
 In the next twelve months, we have due an estimated $710 million of cash interest payments and $820 million of term loan principal payments, of whichapproximately
 $774 million relates to MGM China’s existing credit facility. MGM China is in the process of amending its credit facility to extend the maturitydate,
 extend the timing of and reduce the amount of scheduled amortization payments, and increase the maximum leverage ratio. We believe we have the ability tomeet
 known obligations, including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures, over the next twelve months from the balance sheetdate with existing cash and c
ash deposits, cash flows from operations, and availability under our revolving credit facilities. 
In
 addition, we have made significant investments through December 31, 2017 and we expect to make capital investments as described below during 2018.See “Executive Overview” for 
further information regarding the scope and timing of our significant development projects. 
 
• Approximately $640 million in capital expenditures at our domestic resorts and corporate entities, excluding MGM Springfield; 
• Approximately $455 million on th e MGM Cotai project, excluding development fees and capitalized interest; 
• Approximately $375 million on th e MGM Springfield project, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs; and 
• Approximately $115 million in maintenance capital improvements at MGM China. 
Our
 capital  expenditures  fluctuate  depending  on  our  decisions  with  respect  to  strategic  capital  investments  in  new  or  existing  resorts  and  the  timing  ofcapital investments 
to maintain the quality of our resorts, the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spacesand
 hotel rooms. Future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure ofour ownership interests in futu
re developments.

See Note 10 to the accompanying conso

Off
Balance
Sheet
Arrangements
 
Our
 off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in CityCenter,Grand
 Victoria,  and  Las  Vegas  Arena  Company,  LLC.  We  have  not  entered  into  any  transactions  with  special  purpose  entities,  nor  have  we  engaged  in  anyderivative
 transactions, other than the Operating Partnership’s cash flow hedges. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additionalinformation. Our unconsolidat
ed affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment facilities in amanner
 that minimizes our initial investment. We guarantee the T-Mobile Arena credit facility as described in Item 2 – Properties. In addition, there are no otherprovisions in
 the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership ofthe resort.

Our  purchase obligations represent minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors, primarily utility and entertainment contracts. Also, although openpurchase
 orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needsprior to the delivery of goods or performance of services, and hence, have not been included in the table above.
 
Critical
Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates
 
Management’s discussion and
 analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Toprepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles ge
nerally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimatesand
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly inareas
 we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations,financial
 position or cash flows. Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about ourcritical
 accounting estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degreeof uncertainty and therefore
 actual results can differ from our estimates.49

Marker
 play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker playto
 the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers andgaming
 promoters. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their markerbalances
 timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailingof
 statements  and  delinquency  notices,  personal  contacts,  the  use  of  outside  collection  agencies  and  civil  litigation.  Markers  are  generally  legally  enforceableinstruments
 in the United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreigncustomers
 may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, whenwe issue credit to custome
rs at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates the creditworthiness
 of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 60% and 49%, respectively, of ourgross casino accounts rece
ivable were owed by customers from the United States. 
We
 maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operatingexpense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowa
nce for doubtful casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play isnot
 significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. At domestic resorts where marker play issignificant,
 we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically  analyze the collectability  of eachaccount with a balance ove
r the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other knowninformation.
 MGM  China  specifically  analyzes  the  collectability  of  casino  receivables  on  an  individual  basis  taking  into  account  the  age  of  the  account,  thefinancial condition and 
the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer. 
In
 addition  to  enforceability  issues,  the  collectability  of  unpaid  markers  given  by  foreign  customers  at  our  domestic  resorts  is  affected  by  a  number  offactors,
 including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balancescan
 be  significant,  the  allowance  and  the  provision  can  change  significantly  between  periods,  as  information  about  a  certain  customer  becomes  known  or  aschanges in a region’s economy o
ccur. 
The following table shows key statis
tics related to our casino receivables, net of discounts:

 in the current year due to a decrease in the age of outstanding account balances. At December 31, 2017, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance fordoubtful accounts as a perc

Fixed
Asset
Capitalization
and
Deprec
iation
Policies 
Property
 and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  A  significant  amount  of  our  property  and  equipment  was  acquired  through  business  combinations  and  wastherefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolon
g itslife
 are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When weconstruct
 assets,  we  capitalize  direct  costs  of  the  project,  including  fees  paid  to  architects  and  contractors,  property  taxes,  and  certain  costs  of  our  design  andconstruction
 subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project.Interest
 is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest startswhen construction activit
ies begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period. 
50

 We
 must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or acapital asset is a
 matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, w e must determine  whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired,which
 also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated usefullives.
 We  det ermine  the  estimated  useful  lives  based  on  our  experience  with  similar  assets,  engineering  studies,  and  our  estimate  of  the  usage  of  the  asset.Whenever events or cir
cumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the ch ange prospectively.  
Impairment
of
Long-lived
Assets,
Goodwill
and
Inde
finite-lived
Intangible
Assets 
We
 evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used.Several
 criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell theasset
 at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower ofcarrying value or
 fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assetsto
 be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on anundiscounted
 basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscountedcash
 flows  do  not  exceed  the  carrying  value,  then  an  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset.  For  operating  assets,  fair  value  is  typicallymeasured
 using a discounted  cash flow model  whereby future  cash flows are  discounted  using a weighted-average  cost of capital,  developed  using a standardcapital
 asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining constructioncosts. All recognized impa
irment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. 
There
 are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of theasset. To
 the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest levelfor
 which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cashflow estimates are, by t
heir nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 
On a
 quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment.Potential
 factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economicfactors,
 significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgetsand
 probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potentialsale. Historically, undiscoun
ted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. 
We review indefinite-lived inta
ngible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment testfor
 indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks.For
 our  2017  annual  impairment  test,  we  utilized  the  option  to  perform  a  qualitative  (“step  zero”)  analysis  for  certain  of  our  indefinite-lived  intangibles  andconcluded
 it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. We elected to perform aquantitative
 analysis for the Borgata trade name using a discounted cash flow approach, for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 4%.For our
 2016 and 2015 annual impairment tests we utilized the two-step quantitative analysis for all of our intangible assets, using a discounted cash flow approachfor license
 rights and using the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks. The estimated fair values of the intangibles were substantially in excess of their carryingvalues,
 with the fair value of the Borgata trade name exceeding its carrying value by approximately 2%, reflecting the recentness of the Borgata Transaction. Asdiscussed
 below,  management  makes  significant  judgments  and  estimates  as  part  of  these  analyses.  If  certain  future  operating  results  do  not  meet  currentexpectations it could cau
se carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. 
We
 review  goodwill  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certain  circumstances.  With  the  exception  of  our  MGM  China  reporting  unit,discussed
 below, none of our other reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2017, 2016 or 2015. For our 2017 annual goodwill impairmenttests,
 we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for all of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fairvalues
 of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values. We utilized the quantitative analysis for the MGM China reporting unit, for which the fair value ofsuch reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by
 a substantial margin. For our 2016 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysisfor
 certain of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carryingvalues
 by a substantial margin. The estimated fair values of reporting units for which we elected to forego the step zero analysis and instead utilized the two-stepquantitative
 analysis were substantially in excess of their carrying values. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part ofthese analyses. If future operating results of
 our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed theirfair values in future p
eriods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.51

  
During
 the fourth quarter of 2015 we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units, including our MGMChina reporting unit. The
 step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. The decreasein
 fair value resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples ofthe
 MGM China reporting unit as well as those of the MGM China reporting unit’s peer group. As a result of the indication of impairment from the step oneanalysis, we proceeded
 to perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. As such, we determined the fair  values of all assets of the MGMChina
 reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded theirrespective
 carrying values by a significant amount, leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill.  Therefore,  we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairmentcharge to reduce the his
torical carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit to its implied fair value in 2015. 
There
 are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective andactual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment
tests are highly judgment
al and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.

ing consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

Income
Taxes
 
We recognize deferred tax asset
s, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences witha future tax benefit 
to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. 
We
 file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid inforeign jurisdictions a
re not material. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. Positionstaken
 in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See Note 11 in theaccompanying consolidated 
financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities. 
We
 assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold, and is measured at thelargest
 amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. Liabilitieswe
 record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in “Other accruedliabilities” or
 long-term in “Other long-term liabilities” based on the time until expected payment. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any,related to unrecogniz
ed tax benefits in income tax expense. 
Refer to Note 11 in the accomp
anying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes. 
Market
Risk
 
In
 addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arisingfrom adverse changes in market rates
 and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate riskassociated
 with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowingsand
 short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the OperatingPartnership’s
 term  loan  B  facility.  A  change  in  interest  rates  generally  does  not  have  an  impact  upon  our  future  earnings  and  cash  flow  for  fixed-rate  debtinstruments.
 As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected bychanges
 in  interest  rates.  This  effect  would  be  realized  in  the  periods  subsequent  to  the  periods  when  the  debt  matures.  We  do  not  hold  or  issue  financialinstruments for trading pu
rposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.52

 As
 of December 31, 2017, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 27% of our total borrowings after giving effect to the $500 million and $700million
 notional amount Operating Partnership interest rate swaps with w eighted  average fixed rates that we pay 1.764% and 1.901%, respectively. The followingtable
 provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the Operating Partnership interestrate

In
 addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates,mainly
 related to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Macau and the development of MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have notbeen
 significant,  potential  changes  in  policy  by  governments  or  fluctuations  in  the  economies  of  the  United  States,  China,  Macau  or  Hong  Kong  could  causevariability
 in these exchange rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for theHong
 Kong dollar will remain at the same level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange ratethereof.
 As of December 31, 2017, a 1% increase in the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar exchange rate would impactthe carrying value of our 
cash balance by $7 million and a 1% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $23 million.

 Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal
 control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  Ourresponsibility

ties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whether ef
fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding ofinternal
 control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internalcontrol
 based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides areasonable basis for our opin

Definition
and
Limitations
of
Internal
Control
over
Financia
l
Reporting 
A
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand
 the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.

Organization.
MGM  Resorts International (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise,the
 “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates casino resorts. As discussed furtherbelow,
 the  Company  leases  certain  of  its  real  estate  assets  from  MGM  Growth  Properties  Operating  Partnership  LP  (the  “Operating  Partnership”),  which  is  aconsolidated subsidiary.
 
The
 Company owns and operates the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas,The
 Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur and Circus Circus Las Vegas. Operations at MGM Grand Las Vegas includemanagement
 of The Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas, a condominium-hotel consisting of three towers. The Company operates and, along with local investors,owns
 MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan and MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland. The Company also owns and operates Borgatalocated
 on Renaissance Pointe in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New Jersey and the following resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike inTunica.
 Additionally,  the  Company  owns  and  operates  the  Park,  a  dining  and  entertainment  district  located  between  New  York-New  York  and  Monte  Carlo,Shadow
 Creek,  an  exclusive  world-class  golf  course  located  approximately  ten  miles  north  of  its  Las  Vegas  Strip  resorts,  Primm  Valley  Golf  Club  at  theCalifornia/Nevada stat
e line and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi. 
On
 April 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of57,500,000
 of  its Class  A shares  representing  limited  liability  company  interests  (inclusive  of the  full  exercise  by the  underwriters  of  their  option  to purchase7,500,000
 Class A shares) at an initial offering price of $21 per share. In connection with the IPO, the Company and MGP entered into a series of transactions andseveral agreements 
that, among other things, set forth the terms and conditions of the IPO and provide a framework for the Company’s relationship with MGP. 
MGP
 is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned byand
 substantially  all  of  its  businesses  are  conducted  through  its  Operating  Partnership  subsidiary.  MGP  has  two  classes  of  authorized  and  outstanding  votingcommon shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares an
d a single Class B share. The Company owns MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holderany
 rights  to  profits  or  losses  or  any  rights  to  receive  distributions  from  operations  of  MGP  or  upon  liquidation  or  winding  up  of  MGP.  MGP’s  Class  Ashareholders
 are entitled to one vote per share, while the Company, as the owner of the Class B share, is entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority ofthe
 total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the Company and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combinedeconomic
 interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. The Company and MGP each hold Operating Partnership units representinglimited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. The general partner of the O
perating Partnership is also a subsidiary of MGP, which is 100% owned by MGP.The
 Operating Partnership units held by the Company are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, or cash at the fair value of a Class Ashare. The determination of settlement method is at the option of MGP’s independent conflicts committee. The Com
pany and MGP’s ownership interest percentagein
 the Operating Partnership have varied based upon the transactions that MGP has completed, as discussed in Note 13. As of December 31, 2017, the Companyowned 73.4% of the Operating Partnersh
ip units, and MGP held the remaining 26.6% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.   
Pursuant to a master contribution agreement entered into in connection with the IPO b
y and between the Company, MGP, and the Operating Partnership, theCompany
 contributed the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica,MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage to newly formed subsi
diaries and subsequently transferred 100% ownership in such subsidiaries to the Operating Partnershipin
 exchange for a percentage ownership of Operating Partnership units. Concurrently, pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company(the “tenant”) and a subs
idiary of the Operating Partnership (the “landlord”), the tenant leased the contributed real estate assets from the landlord. 
Subsequent
 to the Company completing its acquisition of Borgata in August 2016, as discussed in Note 4, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from asubsidiary
 of the Company, and in October 2017, MGP also acquired the long-term leasehold interest and real property associated with MGM National Harborfrom
 a subsidiary of the Company. Amendments to the master lease agreement provides for the Company to lease the real estate assets of Borgata and MGMNational
 Harbor from a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. See Note 10, Note 13, and Note 18 for additional information related to MGP, its ownership andtransactions, and cert
ain other intercompany agreements and debt financing transactions entered into in connection therewith.

NOTE

—
BASIS
OF

PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIESPrinciples

of
consolidation.
For  entities  not  determined  to  be  a  variable  interest  entity  (“VIE”),  the  Company  consolidates  such  entities  in  which  theCompany owns 100% of
 the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity if it has thedirect
 or indirect ability to control the entities’ activities based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements. For these entities, the Companyrecords
 a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50% or less owned areaccounted
 for  under  the  equity  method  when  the  Company  can  exercise  significant  influence  over  or  has  joint  control  of  the  unconsolidated  affiliate.  Allintercompany balances 
and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The
 Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.A VIE is an entity in which either (i) the
 equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity thatmost significantly impact
 such entity’s economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additionalsubordinated
 financial support. The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) thepower to direct the act
ivities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefitsof the VIE
 that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary.For these
 VIEs, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE uponsubsequent
 events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and thedisposition of all or a port
ion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.72

 Management has determ
ined that MGP is a VIE b ecause the Class A equity investo rs as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct theactivities of such ent
ity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary bene ficiary of MGP and
 consolidates MGP because (i) its ownership of MGP’s single Class B share entitles it to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) theexchangeable nature
 of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the Company t he right  to receive benefits from MGP that could potentially be significant toMGP.
 The Company has recorded MGP’s ownership interest in the Operating Partnership of 26.6% as of December 31, 2017 as noncontrolling interest in theCompany’s consolidated fin 
ancial  statements. As of December 31, 2017, on a consolidated basis MGP had total assets of $10.4 billion, primarily related to its realestate investments, and 
total liabilities of $4.3 billion, primarily related to its indebtedness.   
R
eclassifications.
Certain reclassifications have  been made to conform the prior period presentation.Management’s
use

of
estimates.
The  consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted inthe
 United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assetsand liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
 and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during thereporting period. Actual r
esults could differ from those estimates. 
Fair

value
measurements.
Fair  value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments inunconsolidated
 affiliates, cost method investments, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair valuemeasurements also
 affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sellan
 asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy thatincludes:
 Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which areunobservable inputs. 
The Company used the following inputs in i ts fair value measurements: 
 
• Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 10; 
• Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the Borgata transaction. See Note 4; 
• Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when measuring the impairment of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit. See Note 8; and 
• Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of its investment in Grand Victoria. See Note 7 
Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents  include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date ofacquisition.
 Such  investments  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  market  value.  Book  overdraft  balances  resulting  from  the  Company’s  cash  managementprogram are recorded as acco
unts payable or construction payable as applicable. 
Accounts
receivable
and
credit
risk.
Financial instruments that  potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casinoaccounts
 receivable.  The  Company  issues  credit  to  approved  casino  customers  and  gaming  promoters  following  background  checks  and  investigations  ofcreditworthiness.
 At December 31, 2017, 35% of the Company’s casino receivables at its domestic resorts were due from customers residing in foreign countriesand 8%
 of the Company’s casino receivables related to MGM China. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect thecollectability of su
ch receivables. 
Accounts receivable are typically
 non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to beuncollectible.
 Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce theCompany’s
 receivables  to  their  net  carrying  amount,  which  approximates  fair  value.  The  allowance  is  estimated  based  on  both  a  specific  review  of  customeraccounts
 as  well  as  historical  collection  experience  and  current  economic  and  business  conditions.  Management  believes  that  as  of  December  31,  2017,  nosignificant concentr
ations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded. 
Inventories.
Inventories  consist  primarily  of  food  and  beverage,  retail  merchandise  and  operating  supplies,  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  netrealizable
 value.  Cost  is  determined  primarily  using  the  average  cost  method  for  food  and  beverage  and  operating  supplies.  Cost  for  retail  merchandise  isdetermined using the cost 
method. 
73

 Property
and
equipment.
Property and equipment are s tated at cost. A significant amount of the Compa ny’s property and equipment was a cquired throughbusiness
 combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in thedetermination
 of income or loss. Maintenanc e  costs are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had accrued $28 million and $36million
 for property and equipment within accounts payable and $34 million and $32 million related to construction retention within other long-t erm  liabilities,respectively.
 
Property and equipment are g
enerally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis: 
Buildings and improvements
 20 to 40 years Land improvements
 10 to 20 years Furniture and fixtures
 3 to 20 years Equipment
 3 to 15 years  
The
 Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held andused.
 Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sellthe
 asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower ofcarrying
 value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets tobe
 held and used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows ofthe
 asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If theundiscounted
 cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using adiscounted
 cash  flow  model.  If  an  asset  is  still  under  development,  future  cash  flows  include  remaining  construction  costs.  All  recognized  impairment  losses,whether for assets held for s
ale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. 
Capitalized

interest.
The  interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project.When
 no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of the Company’soutstanding
 borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a briefperiod.
 
Investments

in
and
advances
to
unconsolidated
affiliates.
The  Company  has  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for  under  the  equitymethod.
 Under  the  equity  method,  carrying  value  is  adjusted  for  the  Company’s  share  of  the  investees’  earnings  and  losses,  amortization  of  certain  basisdifferences,
 as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a returnof
 investment and recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income andlosses
 as  well  as  gains  and  impairments  related  to  its  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  as  a  component  of  operating  income  or  loss,  as  the  Company’sinvestments in such unconsolida
ted affiliates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations. 
The
 Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryingvalue
 of its investment may have experienced an “other-than-temporary” decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair valueof
 the investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is “other-than-temporary” based on itsassessment
 of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using adiscounted
 cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approachthat utilizes business en
terprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. See Note 7 and Note 16 for results of the Company’sreview of its investment 
in certain of its unconsolidated affiliates. 
Goodwill

and
other
intangible
assets.
Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  businesscombinations.
 Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  must  be  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certaincircumstances.
 The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments  were indicated or recorded as a resultof
 the annual  impairment  review for goodwill and indefinite-lived  intangible  assets in 2017  and  2016.  An impairment  of  goodwill  related  to  the  MGM Chinareporting unit was recorded 
as a result of the annual impairment review in 2015. See Note 8. 
Accounting
 guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly referredto
 as  “step  zero”)  in  order  to  determine  whether  further  impairment  testing  is  necessary.  In  performing  the  step  zero  analysis  the  Company  considersmacroeconomic
 conditions,  industry  and  market  considerations,  current  and  forecasted  financial  performance,  entity-specific  events,  and  changes  in  thecomposition or carrying a
mount of net assets of reporting units for74

 goodwill. In
 addition, the Company ta kes  into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis thatwas performed, as well as
 the period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero analysis ind icates that it is mo re likely than not thatthe fair value is less 
than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a quantitative analysis. 
Under
 the quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimatedfuture
 results of the Company’s reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a marketapproach
 that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. Effective January 1, 2017, the Companyprospectively
 adopted  accounting  guidance  that  simplifies  goodwill  impairment  testing  by  eliminating  the  requirement  to  calculate  the  implied  fair  value  ofgoodwill
 (formerly “Step 2”) in the event that impairment is identified. Instead, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying valueexceeds
 the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Under the quantitative analysis, license rights aretested
 for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair value of anindefinite-lived intangible as
set is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. 
Revenue

recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
Casino  revenue  is  the  aggregate  net  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses,  with  liabilitiesrecognized
 for funds deposited by customers  before gaming play occurs (“casino  front money”)  and for chips in the customers’  possession (“outstanding  chipliability”).
 Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and goods are provided. Advancedeposits on rooms and advance ti
cket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer. 
Gaming
 revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives, including discounts and points earned in point-loyalty programs. The retail value of hotelrooms,
 food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. Theestimated cost of provid
ing promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Gaming
promoters.
A  significant portion of the high-end (“VIP”) gaming volume at MGM Macau is generated through the use of gaming promoters, alsoknown
 as junket operators. These operators introduce VIP gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gamingcredit
 to these players. VIP gaming at MGM Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase thesenonnegotiable
 chips from MGM Macau and in turn sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow MGM Macau to track the amount of wageringconducted
 by each gaming promoter’s clients in order to determine VIP gaming play volume, or rolling chip turnover, which is the amount of nonnegotiable chipswagered
 and lost. In exchange for the gaming promoters’ services, MGM Macau compensates the gaming promoters through revenue-sharing arrangements androlling
 chip turnover-based commissions. The estimated portion of the gaming promoter commissions that represent amounts passed through to VIP customers isrecorded as a reduction o
f casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense. 
Reimbursed

costs.
The  Company recognizes costs reimbursed pursuant to management services as revenue in the period it incurs the costs. Reimbursedcosts related prima
rily to the Company’s management of CityCenter. 
Loyalty
programs.
The Company’s primary loyalty p rogram is “M life Rewards” and is available to patrons at most of the Company’s domestic resorts andCityCenter.
 Members may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gaming play which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the M life Rewards frontdesk
 at participating properties. Points may also be redeemed for free slot play on participating machines. The Company records a liability based on the pointsearned
 multiplied  by the redemption  value,  less an estimate  for points not expected  to be redeemed,  and records  a corresponding  reduction  in casino revenue.Customers
 also earn Express Comps based on their gaming play which can be redeemed for complimentary goods and services, including hotel rooms, food andbeverage,
 and entertainment. The Company records a liability for the estimated costs of providing goods and services for Express Comps based on the ExpressComps
 earned multiplied by a cost margin, less an estimate for Express Comps not expected to be redeemed and records a corresponding expense in the casinodepartment.
 MGM Macau also has loyalty programs, including M life Rewards as well as the Golden Lion Club, which provides benefits to customers focused ongaming.

 Advertising.
The  Company  expenses  advertising  costs  the  first  time  the  advertising  ta kes  place.  Advertising  expense,  which  is  generally  included  ingeneral and administr
ative expenses, was $223 million, $171   million and $156 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Corporate
expense.
Corporate expense  represents unallocated payroll, aircraft costs, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to theCompany’s
 casino  resort  operations.  In  addition,  corporate  expense  includes  the  costs  associated  with  the  Company’s  evaluation  and  pursuit  of  new  businessopportunities, which are expens
ed as incurred. 
Preopening
and

start-up
expenses.
Preopening  and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as preopeningand start-up expenses includ
e payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations. 
Property

transactions,
net.
The  Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and normal gains and losses onthe sale of assets as “Prope
rty transactions, net.” See Note 16 for a detailed discussion of these amounts. 
Redeemable

noncontrolling 
interest.
In  2015  and  2016,  MGM  National  Harbor  issued  non-voting  economic  interests  in  MGM  National  Harbor(“Interests”)
 to noncontrolling interest parties for a total aggregate purchase price of $53 million. The Interests provide for annual preferred distributions by MGMNational
 Harbor to the noncontrolling interest parties based on a percentage of its annual net gaming revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operatingagreement). Such distribu
tions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90-days after the end of each fiscal year. 
Beginning
 on December 31, 2019 the noncontrolling interest parties will each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portionof
 their Interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula. Additionally, certain noncontrolling interest parties each have the right to sellback all
 or a portion of their Interests prior to such date if MGM National Harbor were to guarantee or grant liens to secure any indebtedness of the Company or itsaffiliates other 
than the indebtedness of MGM National Harbor. 
The
 Company  has  recorded  the  Interests  as  “Redeemable  noncontrolling  interests”  in  the  mezzanine  section  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balancesheets
 and  not  stockholders’  equity  because  their  redemption  is  not  exclusively  in  the  Company’s  control.  Interests  were  initially  accounted  for  at  fair  value.Subsequently, the Company recognizes 
changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests toequal
 the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Companyrecords any
 changes caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests isadjusted
 for  accrued  annual  preferred  distributions,  with  changes  caused  by  such  adjustments  recorded  within  net  income  (loss)  attributable  to  noncontrollinginterests.

Recently

issued
accounting
standards.
In  May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” which outlines anew,
 single  comprehensive  model  for  entities  to  use  in  accounting  for  revenue  arising  from  contracts  with  customers  and  supersedes  most  current  revenuerecognition
 guidance,  including  industry-specific  guidance.  Under  the  standard,  revenue  is  recognized  when  a  customer  obtains  control  of  promised  goods  orservices in an amount tha
t reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services.   
The
 Company adopted ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis, effective January 1, 2018, which will be reflected in future financial statements. The mostsignificant impacts o
f adoption of the new accounting pronouncement are as follows: 
 
• Promotional  Allowances:  The Company  is  no  longer  permitted  to  recognize  revenues  for  goods  and services  provided  to  customers  for free  as  aninducement
 to  gamble  as  gross  revenue  with  a  corresponding  offset  to  promotional  allowances  to  arrive  at  net  revenues,  and  accordingly  thepromotional
 allowances line item will be removed in future filings. The majority of such amounts previously included in promotional allowances willnow
 offset casino revenues based on stand-alone selling price. This change will primarily result in a reclassification of revenue between revenue lineitems;
 
 
• Loyalty Accounting: Accounting for Express Comps granted under the M life Rewards program and points granted under the Golden Lion Club willbe identified as separate
 performance obligations and recorded as a reduction in gaming revenues when earned at the retail value of such benefits owedto
 the  customer  (less  estimated  breakage)  and  an  increase  to  the  loyalty  program  liability  representing  outstanding  performance  obligations.  Suchamounts
 will be recognized as revenue in the line item of the corresponding good or service provided when the performance obligation is fulfilled.This
 change will result in a decrease to beginning retained earnings of approximately $41 million as a result of the initial application of the standardand will not have a signific
ant impact to earnings; 
77

  
• Gaming Promoter  Commission:  Commissions  paid to gaming  promoters  under MGM China’s incentive  program  will no w  be fully  reflected  as areduction in casino revenu
e. This change will primarily result in a decrease in casino expense and a corresponding decrease in casino revenue; 
 
• Gross versus Net Presentation: Mandatory service charges on food and beverage and hotel offerings and wide area progressive operator fees will berecorded
 gross, that is, the amount received from the customer will be recorded as revenue with the corresponding amount paid as an expense. Thesechanges will primarily 
result in an increase in revenue with a corresponding increase in expense; 
 
• Estimated Cost of Promotional Allowances: The Company will no longer reclassify the estimated cost of complimentaries  provided to the gamingpatron
 from other expense line items to the casino expense line item. This change will result in a reclassification of expense between expense lineitems
 which will reduce casino expense by $507 million, $444 million, and $431 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015,respectively,
 and increase Rooms, Food and beverage, Retail, Entertainment and Other expenses. Refer to the ‘Revenue recognition and promotionalallowances’
 section within this note for the historical amounts that will be reclassified back to each expense line item when the retrospective adoptionto prior years is refl
ected in future filings. 
These changes,
 and other less significant adjustments that were required upon adoption, will not have an aggregate material impact on operating income, netincome, or cash flows 
.  
In
 February  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2016-02,  “Leases  (Topic  842),”  (“ASU  2016-02”),  which  replaces  the  existing  guidance  in  AccountingStandards
 Codification (“ASC”) 840, “Leases.” ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15,2018.
 ASU 2016-02  requires  a  dual  approach  for  lessee  accounting  under  which  a  lessee  would  account  for  leases  as  finance  leases  or  operating  leases.  Bothfinance
 leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, thelessee
 would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense.The Company is currently assessing 
the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In
 August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (aconsensus
 of  the  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force),”  (“ASU  2016-15”),  effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2017.  ASU  2016-15  amends  theguidance
 of ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reducethe
 diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles, specifically clarifying the guidance on eight cash flow issues. The adoption of ASU2016-15 did not have a materi
al effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In January 2017, the
 Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718),” (“ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 simplifiesthe
 accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity orliabilities,
 and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 has separate transition guidance for each element of the new standard. The adoption ofASU 2016-09 did not have a material e
ffect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In
 January 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held Through Related Parties that are Under CommonControl,”
 (“ASU 2016-17”). The amendments affect the evaluation of whether to consolidate a VIE in certain situations involving entities under common control.Specifically,
 the amendments change the evaluation of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE for an entity that is a single decision-maker of avariable
 interest by changing how an entity treats indirect interests in the VIE held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity.The
 guidance  in  ASU  2016-17  must  be  applied  retrospectively  to  all  relevant  periods.  The  adoption  of  ASU  2016-17  did  not  have  a  material  effect  on  theCompany’s consolidated financ
ial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In
 January  2017,  the  Company  early  adopted  ASU  No.  2017-04,  “Intangibles  –  Goodwill  and  Other  (Topic  350):  Simplifying  the  Test  for  GoodwillImpairment”
 (“ASU 2017-04”).  ASU 2017-04  simplifies  the  subsequent  measurement  of  goodwill  by  eliminating  step  two  from  the  goodwill  impairment  test.Under
 the  amended  guidance,  the  Company  will  perform  its  annual  goodwill  impairment  tests  (and  interim  tests  if  any  are  determined  to  be  necessary)  bycomparing
 the fair value of its reporting units with their carrying value, and an impairment charge, if any, will be recognized for the amount by which the carryingvalue exceeds
 the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not havea material eff
ect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

BORGATA
TRANSACTI
ON 
On
 August 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Boyd Gaming Corporation’s (“Boyd Gaming”) ownership interest in Borgata. Following thecompletion
 of  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming’s  interest,  MGP  acquired  Borgata’s  real  property  from  the  Company  and  leased  back  the  real  property  to  asubsidiary of the Company.   
 
As
 part of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company agreed to pay Boyd Gaming half of any net amount received or utilized by the Company as itrelates
 to the Atlantic City property tax refund owed to Borgata at the time of the transaction. After taking into account the contingent consideration paid related tothe
 property tax refunds realized by Borgata through the finalization of purchase price accounting, cash paid to Boyd Gaming for its interest in Borgata was $604million.
 As further discussed in Note 12, Borgata subsequently entered into a property tax reimbursement agreement in February 2017 with the Department ofCommunity
 Affairs of the State of New Jersey and Atlantic City and received the settlement amount of $72 million in June 2017, half of which the Company paidBoyd Gaming, net of fees and expenses.  
 
Through
 the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in Borgata, the Company obtained 100% of the equity interests in Borgata and therefore consolidatedBorgata
 as  of  August  1,  2016.  The  Company  recognized  100%  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  Borgata  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of  the  acquisition.  Prior  to  theacquisition,
 the Company held a 50% ownership interest in Borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. The  fair value of the equity interests ofBorgata
 was determined by the transaction price and equaled approximately  $1.2 billion. The carrying value of the Company’s equity method investment wassignificantly less than its
 share of the fair value of Borgata at the acquisition date, resulting in a $430 million gain on the acquisition. Under th e acquisition method,the
 fair  value  was  allocated  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  the  transaction.  The  allocation  of fair  value  for  substantially  all  of  the assets  andliabilities has been 
finalized as of December 31, 2016. 
The following table sets for
th the finalized allocation at December 31, 2016 (in thousands):

As discussed above,
 the Company recognized the identifiable intangible assets of Borgata at fair value. The trade name and customer relationship intangibleassets
 did  not have  historical  cost  bases at  Borgata.  The  estimated  fair  values  of  the intangible  assets  were  determined  using  methodologies  under  the incomeapproach based on significan
t inputs that were not observable.79

  
Unfavorable

lease
liability.
The  Company has assumed the liability of a series of ground leases for a total of approximately 11 acres of land on which theBorgata
 employee parking garage, public space expansion, rooms expansion, modified surface parking lot, beer garden and outdoor pool reside. The Companyrecorded
 an  unfavorable  lease  liability  of  $1  million  in  “Current  liabilities”  and  $47  million  in  “Other  long-term  obligations”  for  the  excess  contractual  leaseobligations over the
 market value of the leases, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease contracts through December 2070. Both amarket and income appro
ach using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs were utilized to determine the fair value of these leases. 
Deferred
taxes.
The  Company recorded an additional net deferred tax liability of $89 million, of which $82 million and $7 million was recorded to incometax
 expense and goodwill, respectively. The net deferred tax liability represents the excess of the financial reporting amounts of the net assets of Borgata over theirrespective basis under U.S. and New Jersey 
tax law expected to be applied to taxable income in the periods such differences are expected to be realized. 
Consolidated

results.
Borgata’s  net revenue for the period from August 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 was $348 million, operating income was $39million and net income was $8 
million.Pro

forma
information.
The  operating  results  for  Borgata  are  included  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations  from  the  date  ofacquisition.

CityCenter
 
Crystals

sale.
In  April 2016, CityCenter closed the sale of Crystals  for approximately $1.1 billion. During  the year ended December 31, 2016, CityCenterrecognized a gain on the sale
 of Crystals of $400 million and the Company recognized a $401 million gain, which included $200 million representing its 50% shareof
 the gain recorded by CityCenter and $201 million representing the reversal of certain basis differences. The basis differences primarily related to other-than-temporary impairm
ent charges recorded on the Company’s investment in CityCenter that were allocated to Crystals’ building assets. 
CityCenter

distributions.
In  April 2017, CityCenter paid a $600 million dividend, consisting of a $350 million dividend using proceeds from the upsizedsenior credit
 facilities and a $250 million dividend from cash on hand, of which $78 million was part of its annual dividend policy. MGM Resorts received its 50%share,
 or $300 million. In  March  2016,  a  $90  million  distribution  was  declared  in  accordance  with  CityCenter’s  annual  distribution  policy  and  in  April  2016,CityCenter
 declared a $990 million special distribution in connection with the Crystals sale. The Company’s $540 million share of such distributions was paid inMay 2016. In April 2015, CityCenter decla
red a special distribution of $400 million, of which the Company received its 50% share of $200 million. 
CityCenter

litigation
settlement.
During  the  first  quarter  of  2015,  CityCenter  recognized  a  $160  million  gain  as  a  result  of  the  final  resolution  of  itsconstruction litigat
ion and related settlements, of which the Company recorded $80 million, its 50% share of the gain. 
CityCenter

credit
facility.
In  April 2017, CityCenter completed a refinancing of its senior credit facility. The new senior credit facility consists of a $1.6billion
 term loan B facility maturing in April 2024 and a $125 million revolving credit facility maturing in April 2022. The term loan B was issued at 99.5% andbears
 interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. The revolving facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%. The term loan B facility requiresCityCenter to make amortizati
on payments of 0.25% of the original principal balance at each quarter end. 
Borgata

As discussed in Note 4, the Company acquired 
Boyd Gaming’s ownership interest in Borgata on August 1, 2016, and therefore began to consolidate Borgatabeginning on that date. Prior th
ereto, the Company’s investment in Borgata was accounted for under the equity method. 
81

 Grand
Victoria
 
At
 December 31, 2015, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its Grand Victoria investment for impairment due to a greater than anticipated declinein operating results resu
lting in part from a continued loss of market share to video gaming terminals, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to theprior
 forecast. The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value from amarket
 participant’s viewpoint. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capitalexpenditures,
 a long-term growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprisevalue
 multiples selected based on the range of multiples in Grand Victoria’s peer group. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that it was necessaryto
 record an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $17 million at December 31, 2015, based on an estimated fair value of $123 million for the Company’s50%
 interest. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis surrounding its long-term growth rate assumption and noted that if a long-term growth rate of 1.5%had
 been used, the resulting estimated fair value of the Company’s 50% interest in Grand Victoria would have been approximately $120 million. The Companyintends
 to, and believes it will be able to, retain its investment in Grand Victoria; however, due to the extent of the shortfall and the Company’s assessment of theuncertainty of fully r
ecovering its investment, the Company has determined that the impairment was other-than-temporary.

On  September 1, 2016, the Company and AEG each sold a 7.5% membership interest in the Las Vegas Arena Company, LLCto Athena Arena, LLC. As a result of

 which became applicable upon the opening of the T-Mobile Arena in April 2016. See Note 12 for discussion of the Company’s repayment guaranteerelated to the Las Vegas Aren

Legacy
sale.
As  discussed in Note 5, the Company closed the sale of its 50% interest in Silver Legacy on November 23, 2015, received proceeds of$58
 million, and recorded a gain of $20 million. The Company’s investment in Silver Legacy was not classified as discontinued operations because the Companyconcluded
 that the sale would not have a major effect on the Company’s operations or its financial results and it did not represent a disposal of a major geographicsegment or product line.
 
Basis
Differences
 
The
 Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates do not equal the Company’s share of venture-level equity due to various basis differences. Basisdifferences
 related to depreciable assets are being amortized based on the useful lives of the related assets and liabilities, and basis differences related to non–depreciable
 assets, such as land and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are not being amortized. Differences between the Company’s share of venture-level equityand investment balances

a controlling interest in MGM China in 2011.MGM
China
Goodwill
Impairment.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of
 its reporting units, including its MGM China reporting unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair value was lessthan
 its carrying value by 4%. The decrease in fair value resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustaineddecline in the enterp
rise value multiples of the MGM China reporting unit as well as the multiples of the reporting unit’s peer group.As
 a result of the indication of impairment from its step one analysis, the Company performed a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairmentloss. As such,
 the Company determined the fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. The fairvalues of each of the sepa
rately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount, leading to a lower implied fair valueof
 goodwill. Therefore, the Company recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the MGMChina
 reporting unit to its implied fair value. The carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit as of December 31, 2015 following theimpairment charge was $1.4 b
illion.Indefinite-lived

intangible
assets.
The  Company’s  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  development  rights  in  Detroit,  trademarks  ofwhich $210 million related 
to the Mandalay Resort Group trademarks and trade names, and $83 million related to the Borgata trade name, and license rights.MGM

Grand
Paradise

Pursuant  to the agreement dated June 19, 2004 between MGM Grand Paradise and Sociedade de Jogos deMacau, S.A., a gaming subconcession was acqui
red by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period of15
 years commencing on April 20, 2005. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the original terms ofthe
 agreement;  however,  management  believes  that  the  gaming  subconcession  will  be  extended,  given  that  the  Cotai  land  concession  agreement  with  thegovernment
 extends significantly beyond the gaming subconcession. As such, the Company is amortizing the gaming subconcession intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the ter
m of the Cotai land concession, ending in January 2038.  MGM
Macau
land
concession.
MGM Grand  Paradise entered into a contract with the Macau government to use the land under MGM Macau commencingfrom
 April 6, 2006. The land use right has an initial term through April 6, 2031, subject to renewal for additional periods. The land concession intangible asset isamortized on a straight-line 
basis over the remaining initial contractual term.84

 C
ustomer
lists.

 useful life of five years. The MGM China customer list intangible asset became fully amortized in 2016. The Company recognized an intangible assetrelated to the Borgata 
customer list, which is amortized on an accelerated basis over its est imated useful life o f two years and five months.Gaming

licenses.
The  Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Maryland. The consideration paid to the State of Maryland for the license feeof
 $22 million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years, beginning in December 2016, whenthe casino started operations. The Company was granted a
 license to operate a casino in Massachusetts. The consideration paid to the State of Massachusetts for thelicense
 fee of $85 million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning upon the opening of the casinoresort.
Other.
The  Company’s other  finite–lived  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of lease  acquisition  costs amortized  over the life  of the  related  leases,  andcertain license rights amortized 
over their contractual life.  Total

 loan A facility, a $1.82 billion term loan B facility, and a $600 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility and term loan A facility bearinterest
 determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid which results in an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75%. Prior to February 2017,the
 term loan B facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. In February 2017, the Operating Partnership received a reduction of itsterm loan
 B interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% upon achieving a minimum corporate family rating of Ba3/BB-. On May 1, 2017, theOperating

 remain unchanged. The revolving credit facility and the term loan A facility will mature in April 2021 and the term loan B facility will mature in April2023.
 
The
 term loan facilities are subject to amortization of principal in equal quarterly installments, with 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of theterm
 loan A facility and 1.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan B facility to be payable each year. The Operating Partnership permanentlyrepaid

 including that the Operating Partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, maximum total netdebt to
 adjusted assets ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its credit facility covenants at December 31,2017. 
 
The
 Operating Partnership senior credit facility is guaranteed by each of the Operating Partnership’s existing and subsequently acquired direct and indirectwholly
 owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries, and secured by a first priority lien security interest on substantially all of the Operating Partnership’s andsuch restricted subsidia
ries’ material assets, including mortgages on its real estate, subject to customary exclusions, other than that of MGM National Harbor. 
The
 Operating Partnership is party to interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B facility. As of December31,
 2017, the Operating Partnership pays a weighted average fixed rate of 1.844% on total notional amount of $1.2 billion and the variable rate received resetsmonthly
 to  the  one-month  LIBOR  with  no  minimum  floor.  Net  unrealized  gain  on  the  interest  rate  swaps  was  $11  million  as  of  December  31,  2017.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2016 the Operating Partnership had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million outstanding with a weighted average fixed rate of1.825% and a net unrealized g

 facility, which bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum based on HIBOR plus a margin that ranges between 1.375% and 2.5% based on MGM China’sleverage
 ratio. The MGM China credit facility is scheduled to mature in April 2019 with the term loan facilities subject to amortization of principal in quarterlyinstallments as a percentage of the original principal
 amount of 5% due in January 2018, 15% due in each of the subsequent quarters of 2018 and the first quarter of2019,
 and  the  balance  due  at  maturity  in  April  2019.  The  Company  permanently  repaid  $77  million  of  term  loans  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017  inaccordance
 with the scheduled amortization. The MGM China credit facility is secured by MGM Grand Paradise’s interest in the Cotai land use right, and MGMChina,
 MGM Grand Paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility. At December31,
 2017, $832 million was drawn on the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the term loans was 3.71% and theweighted average inter
est rate on the revolving credit facility was 3.57%.87

 The
 MGM  China  credit  facility  contains  customary  representations  and  warr anties,  events  of  default,  and  positive,  negative  and  financial  covenants,including that MGM China mainta
ins compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In February 2017 , the MGM China credit facility was amended to 
inc rease the maximum total  leverage ratio to 6.00 to 1.00 through December 31, 2017, declining to 5.50 to 1.00 at March 31, 2018, 5.00 to1.00 at June 30, 2018, 4.50 to 1.00 at September 30, 2018 and 
thereafter. MGM China was in compliance with its credit fac ility covenants at Dece mber 31, 2017.MGM China is in the
 process of amending its credit facility. The proposed amended facility extends the maturity date, extends the timing of and reduces theamount of scheduled amort
ization payments, and increases the maximum leverage ratio.  MGM

On
 December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TaxAct”).
 The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that will generally be applicable to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017,including, but not
 limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition taxon
 certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) adding anew
 provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (FTCs) and a deduction ofup to
 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (6) imposing additionallimitations on the deduc
tibility of executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits; and (7) increasing bonus depreciation to allow for full expensing ofqualified property.
 
The
 SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118provides a measurement p
eriod that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.In
 accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. Tothe extent
 that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record aprovisional
 estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continueto apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of th
e tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.   
91

 In
 connection with its initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, the  Company’s accounting for certain elements of the Tax Act is incomplete. However,the
 Company was able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects and,  therefore, recorded a provisional discrete  non-cash net tax benefit of $1.4 billion in theperiod
 ended December 31, 2017, consisting of a benefit of $994 million for the corporate rate reduction and a benefit of $438 million from its provisional re-assessment
 of the Tax Act’s impact on the valuation allowance on its foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryovers. The Company did not provide tax expense for thetransition
 tax on its unrepatriated earnings, which totaled $ 669 million without regard to actual 201 7  distributions of $62 million, because  such earnings are fullyoffset
 by FTCs. Furthermore, the Company has made an accounting policy decision to treat taxes due, if any, on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income under theGILTI
 provisions as a current period  expense when incurred. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a deferred tax liability for any GILTI taxes that mayresult in future periods.
 
The
 Company’s  accounting  for  the  impact  of  the  Tax  Act  is  incomplete.  The  Company  was  able  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  impact  on  thevaluation
 allowance against its FTC carryovers and provided the provisional adjustment described above. This amount may be adjusted during the measurementperiod
 as the Company gathers additional information and evaluates any future regulatory or other guidance on items that may impact the valuation allowance,including,
 but not limited to, the computations of foreign derived intangible income and allocations of interest and other expenses to active foreign source income.In
 addition, the Company was not able to make reasonable estimates and provided no provisional amounts for the potential impact, if any, of indirect costs ofproviding certain employ
ee fringe benefits that may be subject to limitation under the Tax Act.   
The
 Company has recorded a provisional valuation allowance of $2.4 billion on its FTC carryover of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 based upon itsinitial assessment of 
future realization under the Tax Act, resulting in an FTC net deferred tax asset of $618 million. The FTCs are attributable to the Macau SpecialGaming
 Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because MGM Grand Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax ongaming profits,
 the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S.taxes.
 While the Company generally does not expect to generate new FTC carryovers under the Tax Act, it will be able to utilize its existing FTC carryovers to theextent that it has ac
tive foreign source income during the 10-year FTC carryforward period. Such foreign source income includes the recapture, to the extent of U.S.taxable
 income, of overall domestic losses that totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2017. The Company relies on future U.S. source operating income in assessingutilization
 of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTC realization during the 10-year FTC carryover period. The FTC carryovers will expire if notutilized as follows: $752 mi
llion in 2022; $976 million in 2023; $787 million in 2024; $331 million in 2025; and $199 million in 2027. 
The
 Company’s assessment of the realization of its FTC deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S.operating
 profits and its initial interpretations of the Tax Act in the absence of regulatory or other clarifying guidance. As a result, significant judgment is requiredin
 assessing  the  possible  need  for  a  valuation  allowance  and  changes  to  such  assumptions  could  result  in  a  material  change  in  the  valuation  allowance  with  acorresponding impact on the p
rovision for income taxes in the period including such change.   
Income
 generated from gaming operations of MGM Grand Paradise, which is owned by MGM China, is exempted from Macau’s 12% complementary tax,pursuant
 to approval from the Macau government. Absent this exemption, “Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $23million and $25 million in 2017 
and 2016, respectively, and diluted earnings per share would have decreased by $0.04 in each year. 
On September 7, 2016, MGM Grand Para
dise was granted an additional extension of the complementary tax exemption through March 31, 2020, concurrentwith the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. A competitor of MGM Gra
nd Paradise subsequently received an additional extension of its exemptionthrough March
 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming concession. Based upon these developments and the uncertaintyconcerning
 taxation after the concession renewal process, the Company has assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau 12% complementary tax ongaming profits for all p
eriods beyond March 31, 2020 and has factored that assumption into the measurement of Macau deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
Non-gaming
 operations  remain  subject  to  the  Macau  complementary  tax.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  had  at  December  31,  2017  a  complementary  tax  netoperating loss
 carryforward of $625 million resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized against non-gaming income in years 2018 through2020.
 
MGM
 Grand Paradise’s exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits toMGM China. However, MGM Grand
 Paradise has had an agreement with the Macau government to settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be dueby
 its shareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment (“annual fee arrangement”) regardless of the amount ofdistributable
 dividends. Such annual fee arrangement was effective for distributions of profits earned through December 31, 2016. MGM China was not subject tothe complementary t
ax on distributions covered by the annual fee arrangement, which required annual payments of $2 million through92

 2016.
 Since  the  earnings  for  2017  were  not  covered  by  an  annual  fee  arrangement  as  of  December  31,  2017,  the Company  provided  deferred  taxes  on  suchearnings,
 which total $41 million as of December 31, 2017. Subsequent to year-end, on February 27, 2018, MGM Grand Paradise was notified of the terms of anextension
 of the annual fee arrangement, which covers the d istributions  of profits earned for the period of January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2020. It will requireannual
 payments of approximately $1 million for 2017 through 2019 and a payment of approximately $300,000 for the first quarter 2020. When the extensio n is executed,
 the Company will reverse the deferred taxes previously recorded on 2017 earnings, which is anticipated to be within the first quarter 2018, resulting in areduction in provision for in
come taxes in such period that will be partially offset b y the 2017 annual payment amount.  
The
 Company  has  net  operating  losses  in  certain  of  the  states  in  which  it  operates  that  total  $708  million  as  of  December  31,  2017,  which  equates  todeferred
 tax assets of $47 million after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance. These net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2021through
 2037.  The  Company  has  provided  a  valuation  allowance  of  $36  million  on  certain  of  its  state  deferred  tax  assets,  including  the  net  operating  lossesdescribed above.
 
In
 addition, there is a valuation allowance of $49 million on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $2 million on Hong Kong netoperating losses because th
e Company believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition. 
A reconciliation of the b
eginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The
 total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $11 million and $9 million  at December 31, 2017and 2016, respectively.
 
The
 Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, which were not material as of December 31,2017,
 2016 or 2015. The Company does not anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 will change materially within thenext twelve months.
 
The
 Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the incometaxes
 paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 31, 2017, the IRS can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2014; howeverthe
 IRS may adjust NOLs generated in such years that were utilized in 2014. The Company’s 2014 U.S. consolidated federal income tax return and the 2014 U.S.income tax
 return of CityCenter Holdings, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income tax purposes are currently under examination by theIRS.
 During 2015, the Company received final approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of the IRS examination of the 2009 tax year andagreed
 to all IRS adjustments to the 2010 and 2011 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC. The Company received a refund of $16 million of taxes and associatedinterest in connection wi
th the settlement of these examinations, which are considered settled for financial accounting purposes. 
As
 of December 31, 2017, other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above, the various state and local tax jurisdictionsin
 which the Company files tax returns can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2013. However, such jurisdictions may adjust NOLs generatedin
 such years that are utilized in subsequent years. Subsequent to year-end, the state of Mississippi informed the Company that it would be opening an audit of the2014
 through 2016 Mississippi tax returns filed by the Company. During 2015, the state of New Jersey completed its examination of Marina District DevelopmentHolding
 Company, LLC for the 2003 through 2009 tax years. All adjustments were agreed to by the members of Marina District Development Holding Company,LLC
 and the examination is now considered settled for financial accounting purposes. The Company made a $1 million payment of tax and associated interest as aresult of this settlement. 
No other state or local income tax returns are currently under examination.

Leases.
The  Company leases real estate and various equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent, capital lease arrangements. Certain real estate leasesprovide for escalation o
f rent based upon a specified price index and/or based upon periodic appraisals. 
At December 31, 2017, the Company was obligat
ed under non-cancellable operating leases to make future minimum lease payments as follows:

The
 table  above  excludes  the  Company’s  future  lease  obligations  to  a  subsidiary  of  the  Operating  Partnership  pursuant  to  the  master  lease  agreementdiscussed
 in Note 18 as these lease obligations are eliminated in consolidation. Rental expense for operating leases was $92 million, $80 million and $74 millionfor
 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which included short-term rentals charged to rent expense as well as $7 million in each of 2017, 2016, 2015 related to theamortization
 of the Cotai land concession.  The Company accounts for the Cotai land concession contract  as an operating  lease for which the required  upfrontpayments are
 amortized over the initial 25-year contract term. Amortization relating to the Cotai land concession is included in “Preopening and start-up expenses”prior to its opening.
 
In
 August 2016, in connection with the Borgata transaction, the  Company has assumed the liability of a series of ground leases for a total of approximately11
 acres of land on which the Borgata employee parking garage, public space expansion, rooms expansion, and modified surface parking lot reside. The Companyrecorded
 an unfavorable lease liability for the excess contractual lease obligations over the market value of the leases, which will be amortized on a straight-linebasis
 over the term of the lease contracts through December 2070. The remaining balance of the unfavorable lease liability was $47 million and $48 million as ofDecember
 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease with rental expense of $6 million and $2 million for the yearsending December 31, 2017 and Decembe
r 31, 2016, respectively. 
In
 April 2013, the Company entered into a ground lease agreement for an approximate 23 acre parcel of land in connection with the MGM National Harborproject.
 The ground lease has an initial term of 25 years and the right to extend for up to 13 additional six year periods with the first 7 of those additional periodsconsidered
 to be reasonably assured. The Company therefore amortizes the lease on a straight line basis over a 67 year term. The  ground lease is accounted for asan
 operating lease with rental expense of $16 million, $16 million and $19 million recorded for  the years ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Rent recognized for the ground 
lease was recorded in "Preopening and start-up expenses" prior to its opening in December 2016 .  
Borgata

property
tax
reimbursement
agreement.
On  February 15, 2017, Borgata, the Department of Community Affairs of the State of New Jersey andAtlantic
 City entered into an agreement wherein Borgata was to be reimbursed $72 million as settlement for property tax refunds in satisfaction of New Jersey TaxCourt and Superior Court judgments tot
aling approximately $106 million, plus interest for the 2009-2012 tax years and the settlement of pending tax appeals for thetax
 years 2013-2015. Those pending tax appeals could potentially have resulted in Borgata being awarded additional refunds due of approximately $65 million. InJune
 2017, Atlantic City and the State of New Jersey issued bonds and used the proceeds to pay the $72 million settlement in full. The Company recorded theamounts
 received pursuant to the reimbursement agreement as an offset to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Asrequired
 by the purchase and sale agreement to acquire Borgata in August 2016, the Company paid Boyd Gaming half of the settlement amount received by theCompany,
 net  of  fees  and  expenses.  Amounts  paid  to  Boyd  Gaming  were  recorded  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  ofoperations.
 
NV

Energy.
In  July 2016, the Company filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and now purchases energy, capacity, and/orancillary
 services  from  a  provider  other  than  NV  Energy.  The  Company  paid  an  upfront  impact  payment  of  $83  million,  including  $14  million  related  toCityCenter,
 in September 2016. Under the terms of the exit agreement, the Company and CityCenter were required to make ongoing payments to NV Energy fornon-bypassable
 rate charges, which primarily relate to each entity’s share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energy contracts which extended through 2040and each entity’s share o
f the costs of decommissioning and remediation of coal-fired power plants in Nevada. The Company’s initial estimate of its obligation94

 related
 to non-bypassable charges was $71 million. The expense recognized related to the upfront payment and the initial acc rual  for the liability associated withthe
 non-bypassable charges was recorded within “NV Energy exit expense” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December31, 2016.
 Subsequent accretion of the liability and changes in estimates  are recognized within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement ofoperations.
 In the second quarter of 2017, the terms of the ongoing impact fee obligations were modified. Such modifications included a credit to be appli ed against future non-bypassable rate charges and substantiall
y shortened the period over which the Company and CityCenter are responsible for such charges, with anend
 date in 2022. As such, the Company recognized a reduction in its liability for future c harges  of $41 million with a corresponding credit to “NV Energy exitexpense”.
 Additionally,  CityCenter  recorded  an  $8  million  reduction  in  liability  and  credit  to  expense.  As  of  December  31,  2017  and  2016,  the  Company  hasrecorded
 an estimate of its remai ning  liability on a discounted basis of $10 million and $8 million, respectively, in “Other accrued liabilities” and $23 million and$63 million, respective
ly, in “Other long-term obligations.” 
Grand

Paradise
Macau
deferred
cash
payment.
On  September  1,  2016,  the  Company  purchased  188.1  million  common  shares  of  its  MGM  Chinasubsidiary
 from  Grand  Paradise  Macau  (“GPM”),  an  entity  controlled  by  Ms.  Ho,  Pansy  Catilina  Chiu  King  (“Ms.  Ho”).  As  part  of  the  consideration  for  thepurchase, the Company agreed to p
ay GPM a deferred cash payment of $50 million, which will be paid in amounts equal to the ordinary dividends received on suchshares, with a final lump sum payment due
 on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the transaction if any portion of the deferred cash payment remains unpaidat
 that time. In 2017, the total amount paid under the deferred cash payment arrangement was $7 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded aremaining liabili
ty on a discounted basis of $39 million in “Other long-term obligations.”   
T-Mobile

credit
facility.
The  Company is party to a repayment guarantee for the term loan B facility under the Las Vegas Arena Company’ssenior credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the term loan B out
standing balance was $50 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company does not believe it isprobable that it will ne
ed to perform on the guarantee. 
Other

guarantees.
The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  party  to  various  guarantee  contracts  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  which  are  generallysupported
 by letters of credit issued by financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $250million,
 MGP’s senior credit facility limits the amount to $75 million, and MGM China’s credit facility limits the amount to $100 million. At December 31, 2017,$15
 million  in  letters  of  credit  were  outstanding  under  the  Company’s  senior  credit  facility  and  $39  million  in  letters  of  credit  were  outstanding  under  MGMChina’s
 credit facility. No letters of credit were outstanding under the MGP senior credit facility at December 31, 2017. The amount of available borrowings undereach of the credit facilities is re
duced by any outstanding letters of credit. 
October
1
litigation.
The  Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the October 1, 2017shooting
 in Las Vegas. The matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues, in each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seekingdamages
 for emotional distress, physical injury, medical expenses, economic damages and/or wrongful death based on assertions that the Company and/or certainof
 its subsidiaries were negligent. Pending lawsuits were first filed in October 2017 and include actions filed by multiple individuals in the District Court of ClarkCounty, Nevada
 and in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. Some of the original actions have been voluntarily dismissed, and plaintiffs’ counselindicate they anticipate re-filing t
he lawsuits in similar form. Additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future. 
The
 Company is currently unable to reliably predict the developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of pending or futurelitigation
 related to this matter. The Company will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses, and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events,new
 information and future circumstances. The Company intends to defend against these lawsuits and ultimately believes it should prevail, but litigation of thistype
 is inherently unpredictable. Although there are significant procedural, factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect the Company’sbelief
 as to the possibility of liability, the Company currently believes that it is reasonably possible that it could incur liability in connection with certain of theselawsuits.
 The foregoing determination was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admissionof
 any liability on the part of the Company or any of its affiliates. Given that these cases are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them,the
 Company does not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability. In the event the Company incurs any liability,the
 Company believes it is unlikely it would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of its insurance coverage. In addition, the Company’s generalliability
 insurance coverage provides, as part of the contractual “duty to defend”, payment of legal fees and associated costs incurred to defend covered lawsuitsthat
 are  filed  arising  from  the  October  1,  2017  shooting  in  Las  Vegas.  Payment  of  such  fees  and  costs  is  in  addition  to  (and  not  limited  by)  the  limits  of  theinsurance policies and
 does not erode the total liability coverage available. The insurance carriers have not expressed any reservation of rights or coverage defensesthat indicate they dispu
te coverage under the applicable policies. 
95

 Other
litigation.
The  Company is a party to various other legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Managementdoes not believe that the ou
t come of such proceedings will h ave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

PLANS 
Multiemployer

benefit
plans.
The  Company currently participates in multiemployer pension plans in which the risks of participating differs from single-employer plans in the fol
lowing aspects: 
 
a) Assets contributed to the mul tiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; 
b) If  a  participating  employer  stops  contributing  to  the  plan,  the  unfunded  obligations  of  the  plan  may  be  borne  by  the  remaining  participatingemployers;
 
c) If  an entity chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the entity may be required to pay those plans an amount based on theunderfunded status of the plan, 
referred to as a withdrawal liability; and 
d) If  the plan is terminated by withdrawal of all employers and if the value of the nonforfeitable benefits exceeds plan assets and withdrawal liabilitypayments, employers are re
quired by law to make up the insufficient difference. 
The Company’s participation 
in these plans is presented below.

(2) The zone  status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan's actuary. Plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded(critical status) and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded.
 
(3) Indicates plans for which a Financial Improvement Plan (FIP) or a Rehabilitation Plan (RP) is either pending or has been imp lemented. 
(4) There  have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of contributions, other than those for the Legacy Plan of the National Retirement Fund which reflect theperiod from acquisition of Borgata of August 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 within the 2016 column and a full-year of contributions within the 2017 column.
 
(5) The  Company is party to ten collective bargaining agreements (CBA) that require contributions. The agreements between CityCenter Hotel Casino, LLC, Bellagio, MandalayCorp.,
 MGM Grand Hotel, LLC and the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas are the most significant because more than half of the Company’s employee participants inthis plan are covered by those four agreements.

SEGMENT
INFORMATION
The
 Company’s management views each of its casino resorts as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economiccharacteristics,
 types  of  customers,  types  of  services  and  products  provided,  the  regulatory  environments  in  which  they  operate,  and  their  management  andreporting
 structure.  The  Company’s  principal  operating  activities  occur  in  two  geographic  regions:  the  United  States  and  Macau  S.A.R.  The  Company  hasaggregated
 its  operations  into  two  reportable  segments  based  on  the  similar  characteristics  of  the  operating  segments:  domestic  resorts  and  MGM  China.  TheCompany’s
 operations related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate operations and management services have not been identifiedas
 separate reportable segments; therefore, these operations are included in “Corporate and other” in the following segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidatedresults.
The Company’s management utilizes Adjusted Property
 EBITDA as the primary profit measure for its reportable segments. Adjusted Property EBITDA is ameasure
 defined as Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the Omnibus Plan and the MGM Growth PropertiesOmnibus
 Incentive Plan, which are not allocated to the reportable segments or each operating segment, as applicable. MGM China recognizes stock compensationexpense
 related to the MGM China Share Option Plan which is included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for MGM China. Adjusted EBITDA is a measuredefined
 as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, NV Energyexit expense, gain on Borgata t
ransaction, goodwill impairment charges, and property transactions, net.99

As
 further described in Note 1, pursuant to the master lease, the tenant leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-NewYork,
 Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage from the landlord. On August 1, 2016, Borgata was added tothe existing master l
ease and, on October 5, 2017, MGM National Harbor was also added to the existing master lease. 
The
 master lease has an initial lease term of ten years beginning on April 25, 2016 (other than with respect to MGM National Harbor, as described below)with
 the potential to extend the term for four additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the tenant. The master lease provides that any extension of itsterm
 must apply to all of the real estate under the master lease at the time of the extension. The master lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the tenant topay
 substantially  all  costs  associated  with  the  lease,  including  real  estate  taxes,  insurance,  utilities  and  routine  maintenance,  in  addition  to  the  base  rent.Additionally,
 the  master  lease  provides  the  landlord  with  a  right  of  first  offer  with  respect  to  the  Company’s  development  property  located  in  Springfield,Massachusetts,
 which  the  landlord  may  exercise  should  the  Company  elect  to  sell  this  property  in  the  future.  In  connection  with  the  MGM  National  Harbortransaction, the
 master lease was amended to provide that the initial term with respect to MGM National Harbor ends on April 31, 2024. Thereafter, the initial termof the
 master lease with respect to MGM National Harbor may be renewed at the option of the tenant for an initial renewal period lasting until the earlier of the endof the then-current term of t
he master lease or101

 the
 next renewal term (depending on whether MGM elects to renew the other properties under the master lease in  connection with the expiration of the initial ten-year
 term). If, however, the tenant chooses not to renew the lease with respect to MGM National Harbor after the initial MGM National Harbor term under themaster
 Lease, the tenant would also lose the r ight  to renew the master lease with respect to the rest of the properties when the initial ten-year lease term endsrelated to the rest o
f the properties in 2026. 
The
 initial  annual  rent  under  the  master  lease,  for  the  first  lease  year  commencing  April  25,  2016,  was  $550  million.  In  connection  with  the  Borgatatransaction
 on August 1, 2016, total annual rent under the master lease increased to $650 million. In connection with the commencement of the second lease yearon
 April  1,  2017,  the  total  annual  rent  under  the  master  lease  increased  to  $662  million.  Then,  in  connection  with  the  MGM  National  Harbor  Transaction  onOctober 5, 2017, the total annual rent payments under the
 master lease for the second lease year increased to $757 million. Rent under the master lease consists of a“base
 rent” component and a “percentage rent” component. As of December 31, 2017, the base rent represents approximately 90% of the rent payments due underthe
 master lease and the percentage rent represents approximately 10% of the rent payments due under the master lease. The  master lease also provides for fixedannual escalators
 of 2% on the base rent in the second through sixth years and the possibility for additional 2% increases thereafter subject to the tenant meeting anadjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as well as potential increases in percentage rent in year six and every five years thereafter ba
sed on a percentage of average actualannual
 net revenue during the preceding five year period calculated in accordance with the terms under the master lease. The  master lease also contains customaryevents of default and fin
ancial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2017.All
 intercompany transactions, including transactions under the master lease, have been eliminated in the Company’s consolidation of MGP. The publicownership of MGP’s Class A shares is recognized 
as non-controlling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 respective  investment  under  the  equity  method  within  the  condensed  consolidating  financial  information  presented  below.  For  these  subsidiaries,  suchinvestment

 assets  are  also  reflected  on  the  balance  sheet  of  the  MGP  subsidiary  that  received  such  assets  in  connection  with  the  contribution.  The  condensedconsolidating
 financial  information  presented  below  therefore  includes  the  accounting  for  such  activity  within  the  respective  columns  presented  and  in  theelimination

 been  retrospectively  adjusted  to  conform  prior  periods  to  the  current  presentation,  as  the  transactions  occurred  between  entities,  which  are  consideredbusinesses
 under common control. Accordingly, the real estate assets and associated operations in all periods prior to the IPO date were reclassified to conform tothe current organiza

date of ______________ (the “Effective Date”).
RECITALS
A. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has adopted the Company’s 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as
amended (the “Plan”), which provides for the granting of Restricted Stock Units (as that term is defined in Section 1 below) to
selected service providers. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement shall have the same meanings as in the Plan.
B. The Board believes that the grant of Restricted Stock Units will stimulate the interest of selected employees in, and
strengthen their desire to remain with, the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary (as those terms are hereinafter defined).
C. The Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) has authorized the grant of Restricted Stock Units to the
Participant pursuant to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement.
D. The Committee and the Participant intend that the Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof and shall supersede any other agreements, representations or understandings
(whether oral or written and whether express or implied, and including, without limitation, any employment agreement between the
Participant and the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or Subsidiary) whether previously
entered into, currently effective or entered into in the future) which relate to the subject matter hereof.
Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:
1. 
Definitions . 1.1 “Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1.2 “Employer” means the Company, the Subsidiaries and any Parent and affiliated companies, but specifically excludes
Tracinda Corporation, its stockholder or stockholders, and its subsidiaries.
1.3 “Fair Market Value” means the closing price of a share of Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
or other applicable established stock exchange or over the

 counter market on the applicable date of determination, or if no closing price was reported on such date, the first trading day
immediately preceding the applicable date of determination on which such a closing price was reported. In the event shares of Stock
are not publicly traded at the time a determination of their value is required to be made hereunder, the determination of their Fair
Market Value shall be made by the Committee in such manner as it deems appropriate.
1.4 “Parent” means a parent corporation as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code.
1.5 “Restricted Stock Unit” means an award granted to a Participant pursuant to Article 8 of the Plan, except that no shares
of Stock are actually awarded or granted to the Participant on the date of grant.
1.6 “Section 409A” means Section 409A of the Code, and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder to the
extent applicable.
1.7 “Stock” means the Company’s common stock, $.01 par value per share.

2. 
Grant to Participant . The Company hereby grants to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, an award of ______________ Restricted Stock Units. Except as otherwise set forth in the Plan or this Agreement,
each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one (1) share of Stock in respect thereof that shall be paid to the Participant
within thirty (30) days following the earlier to occur of (i) a change of control (as defined in the Company’s Change of Control
Policy for Executive Officers, as amended from time to time, provided such change of control meets the definition of a change in
control event for purposes of Section 409A and (ii) the third anniversary of the Effective Date.
3. 
Terms and Conditions . 3.1 
Vesting . The Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested as of the date of grant and shall not be subject to forfeiture in the event Participant’s employment with Employer terminates for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, the Restricted Stock Units
shall be paid out under Section 2 notwithstanding any prior termination of employment.
3.2 
Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents . (i)    Participant will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Stock subject to Restricted
Stock Units until the shares of Stock relating thereto have been issued and recorded on the records of the Company or its
transfer agent or registrars.
(ii)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this award shall accrue dividend equivalents with respect to dividends that
would otherwise be paid on the shares of Stock underlying the award during the period from the Effective Date to the date
such underlying shares of Stock are delivered. Any such dividend equivalent shall be deemed reinvested in additional full
and
2

 fractional Restricted Stock Units immediately upon the related dividend’s payment date, based on the then-
current Fair Market Value, and shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other conditions applicable to the
Restricted Stock Units on which such dividend equivalents are paid. Any fractional shares shall be paid in cash upon the
settlement of such Restricted Share Units.
3.3 
Limits on Transferability . The Restricted Stock Units granted under this Agreement may be transferred solely to a trust in which the Participant or the Participant’s spouse control the management of the assets. Any transfer of Restricted Stock Units
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement and the transferee shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as if it were the Participant. No interest of the Participant under this Agreement shall be subject to attachment, execution,
garnishment, sequestration, the laws of bankruptcy or any other legal or equitable process.
3.4 
Adjustments . If there is any change in the Stock by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination or exchange of shares of Stock, or any similar change affecting the Stock the Committee
will make appropriate and proportionate adjustments (including relating to the Stock, other securities, cash or other consideration
which may be acquired upon payment or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units) that it deems necessary to the number and class of
securities subject to the Restricted Stock Units and any other terms of this Agreement. Any adjustment so made shall be final and
binding upon the Participant.
3.5 
No Right to Continued Performance of Services . The grant of the Restricted Stock Units does not confer upon the Participant any right to continue to be employed by the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or
Subsidiary) nor may it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any
Parent or Subsidiary) for which the Participant performs services to terminate the Participant’s employment at any time.
3.6 
Compliance With Law and Regulations . The grant of Restricted Stock Units and the obligation of the Company to issue shares of Stock under this Agreement are subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations, including those
related to disclosure of financial and other information to the Participant and to approvals by any government or regulatory agency as
may be required. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates for shares of Stock prior to (A) the listing of
such shares on any stock exchange on which the Stock may then be listed and (B) the completion of any registration or qualification
of such shares under any federal or state law, or any rule or regulation of any government body which the Company shall, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.
3.7 
Corporate Transaction . Subject to Section 2, upon the occurrence of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, or similar transaction, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the applicable rules and

provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under
Section 409A. If any provision of this Agreement or the Plan contravenes Section 409A or could cause the Participant to incur any
tax, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion and without the Participant’s consent, modify
such provision in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A or to satisfy the conditions of any exception therefrom, or

409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like
terms shall mean “separation from service.” If the Participant is deemed on the date of termination to be a “specified employee”
within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit
that is considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a “separation from service,” such
payment or benefit shall be made or provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period
measured from the date of such “separation from service” of the Participant, and (ii) the date of the Participant’s death (the “Delay
Period”). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 19.2 (whether they
would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed on the
first business day following the expiration of the Delay Period to the Participant in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and
benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
19.3 For purposes of Section 409A, the Participant’s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a
payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., “payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of
termination”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.

Exhibit
10.5(40) 
EXHIBIT A
ARBITRATION
This
Exhibit
A
sets
forth
the
methods
for
resolving
disputes
should
any
arise
under
the
Agreement,
and
accordingly,
this
Exhibit
A
shall
be
considered
a
part
of
the
Agreement.
1.    Except for a claim by either Participant or the Company for injunctive relief where such would be otherwise
authorized by law, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach hereof including without
limitation any claim involving the interpretation or application of the Agreement or the Plan, shall be submitted to binding arbitration
in accordance with the employment arbitration rules then in effect of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (“JAMS”), to the
extent not inconsistent with this paragraph. This Exhibit A covers any claim Participant might have against any officer, director,
employee, or agent of the Company, or any of the Company’s subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates, and all successors and assigns of
any of them. The promises by the Company and Participant to arbitrate differences, rather than litigate them before courts or other
bodies, provide consideration for each other, in addition to other consideration provided under the Agreement.
2.     
Claims Subject to Arbitration . This Exhibit A contemplates mandatory arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. Only claims that are justiciable under applicable state or federal law are covered by this Exhibit A. Such claims include any and
all alleged violations of any state or federal law whether common law, statutory, arising under regulation or ordinance, or any other
law, brought by any current or former employees.
3.     
Non-Waiver of Substantive Rights . This Exhibit A does not waive any rights or remedies available under applicable statutes or common law. However, it does waive Participant’s right to pursue those rights and remedies in a judicial forum. By
signing the Agreement and the acknowledgment at the end of this Exhibit A, the undersigned Participant voluntarily agrees to
arbitrate his or her claims covered by this Exhibit A.
4.     
Time Limit to Pursue Arbitration; Initiation : To ensure timely resolution of disputes, Participant and the Company must initiate arbitration within the statute of limitations (deadline for filing) provided for by applicable law pertaining to the claim.
The failure to initiate arbitration within this time limit will bar any such claim. The parties understand that the Company and
Participant are waiving any longer statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply, and any aggrieved party is encouraged to give
written notice of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences may take place
promptly. The parties agree that the aggrieved party must, within the time frame provided by this Exhibit A, give written notice of a
claim pursuant to Section 7 of the Agreement. In the event such notice is to be provided to the Company, the Participant shall
provide a copy of such notice of a claim to the Company’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Written notice shall
identify and describe the nature of the claim, the supporting facts and the relief or remedy sought.

 5.     
Selecting an Arbitrator : This Exhibit A mandates Arbitration under the then current rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) regarding employment disputes. The arbitrator shall be either a retired judge or an attorney
experienced in employment law and licensed to practice in the state in which arbitration is convened. The parties shall select one
arbitrator from among a list of three qualified neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS. If the parties are unable to agree on the
arbitrator, each party shall strike one name and the remaining named arbitrator shall be selected.
6.     
Representation/Arbitration Rights and Procedures : a.    Participant may be represented by an attorney of his/her choice at his/her own expense.
b.    The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Nevada (without
regard to its choice of law provisions) and/or federal law when applicable. In all cases, this Exhibit A shall provide for the
broadest level of arbitration of claims between the Company and Participant under Nevada or applicable federal law. The
arbitrator is without jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or law of remedies.
c.    The arbitrator shall have no authority to award non-economic damages or punitive damages except where
such relief is specifically authorized by an applicable state or federal statute or common law. In such a situation, the
arbitrator shall specify in the award the specific statute or other basis under which such relief is granted.
d.    The applicable law with respect to privilege, including attorney-client privilege, work product, and offers to
compromise must be followed.
e.    The parties shall have the right to conduct reasonable discovery, including written and oral (deposition)
discovery and to subpoena and/or request copies of records, documents and other relevant discoverable information
consistent with the procedural rules of JAMS. The arbitrator shall decide disputes regarding the scope of discovery and
shall have authority to regulate the conduct of any hearing and/or trial proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the right to
entertain a motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment.
f.    The parties shall exchange witness lists at least 30 days prior to the trial/hearing procedure. The arbitrator
shall have subpoena power so that either Participant or the Company may summon witnesses. The arbitrator shall use the
Federal Rules of Evidence. Both parties have the right to file a post hearing brief. Any party, at its own expense, may
arrange for and pay the cost of a court reporter to provide a stenographic record of the proceedings.
g.    Any arbitration hearing or proceeding shall take place in private, not open to the public, in Las Vegas,
Nevada.
7.     
Arbitrator’s Award : The arbitrator shall issue a written decision containing the specific issues raised by the parties, the specific findings of fact, and the specific conclusions of law. The award shall be rendered promptly, typically within 30 days after
conclusion of the arbitration hearing, or the submission of post-hearing briefs if requested. The arbitrator may not award any relief or
remedy in excess of what a court could grant under applicable law. The
11

 arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on both parties. Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having competent jurisdiction.
a.    Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this
Exhibit A and to enforce an arbitration award.
b.    In the event of any administrative or judicial action by any agency or third party to adjudicate a claim on
behalf of Participant which is subject to arbitration under this Exhibit A, Participant hereby waives the right to participate
in any monetary or other recovery obtained by such agency or third party in any such action, and Participant’s sole remedy
with respect to any such claim shall be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit A.
8.     
Fees and Expenses : The Company shall be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator; provided, however, that if Participant is the party initiating the claim, Participant will contribute an amount equal to the
filing fee to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which Participant is (or was last) employed by the
Company. Participant and the Company shall each pay for their own expenses, attorney’s fees (a party’s responsibility for his/her/its
own attorney’s fees is only limited by any applicable statute specifically providing that attorney’s fees may be awarded as a remedy),
and costs and fees regarding witness, photocopying and other preparation expenses. If any party prevails on a statutory claim that
affords the prevailing party attorney’s fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorney’s fees and/or costs, the
arbitrator may award reasonable attorney’s fees and/or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply
under the law applicable to the claim(s).
9.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A shall survive the termination of Participant’s employment with the
Company and the expiration of the Agreement. These arbitration provisions can only be modified or revoked in a writing signed by
both parties and which expressly states an intent to modify or revoke the provisions of this Exhibit A.
10.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A do not alter or affect the termination provisions of this Agreement.
11.    Capitalized terms not defined in this Exhibit A shall have the same definition as in the Agreement to which this is
Exhibit A.
12.    If any provision of this Exhibit A is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such
adjudication shall not affect the validity of the remainder of Exhibit A. All other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

en notice of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences may take place promptly. Theparties agree that

law. The award shall be render ed promptly, typically within 30 days after conclusion of the arbitration hearing, or the submission of post-hearing briefs ifrequested. The arbitra
tor may not award any relief or remedy in excess of what a court could grant under applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision is final andbinding on both parties.. Judgment upon an 
award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. 
  
a. Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Exhibit A and to enforce an arbitrationaward.

ibit A, Participant hereby waives the right to participate in any monetary or other recovery obtained by such agency or third party in anysuch action, and Participan
t’s sole remedy with respect to any such claim shall be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit A.

r/its own attorney’s fees is only limited by any applicable statute specifically providing that attorney’s fees may be awarded as a remedy),and costs and fees regarding wi

r if there is a written agreement providing for attorney’s fees and/or costs, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorney’s fees and/orcosts to the prevailing pa
rty, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim(s).

 (collectively, the “Nevada Act”), and various local regulations. Our gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the NevadaGaming
 Commission (the “Nevada Commission”), the Nevada State Gaming Control Board (the “Nevada Board”), and various county and city licensing agencies(the “local authori
ties”). The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board, and the local authorities are collectively referred to as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.” 
The
 laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with,among other things:
 
 
• the prevention of unsavory or unsui table persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 
 
• the establishment and m aintenance of responsible accounting practices; 
 
• the  maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscalaffairs and the safegu
arding of assets and revenues; 
 
• providing reliable re cord keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; 
 
• the prevention of cheat ing and fraudulent practices; and 
 
• providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. 
Any change in the laws, regulations, 
and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations. 
Each
 of our subsidiaries that currently operate casinos in Nevada (collectively, the “Nevada casino licensees”) is required to be licensed by the NevadaGaming
 Authorities. Each gaming license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable. MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, New York-New YorkHotel
 & Casino, LLC, Bellagio, LLC, MGM Resorts Manufacturing Corp., and Aria Resort & Casino, LLC are also licensed as manufacturers and distributors ofgaming
 devices  (collectively,  the  “Nevada  manufacturer  and  distributor  licensees”).  Certain  of  our  subsidiaries  have  also  been  licensed  or  found  suitable  asshareholders,
 members, or general partners, as relevant, of the Nevada casino licensees and of the Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees. The Nevadacasino licensees, Nevada m
anufacturer and distributor licensees, and the foregoing subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Nevada licensed subsidiaries.” 
We, along
 with Mandalay Resort Group, are required to be registered by the Nevada Commission as publicly traded corporations (collectively, the “Nevadaregistered corporations”)
 and Mirage Resorts, Incorporated is required to be registered as an intermediary company and, as such, each of us is required periodicallyto submit detailed fin
ancial and operating reports to the Nevada 

 Commission
 and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require. No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive anypercentage
 of profits from, the Nevada licensed subsidiaries without first registering with (for equity ownership of 5% or less), or obtaining licenses and approvalsfrom
 the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Additionally, the local authorities have taken the position that they have the authority to approve all persons owning orcontrolling
 the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming licensee. The Nevada registered corporations, Mirage Resorts, Incorporated and the Nevada licensedsubsidiaries
 have obtained from the Nevada Gaming Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits, and licenses required in order to engage in gamingactivities in Nevada.
 
The
 Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, the Nevada registeredcorporations
 or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaminglicensee.
 Officers, directors, and certain key employees of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may berequired
 to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Officers, directors, and key employees of the Nevada registered corporations who are actively anddirectly
 involved in the gaming activities of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.The
 Nevada Gaming Authorities may deny an application for licensing or a finding of suitability for any cause they deem reasonable. A finding of suitability iscomparable
 to  licensing,  and  both  require  submission  of  detailed  personal  and  financial  information  followed  by  a  thorough  investigation.  The  applicant  forlicensing
 or a finding of suitability, or the gaming licensee by which the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of theinvestigation.
 Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities, and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for afinding of suitability or 
licensure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position. 
If
 the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with theNevada registered corpor
ations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries, such Nevada registered corporations or Nevada licensed subsidiaries, as applicable, would haveto
 sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Commission may require the Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiariesto
 terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are notsubject to judicial r
eview in Nevada. 
The
 Nevada  registered  corporations  and  the  Nevada  casino  licensees  are  required  to  submit  detailed  financial  and  operating  reports  to  the  NevadaCommission.
 Substantially all of the Nevada registered corporations’ and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries’ material loans, leases, sales of securities, and similarfinancing transactions 
must be reported to or approved by the Nevada Commission. 
If
 the  Nevada  Commission  determined  that  we  or  a  Nevada  licensed  subsidiary  violated  the  Nevada  Act,  it  could  limit,  condition,  suspend,  or  revoke,subject
 to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures, our gaming licenses and those of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries. In addition, the Nevadaregistered corporations and the Nevada licensed sub
sidiaries and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the NevadaAct
 at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the gaming establishments and,under certain
 circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the gaming establishments) could beforfeited
 to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning, or suspension of any gaming license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of anygaming license would) mat
erially adversely affect our gaming operations. 
Any
 beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and havehis or her suitability as 
a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwisebe
 inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities inconducting any such investigat
ion. 
The
 Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission.The
 Nevada Act requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitabilitywithin
 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” asdefined in
 the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of any class of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for awaiver of such finding of suitab
ility if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtaineda waiver may, in certa
in circumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver. 
An institutional investor will
 be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes if it acquires and holds the voting securities in the ordinary courseof
 business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors,any change in our corporate 
charter, bylaws, management, policies, or 
2

 operations,
 or  any  of  our  gaming  affiliates,  or  any  other  action  that  the  Nevada  Commission  finds  to  be  inconsistent  with  holding  our  voting  securities  forinvestment purposes only. Activi
ties that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: 
 
• voting on all matters vot ed on by stockholders; 
 
• making  financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause achange in its managemen
t, policies, or operations; and 
 
• such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 
If
 the beneficial holder of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, or trust, it must submit detailed business and financialinformation including a 
list of beneficial owners. The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation. 
Any
 person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission orthe
 Chairman  of  the  Nevada  Board,  or  who  refuses  or  fails  to  pay  the  investigative  costs  incurred  by  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  in  connection  withinvestigation
 of its application, may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions  apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify thebeneficial
 owner. Any stockholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our common stock beyond such period oftime as may be prescr
ibed by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that aperson is unsuitable to be a sto
ckholder or to have any other relationship with us or a Nevada licensed subsidiary, we or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries: 
 
• pays that person any dividend or in terest upon any of our voting securities; 
 
• allows that person to exerc ise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; 
 
• pays remuneration in any fo rm to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or 
 
• fails  to  pursue  all  lawful  efforts  to  require  such  unsuitable  person  to  relinquish  his  or  her  voting  securities  including  if  necessary,  the  immediatepurchase of the voting secur
ities for cash at fair market value. 
The
 Nevada  Commission  may,  in  its  discretion,  require  the  holder  of  any  debt  security  of  the  Nevada  registered  corporations  to  file  an  application,  beinvestigated,
 and be found suitable to hold the debt security. If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuantto the Nevada Act, the regist
ered corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it: 
 
• pays to the unsuitable person any d ividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever; 
 
• recognizes any voting right by su ch unsuitable person in connection with such securities; 
 
• pays the unsuitable person re muneration in any form; or 
 
• makes any payment to the unsui table person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation, or similar transaction. 
We are required to m
aintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are heldin trust
 by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failureto make
 such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity ofthe
 beneficial owner. The Nevada Commission has the power to require the Nevada registered corporations’ stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that suchsecurities are subje
ct to the Nevada Act. However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on the Nevada registered corporations. 
The
 Nevada registered corporations may not make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securitiesor
 the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire, or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for thosepurposes or for similar purpos
es. An approval, if given, does not 
3

 constitute
 a  finding,  recommendation,  or  approval  by  the  Nevada  Commission  or  the  Nevada  Board  as  to  the  accuracy  or  adequacy  of  the  prospectus  or  theinvestment merits of 
the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. 
On
 July 27, 2017, the Nevada Commission granted the Nevada registered corporations prior approval to make public offerings for a period of three years,subject to certain cond
itions. 
Changes
 in control of the Nevada registered corporations through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements,or
 any act or conduct by a person whereby he or she obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission. Entities seeking toacquire control of a r
egistered corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assumingcontrol
 of the registered corporation. The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other persons having a materialrelationship or involvem
ent with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction. 
The
 Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities, and corporate defensivetactics
 affecting Nevada gaming licensees and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations may be injurious to stable and productive corporategaming.
 The  Nevada  Commission  has  established  a  regulatory  scheme  to  ameliorate  the  potentially  adverse  effects  of  these  business  practices  upon  Nevada’sgaming industry and to furthe
r Nevada’s policy to: 
 
• assure the financial stability  of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates; 
 
• preserve the benefic ial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and 
 
• promote a neutral environme nt for the orderly governance of corporate affairs. 
Approvals
 are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above thecurrent
 market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan ofrecapitalization proposed
 by a registered corporation’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the registered corporation’s stockholders forthe purpose of acquiring cont
rol of that corporation. 
License
 fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the localauthorities. Depending upon the pa
rticular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly, or annually and are based upon either: 
 
• a percentage of the gross revenues received; 
 
• the number of gaming devic es operated; or 
 
• the number of table gam es operated. 
The
 tax on gross revenues received is generally 6.75%. A live entertainment tax is also paid on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms oflive entertainmen
t are provided. The Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada. 
Because we are involved in gaming ventures outside of Neva
da, we are required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fundin
 the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Board of our participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject toincrease
 or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by theNevada Act. We would be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if we: 
 
• knowingly violate any laws of the fo reign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation; 
 
• fail to conduct the for eign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations; 
 
4

  
• engage  in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada,reflects or tends to r
eflect discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada; 
 
• engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or 
 
• employ, contract with,  or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevadaon the ground of personal unsuitabi
lity, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling. 
The
 sale of alcoholic beverages by the Nevada licensed subsidiaries is subject to licensing, control, and regulation by the applicable local authorities. Alllicenses
 are  revocable  and  are  not  transferable.  The  agencies  involved  have  full  power  to  limit,  condition,  suspend,  or  revoke  any  such  license,  and  any  suchdisciplinary action cou
ld (and revocation would) have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
Michigan
Government
Regulation
and
Taxation
 
The
 Michigan  Gaming  Control  and  Revenue  Act  (the  “Michigan  Act”)  subjects  the  owners  and  operators  of  casino  gaming  facilities  to  extensive  statelicensing
 and regulatory requirements. The Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of Detroit, provided that any suchlocal ordinances regulating casino gaming are
 consistent with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it. We are subject to the Michigan Act throughour
 ownership  interest  in  MGM  Grand  Detroit,  LLC  (the  “licensed  subsidiary”)  which  operates  MGM  Grand  Detroit.  Our  ownership  interest  in  MGM  GrandDetroit, LLC is held by our wholly-owned subsidia
ry MGM Grand Detroit, Inc. 
The
 Michigan Act creates the Michigan Gaming Control Board (the “Michigan Board”) and authorizes it to grant casino licenses to not more than threeapplicants
 who have entered into development agreements with the City of Detroit. The Michigan Board is granted extensive authority to conduct backgroundinvestigations
 and  determine  the  suitability  of  casino  license  applicants,  affiliated  companies,  officers,  directors,  or  managerial  employees  of  applicants  andaffiliated
 companies and persons or entities holding a one percent or greater direct or indirect interest in an applicant or affiliated company. Institutional investorsholding
 less than certain specified amounts of our debt or equity securities are exempted from meeting the suitability requirements of the Michigan Act since weare
 a publicly traded corporation, and provided that the securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of influencing or affectingour
 affairs. Any person who supplies goods or services to the licensed subsidiary which are directly related to, used in connection with, or affecting gaming, andany
 person who supplies other goods or services to the licensed subsidiary on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license from the MichiganBoard.
 In  addition,  any  individual  employed  by  the  licensed  subsidiary  or  by  a  supplier  licensee  whose  work  duties  are  related  to  or  involved  in  the  gamingoperation or are performed i
n a restricted area or a gaming area of the licensed subsidiary must obtain an occupational license from the Michigan Board. 
The
 Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license. The applicantmust
 establish  its  suitability  as  to  integrity,  moral  character  and  reputation,  business  probity,  financial  ability  and  experience,  responsibility,  and  other  criteriadeemed
 appropriate by the Michigan Board. A casino license is valid for a period of one year and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon a determinationthat the licensee no long
er meets the requirements for licensure. 
The
 Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or restrict the licensed subsidiary’s casino license. The licensed subsidiary is also subject tofines
 or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming or liquor control laws or rules. In the event that the licensed subsidiary’s license is revoked or suspended formore
 than 120 days, the Michigan Act provides for the appointment of a conservator who, among other things, is required to preserve the assets to ensure that theyshall
 continue to be operated in a sound and businesslike manner, or upon order of the Michigan Board, to sell or otherwise transfer the assets to another person orentity who meets the requi
rements of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject to certain approvals and consultations. 
The
 Michigan Board has adopted administrative rules to implement the terms of the Michigan Act. Among other things, the rules impose more detailedsubstantive and procedural 
requirements with respect to casino licensing and operations. 
Included
 are requirements regarding such things as licensing investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the MichiganBoard, internal control
 and accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownershipinterests in licensed 
casinos. The rules also establish numerous 
5

 Michigan
 Board  procedures  regarding  licensing,  disciplinary  and  other  hearings,  and  similar  matters.  The  rules  have  the  force  of  law  and  are  binding  on  theMichigan Board as well as on appli
cants for or holders of casino licenses. 
Under
 rules of the Michigan Board, a person or company which intends to acquire shares representing more than a 5% equity interest in a publicly tradedcompany
 which  is  the  holding  company  of  a  Michigan  casino  licensee  must  obtain  approval  of  the  acquisition  from  the  Michigan  Board.  Subsequent  to  theacquisition,
 the person or company acquiring the shares must be determined by the Michigan Board to be “suitable” and “qualified” to own the shares. In addition,if
 the acquisition is by a company, “key persons” in the company (generally the officers, directors, managerial employees, and significant owners) must also bedetermined
 to  be  “suitable”  and  “qualified.”  “Institutional  investors”  (as  that  term  is  defined  in  the  Michigan  Act)  may  generally  obtain  a  waiver  from  theserequirements
 if the institutional investor has less than 15% ownership interest in the publicly traded company. Upon attaining equity ownership of 5% or more, orfiling
 Schedule 13D or 13G with the SEC, the Michigan Board must be notified by the investor. Unless otherwise ordered by the Michigan Board, institutionalinvestors acquiring less
 than 10% equity ownership in the publicly traded company are entitled to an exemption from the approval requirements, but are required tofile
 an institutional waiver application with the Michigan Board. Institutional investors acquiring 10% or more equity ownership must apply for an institutionalwaiver,
 supplying certain information delineated in Rule 504(3). Pursuant to Rule 504(4), institutional investors acquiring more than 15% equity ownership mustapply
 to  the  Michigan  Board  for  approval  of  the  acquisition  within  45  days  after  it  occurs.  The  institutional  investor  and  its  key  persons  may  be  subject  tosuitability and qualification
 determinations. 
The
 term “institutional investor” includes financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, etc. The shares held by the institutionalinvestor
 must be held for investment purposes only. The following activities are deemed consistent with holding the shares for investment purposes: voting byproxy
 furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted on by the holders of the voting securities;  serving as a member of a committee  of creditors orsecurity
 holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring; nominating a candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with adebt restructuring; accepting
 appointment or election as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring and serving in that capacity untilthe
 conclusion  of  the  member’s  term;  making  financial  and  other  inquiries  of  management  of  the  type  normally  made  by  securities  analysts  for  informationpurposes
 and not to cause a change in its management, policies, or operations; and other activities that the board determines to be consistent with the investmentintent.
 
The
 Michigan  Liquor  Control  Commission  licenses,  controls  and  regulates  the  sale  of  alcoholic  beverages  by  the  licensed  subsidiary  pursuant  to  theMichigan
 Liquor Control Code of 1998. The Michigan Act also requires that the licensed subsidiary sell in a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor ControlCode.
 
The Detroit
 City Council enacted an ordinance entitled “Casino Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification and Compliance.”The
 ordinance authorizes casino gaming only by operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and are parties to a development agreement which has beenapproved and certified
 by the City Council and is currently in effect, or are acting on behalf of such parties. The development agreement among the City of Detroit,MGM
 Grand Detroit, LLC and the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently in effect. Underthe
 ordinance, the licensed subsidiary is required to submit to the Mayor of Detroit and to the City Council periodic reports regarding its compliance with thedevelopment agreement
 or, in the event of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply. The ordinance requires the Mayorof
 Detroit to monitor each casino operator’s compliance with its development agreement, to take appropriate enforcement action in the event of default and tonotify
 the City Council of defaults and enforcement action taken; and, if a development agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice ofsuch action to the Michigan
 Board within five business days along with Detroit’s request that the Michigan Board revoke the relevant operator’s casino license. If adevelopment agreemen
t is terminated, the Michigan Act requires the Michigan Board to revoke the relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of Detroit. 
The
 administrative rules of the Michigan Board prohibit the licensed subsidiary or us from entering into a debt transaction affecting the capitalization orfinancial viabili
ty of MGM Grand Detroit without prior approval from the Michigan Board. 
The
 Michigan Act effectively provides for a wagering tax equal to 19% of adjusted gross receipts from gaming operations conducted at a casino. Proceedsof
 the wagering tax are shared between the State of Michigan and the City of Detroit. In addition to the wagering tax, the Michigan Act establishes an annualmunicipal
 service fee equal to the greater of $4 million or 1.25% of adjusted gross receipts to be paid to Detroit to defray its cost of hosting casinos, and an annualassessment,
 as  adjusted  annually  based  upon  a  consumer  price  index,  in  the  initial  amount  of  approximately  $8.3  million  to  be  paid  to  Michigan  to  defray  itsregulatory
 enforcement  and other casino-related  costs. These payments are  in addition to the taxes, fees and assessments  customarily  paid by business entitiessituated in Detroit. The l
icensed subsidiary is also obligated to pay 1% of its adjusted gross receipts to Detroit, to be increased to 2% of its adjusted gross receipts inany calendar year in which 
adjusted gross receipts exceed $400 million.

 Mississippi
Government
Regulation
 
We
 conduct  our  Mississippi  gaming  operations  through  two  indirect  subsidiaries,  Beau  Rivage  Resorts,  LLC  which  operates  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,Mississippi,
 and MGM Resorts Mississippi, LLC, which operates the Gold Strike Casino in Tunica County, Mississippi (collectively, the “casino licensees”). Theoperation
 of casino facilities in Mississippi is subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the MississippiGaming Commission and the Mississippi Dep
artment of Revenue. 
The
 Mississippi  Gaming  Control  Act  (the  “Mississippi  Act”)  legalized  casino  gaming  in  Mississippi.  The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  adoptedregulations in further
ance of the Mississippi Act. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to: 
 
• prevent unsavory or unsuitable p ersons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 
 
• establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures; 
 
• maintain  effective  control  over  the  financial  practices  of  licensees,  including  establishing  minimum  procedures  for  internal  fiscal  affairs  andsafeguarding of assets and r
evenues, providing reliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission; 
 
• prevent cheating and fr audulent practices; 
 
• provide a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and 
 
• ensure that gaming lic ensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. 
The
 regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Changes in Mississippi law or the regulations or theMississippi
 Gaming Commission’s interpretations thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted, and could have amaterial adverse 
effect on us and our Mississippi gaming operations. 
The
 Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming at the discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only ifthe
 voters in such counties have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county. As of December 31, 2017, gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible countiesin the
 state and gaming operations had commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties. Prior to Hurricane Katrina,Mississippi
 law required that gaming vessels be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in thewaters of the
 State of Mississippi lying south of the state in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, changes to the lawbecame
 effective which allowed gaming facilities to be constructed on land in the three Gulf Coast counties, provided that no portion of the gaming facilities islocated
 more than 800 feet from the mean high water line of the Mississippi Sound or designated bays on the Sound. The 800-foot limit does not apply to non-gaming
 facilities. The law permits unlimited stakes gaming on permanently moored dockside vessels or in land-based facilities on a 24-hour basis and does notrestrict the perc
entage of space which may be utilized for gaming. There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi. 
The
 casino  licensees  are  subject  to  the  licensing  and  regulatory  control  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.  Gaming  licenses  require  the  periodicpayment of fees and taxes and
 are not transferable. Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter. Thecurrent
 license of Beau Rivage Resorts, LLC is effective through April 20, 2019 and the current license of MGM Resorts Mississippi, LLC. is effective throughJune 22, 2018.
 
We
 are registered by the Mississippi Gaming Commission under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company of the casino licensees. As aregistered
 publicly  traded  corporation,  we  are  subject  to  the  licensing  and  regulatory  control  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission,  and  are  required  toperiodically
 submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and furnish any other information which the MississippiGaming
 Commission may require. If we are unable to satisfy the registration  requirements  of the Mississippi Act, we and our casino licensees cannot own oroperate
 gaming  facilities  in  Mississippi.  The  casino  licensees  are  also  required  to  periodically  submit  detailed  financial,  operating  and  other  reports  to  theMississippi
 Gaming Commission and the Mississippi Department of Revenue and to furnish any other information required thereby. With certain exceptions, noperson
 may  become  a  stockholder  of  or  receive  any  percentage  of  profits  from  the  casino  licensees  without  first  obtaining  licenses  and  approvals  from  theMississippi Gaming Commission.

 Certain
 of our officers, directors and employees must be found suitable or be licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We believe that we haveapplied for all necess
ary findings of suitability with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additionalpersons
 to file applications for findings of suitability. In addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required to be foundsuitable,
 in which case those persons must pay the costs and fees associated with the investigation. A finding of suitability requires submission of detailed personaland
 financial information followed by a thorough investigation. There can be no assurance that a person who is subject to a finding of suitability will be foundsuitable
 by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for any cause that itdeems reasonable. Findings of sui
tability must be periodically renewed. 
Changes
 in certain licensed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission. In addition to its authority to deny an application for afinding
 of suitability, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a licensed position. The Mississippi Gaming Commission hasthe
 power to require us to suspend or dismiss officers, directors and other key employees or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriateapplications or whom
 the authorities find unsuitable to act in their capacities. 
Employees
 associated with gaming must obtain work permits that are subject to immediate suspension. The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse toissue
 a work permit to a person convicted of a felony and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a gaming employee if the employee has committed variousmisdemeanors or knowingly viola
ted the Mississippi Act or for any other reasonable cause. 
At
 any  time,  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  the  power  to  investigate  and  require  a  finding  of  suitability  of  any  of  our  record  or  beneficialstockholders,
 regardless of the percentage of ownership. Mississippi law requires any person who acquires more than 5% of our voting securities to report theacquisition
 to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and that person may be required to be found suitable. Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner ofmore
 than 10% of our voting securities, as reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, must apply for a finding of suitability by the Mississippi GamingCommission. An applicant for find
ing of suitability must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the investigation. 
The
 Mississippi Gaming Commission has generally exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of aregistered
 public or private company’s voting securities. However, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has adopted a regulation that permits certain institutionalinvestors
 to own beneficially up to 25% and, under certain circumstances, up to 29%, of a registered or licensed company’s voting securities without a finding ofsuitability.
 Under the regulations, an “institutional investor,” as defined therein, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission for awaiver
 of a finding of suitability if such institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 25% (or, in certain circumstances, up to 29%) of the voting securities of aregistered
 or  licensed  company,  and (ii)  holds the  voting securities  for investment  purposes only.  An institutional  investor  shall  not be  deemed  to  hold votingsecurities
 for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not forthe
 purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered or licensed company, any changein
 the registered or licensed company’s corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered public or private company or any of itsgaming
 affiliates, or any other action which the Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered or licensed company’s votingsecurities for invest
ment purposes only. 
Activities that are no
t deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: 
 
• voting,  directly or indirectly through the delivery of a proxy furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted upon by the holders of suchvoting securities;
 
 
• serving as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring; 
 
• nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring; 
 
• accepting appointment or  election (or having a representative accept appointment or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection witha debt restructuring and s
erving in that capacity until the conclusion of the member’s term; 
 
• making  financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause achange in management, pol
icies or operations; and 
 
• such other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 
 
8

 If
 a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a listof beneficial owners. The Mississippi Gamin
g Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registeredpublic company’s equity int
erests for any cause it deems reasonable. 
We
 may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any of our debt or other securities. Inaddition, under the Mississippi Ac
t, the Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require holders of our debt securities to file applications, investigatethe holders, and require th
e holders to be found suitable to own the debt securities. 
Although
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and foundsuitable,
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission retains the discretion to do so for any reason, including but not limited to a default, or where the holder of the debtinstrument
 exercises a material influence over the gaming operations of the entity in question. Any holder of debt securities required to apply for a finding ofsuitability must pay al
l investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the investigation. 
Any
 person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi GamingCommission
 may be found unsuitable. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our securities beyond thetime
 that the Mississippi Gaming Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor. After receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, aholder of our debt securit
ies or to have any other relationship with us, we will be subject to disciplinary action if we: 
 
• pay the unsuitable person any div idend, interest or other distribution whatsoever; 
 
• recognize the exerc ise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred through such securities held by the unsuitable person; 
 
• pay the unsuitable person any r emuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in limited and specific circumstances; 
 
• make any payment to the unsui table person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction; or 
 
• fail  to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself or herself of the securities, including, if necessary, the immediatepurchase of the securities
 for cash at a fair market value. 
The
 casino  licensees  must  maintain  in  Mississippi  a  current  ledger  with  respect  to  the  ownership  of  their  equity  securities  and  we  must  maintain  inMississippi a
 current list of our stockholders which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by us. The ledger andstockholder
 lists must be available for inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time. If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by anominee,
 the  record  holder  may  be  required  to  disclose  the  identity  of  the  beneficial  owner  to  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.  A  failure  to  make  thatdisclosure may be grounds for f
inding the record holder unsuitable. We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. 
The Mississippi 
Act requires that the certificates representing securities of a registered publicly traded corporation bear a legend to the general effect that thesecurities
 are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. On May 28, 2009, the Mississippi Gaming Commissiongranted
 us a waiver of this legend requirement. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of oursecurities at any time.
 
Substantially
 all  loans,  leases,  sales  of  securities  and  similar  financing  transactions  by  the  casino  licensees  must  be  reported  to  or  approved  by  theMississippi Gaming Commission. The li
censed subsidiaries may not make a public offering of their securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities with theprior
 approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We may not make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi GamingCommission
 if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or toretire
 or extend obligations incurred for those purposes. The approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or adequacy ofthe
 prospectus or the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. Effective June 23, 2015, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a waiverof
 the prior approval requirement for our securities offerings for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions. The waiver may be rescinded for good causewithout prior notice upon the issu
ance of an interlocutory stop order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. 
 
9

 Under
 the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the casino licensees may not guarantee a security issued by us pursuant to a public offering,or
 pledge their assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by such a security issued by us, without the prior approval of the MississippiGaming
 Commission. Similarly, we may not pledge the stock or other ownership interests of the casino licensees, nor may the pledgee of such ownership interestsforeclose on such a pledge, without the prior approval of the Mississi
ppi Gaming Commission. Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued byus
 and agreements not to encumber such securities granted by us are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The waiver ofthe prior approval requirement for our securities offerings received from the Mississippi Gamin
g Commission effective June 23, 2015 includes a waiver of the priorapproval requirement 
for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions of the casino licensees, subject to certain conditions. 
We
 cannot change our control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover withoutthe
 prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, andother
 persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approvalprocess relating to the 
transaction. 
The
 Mississippi Legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporatedefensive tactics th
at affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may beinjurious to stable and produc
tive corporate gaming. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverseeffects
 of  these  business  practices  upon  Mississippi’s  gaming  industry  and  to  further  Mississippi’s  policy  to  assure  the  financial  stability  of  corporate  gamingoperators
 and  their  affiliates,  preserve  the  beneficial  aspects  of  conducting  business  in  the  corporate  form,  and  promote  a  neutral  environment  for  the  orderlygovernance of corporate 
affairs. 
We
 may be required to obtain approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities inexcess
 of  the  current  market  price  of  its  common  stock  (commonly  called  “greenmail”)  or  before  we  may  consummate  a  corporate  acquisition  opposed  bymanagement.
 The regulations also require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission if we adopt a plan of recapitalization proposed by our Board ofDirectors opposing a tender of
fer made directly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of us. 
Neither
 we  nor  the  casino  licensees  may  engage  in  gaming  activities  in  Mississippi  while  we,  the  casino  licensees  and/or  persons  found  suitable  to  beassociated
 with  the  gaming  license  of  the  casino  licensees  conduct  gaming  operations  outside  of  Mississippi  without  approval  of  the  Mississippi  GamingCommission.
 The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  may  require  that  it  have  access  to  information  concerning  our,  and  our  affiliates’,  out-of-state  gamingoperations. We
 believe that we have applied for all necessary waivers of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission for the conduct of ouractive or planned gaming op
erations outside of Mississippi. 
If
 the Mississippi Gaming Commission decides that the casino licensees violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission couldlimit,
 condition, suspend or revoke the license of the subsidiary. In addition, we, the casino licensees and the persons involved could be subject to substantial finesfor
 each separate violation. A violation under any of our other operating subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of the casino licensees’ gaminglicense.
 
Because
 of a violation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities. Limitation, conditioningor
 suspension of the casino licensees’ gaming license or our registration as a publicly traded holding company, or the appointment of a supervisor could, and therevocation of any gaming l
icense or registration would, materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations. 
The casino licensees must p
ay license fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and tothe county
 or city in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payableeither
 monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues, the number of slot machines operated by the casino, and thenumber of table games ope
rated by the casino. 
The
 license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon “gross revenues,” generally defined as cash receipts less cash payouts to customers aswinnings,
 and generally equals 8% of gross revenue. These license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid. Thegross revenue
 fee imposed by the Mississippi cities and counties in which casino operations are located is in addition to the fees payable to the State of Mississippiand equals approximately 4
% of gross revenue. 
The
 Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation in 1994 requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’splan include a 500-car 
parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities 
10

 which
 will amount to at least 25% of the casino cost. Infrastructure facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at least 250 rooms, theme park,golf course and
 other similar facilities. Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in compliance with this requirement. On January 21, 1999, the Mississippi GamingCommission
 adopted an amendment to this regulation which increased the infrastructure  requirement  to 100% from the existing 25%; however, the regulationgrandfathers existing licensees and applies only to new casino
 projects and casinos that are not operating at the time of acquisition or purchase, and would thereforenot
 apply to Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica. In any event, Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica would comply with such requirement. On February 21, 2013,the
 Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  adopted  further  amendments  to  this  regulation  to  impose  additional  requirements  on  new  casino  projects.  However,  theamended
 regulation  grandfathers  any  licensee  who  has  been  licensed  by  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  prior  to  December  31,  2013;  therefore,  theamendments do not apply to Beau Rivag
e or Gold Strike Tunica. 
Both
 the local jurisdiction and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Mississippi Department of Revenue license, control and regulate the sale ofalcoholic
 beverages by the casino licensees. Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in areas designated as special resort areas, which allows casinos locatedtherein
 to  serve  alcoholic  beverages  on  a  24-hour  basis.  The  Alcoholic  Beverage  Control  Division  requires  that  our  key  officers  and  managers  and  the  casinolicensees’
 key officers and managers and all owners of more than 5% of the casino licensees’ equity submit detailed personal, and in some instances, financialinformation
 to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and be investigated and licensed. All such licenses are non-transferable. The Alcohol Beverage ControlDivision
 has the full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with orwithout conditions. Any disciplinary 
action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the casino’s operations.
Illinois
Government
Regulation
 
Our
 50% joint venture ownership interest  in Grand Victoria  Riverboat Casino, located  in Elgin, Illinois  (“Grand  Victoria”)  is subject to extensive  stateregulation under the Il
linois Riverboat Gambling Act (the “Illinois Act”) and the regulations of the Illinois Gaming Board (the “Illinois Board”). 
In
 February  1990,  the  State  of  Illinois  legalized  riverboat  gambling.  The  Illinois  Act  authorizes  the  Illinois  Board  to  issue  up  to  ten  riverboat  gamingowners’
 licenses on any water within the State of Illinois or any water other than Lake Michigan which constitutes a boundary of the State of Illinois. The IllinoisAct
 restricts the location of certain of the ten owners’ licenses. Three of the licenses must be located on the Mississippi River. One license must be at a location onthe
 Illinois River south of Marshall County and another license must be located on the Des Plaines River in Will County. The remaining licenses are not restrictedas
 to location. Currently, all ten owner’s licenses are in operation in Alton, Aurora, East Peoria, East St. Louis, Elgin, Metropolis, Rock Island, Des Plaines, andtwo licenses in Joliet.
 
The
 Illinois Act strictly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations. It grants the Illinois Board specific powersand duties,
 and all other powers necessary and proper to fully and effectively execute the Illinois Act for the purpose of administering, regulating and enforcing thesystem
 of  riverboat  gaming.  The  Illinois  Board  has  authority  over  every  person,  association,  corporation,  partnership  and  trust  involved  in  riverboat  gamingoperations in the State of 
Illinois. 
The Illinois Act requires the owner of a riverboat gaming operation to hold an ow
ner’s license issued by the Illinois Board. Each owner’s license permits theholder
 to own up to two riverboats as part of its gaming operation; however, gaming participants are limited to 1,200 for any owner’s license. The number ofgaming participants wil
l be determined by the number of gaming positions available at any given time. Gaming positions are counted as follows: 
 
• positions for electroni c gaming devices will be determined as 90% of the total number of devices available for play; 
 
• craps tables will be count ed as having ten gaming positions; and 
 
• games utilizing live g aming devices, except for craps, will be counted as having five gaming positions. 
Each
 owner’s license initially runs for a period of three years. Thereafter, the license must be renewed annually. The Board may renew an owner’s licensefor
 up to four years.  An owner licensee  is eligible  for renewal  upon payment of the applicable  fee  and a determination  by the Illinois  Board that  the licenseecontinues
 to meet all of the requirements of the Illinois Act and Illinois Board’s rules. The owner’s license for Grand Victoria was issued in October 1994 and wasrenewed
 for a four-year period that ends in October 2020. An ownership interest in an owner’s license may not be transferred or pledged as collateral without theprior approval of the Il
linois Board. 
 
11

 Pursuant to the
 Illinois Act, the Illinois Board established certain rules to follow in deciding whether to approve direct or indirect ownership or control of anowner’s license.
 The Illinois Board must consider the impact of any economic concentration caused by the ownership or control. No direct or indirect ownership orcontrol
 may  be  approved  which  will  result  in  undue  economic  concentration  of  the  ownership  of  a  riverboat  gambling  operation  in  Illinois.  The  Illinois  Actspecifies
 a number of criteria for the Illinois Board to consider in determining whether the approval of the issuance, transfer or holding of a license will createundue
 economic concentration. The application of such criteria could reduce the number of potential purchasers for the Grand Victoria or our 50% joint ventureinterest therein.
 
The
 Illinois Act does not limit the maximum bet or per patron loss. Minimum and maximum wagers on games are set by the holder of the owner’s license.Wagering
 may not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager and wagers only may be receivedfrom a person present on the 
riverboat. With respect to electronic gaming devices, the payout percentage may not be less than 80% or more than 100%. 
Illinois
 imposes a number of taxes on Illinois casinos. Such taxes are subject to change by the Illinois legislature and have been increased in the past. TheIllinois
 legislature also may impose new taxes on Grand Victoria’s activities. Illinois currently imposes an admission tax of $2.00 per person for an owner licenseethat admitted 1,000,000 persons or 
fewer in the 2004 calendar year, and $3.00 per person for all other owner licensees (including Grand Victoria). 
Additionally,
 Illinois imposes a wagering tax on the adjusted gross receipts, as defined in the Illinois Act, of a riverboat operation. The owner licensee isrequired, on a daily basis, to wi
re the wagering tax payment to the Illinois Board. Currently, the wagering tax is: 
 
• 15.0% of adjusted gross receip ts up to and including $25.0 million; 
 
• 22.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $25.0 million but not exceeding $50.0 million; 
 
• 27.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $50.0 million but not exceeding $75.0 million; 
 
• 32.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $75.0 million but not exceeding $100.0 million; 
 
• 37.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $100.0 million but not exceeding $150.0 million; 
 
• 45.0% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $150.0 million but not exceeding $200.0 million; and 
 
• 50.0% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $200.0 million. 
A
 holder of any gaming license in Illinois is subject to imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of such license, or other action for any act or failure toact
 by the licensee or the licensee’s agents or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of theState
 of Illinois, or that would discredit or tend to discredit the Illinois gaming industry or the State of Illinois. The Illinois Board may revoke or suspend licenses,as
 the Illinois Board may determine and, in compliance with applicable Illinois law regarding administrative procedures, may suspend an owner’s license, withoutnotice
 or hearing, upon a determination that the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by continuing a riverboat’s operation. The suspension mayremain
 in effect until the Illinois Board determines that the cause for suspension has been abated and it may revoke the owner’s license upon a determination thatthe owner has not made satisf
actory progress toward abating the hazard. 
If
 the  Illinois  Board  has  suspended,  revoked  or  refused  to  renew  an  owner’s  license  or  if  a  riverboat  gambling  operation  is  closing  and  the  owner  isvoluntarily
 surrendering its owner’s license, the Illinois Board may petition the local circuit court in which the riverboat is situated for appointment of a receiver.The circuit court has sol
e jurisdiction over any and all issues pertaining to the appointment of a receiver. The Illinois Board specifies the specific powers, duties andlimitations of the receiver.
 
The
 Illinois Board requires that each “Key Person” of an owner licensee submit a Personal Disclosure or Business Entity Form and be investigated andapproved
 by the Illinois Board. The Illinois Board determines which positions, individuals or Business Entities are required to be approved by the Board as KeyPersons. Once approved, such Key Person status must b
e maintained. Key Persons include: 
 
• any  Business Entity and any individual with an ownership interest or voting rights of more than 5% in the licensee or applicant and the trustee of anytrust holding such ownership inter
est or voting rights; 
 
12

  
• the directors of the licensee  or applicant and its chief executive officer, president and chief operating officer or their functional equivalents; 
 
• a Gaming Operations  Manager or any other business entity or individual who has influence and/or control over the conduct of gaming or the RiverboatGaming Operation; and
 
 
• all  other individuals or Business Entities that, upon review of the applicant’s or licensees Table of Organization, Ownership and Control the Boarddetermines
 hold a position or a level of ownership, control or influence that is material to the regulatory concerns and obligations of the Illinois Boardfor the specified li
censee or applicant. 
Each
 owner licensee must provide a means for the economic disassociation of a Key Person in the event such economic disassociation is required by anorder
 of  the  Illinois  Board.  Based  upon  findings  from  an  investigation  into  the  character,  reputation,  experience,  associations,  business  probity  and  financialintegrity of a Key Person, the I
llinois Board may enter an order upon the licensee or require the economic disassociation of the Key Person. 
Applicants
 for and holders of an owner’s license are required to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval for changes in the following: (i) Key Persons; (ii) typeof
 entity;  (iii)  equity and debt capitalization  of the entity;  (iv) investors and/or debt holders; (v) source of funds; (vi) applicant’s  economic  development  plan;(vii)
 riverboat capacity or significant design change; (viii) gaming positions; (ix) anticipated economic impact; or (x) agreements, oral or written, relating to theacquisition or
 disposition of property (real or personal) of a value greater than $1 million. Illinois regulations provide that a holder of an owner’s license may makedistributions to its stockhold
ers only to the extent that such distributions do not impair the financial viability of the owner. 
The
 Illinois  Board  requires  each  holder  of  an  owner’s  license  to  obtain  the  Illinois  Board’s  approval  prior  to  issuing  a  guaranty  of  any  indebtedness.Accordingly,
 we and our  subsidiaries with a direct interest in Grand Victoria intend  to petition the Illinois Board to allow those  subsidiaries to  issue subsidiary guaranties 
of  any indebtedness that we incur in the future to the extent such guaranties are required  by our lenders. Although we and those subsidiaries believe the Illinois
 Board will continue to approve our petitions and allow such  guaranties of our future indebtedness, there can be no assurance that the Illinois Board willcontinue to grant the nec
essary approvals. 
The
 Illinois Board requires that each “institutional investor,” as that term is defined by Illinois Board, that, individually or jointly with others, cumulativelyacquires,
 directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall,within no
 less than ten days after acquiring such securities, notify the Illinois Board of such ownership and shall, upon request, provide such additional informationas
 may be required by the Illinois Board. An institutional investor that, individually or jointly with others, cumulatively acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% ormore
 of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall file an “Institutional Investor DisclosureForm,”
 provided by the Illinois Board, within 45 days after cumulatively acquiring such level of ownership interest, unless such requirement is waived by theIllinois
 Board. Additionally, we must notify the Illinois Board as soon as possible after we become aware that we are involved in an ownership acquisition by aninstitutional investor.
 
The
 Illinois Board may waive any licensing requirement or procedure provided by rule if it determines that the waiver is in the best interests of the publicand the gaming industry. Also, the I
llinois Board may, from time to time, amend or change its rules. 
On
 January 1, 2008, Illinois’ statewide public smoking ban became effective. Smoking is now illegal in Illinois’ casinos, bars, restaurants and other publicestablishments. This may con
tinue to negatively impact the gaming industry in Illinois. 
From time
 to time, various proposals have been introduced in the Illinois legislature that, if enacted, would affect the taxation, regulation, operation or otheraspects of
 the gaming industry. The Illinois legislature regularly considers proposals that would expand gaming opportunities in Illinois. Some of this legislation, ifenacted, could adversely 
affect the gaming industry. No assurance can be given whether such or similar legislation will be enacted. 
The
 Illinois  legislature  continues  to  discuss  the  possibility  of  gaming  expansion.  This  expansion  could  include  several  new  casinos  (including  one  inChicago), increased gaming
 positions in existing casinos, as well as gaming positions at Illinois racetracks. If gaming expansion occurs, Grand Victoria’s operatingresults could be adversely 
impacted by the increased competition.

 On
 July 13, 2009, Illinois enacted the Video Gaming Act, which legalizes the use of up to five video gaming terminals in most bars, restaurants, fraternalorganizations
 and veterans’ organizations holding valid Illinois liquor licenses, as well as at qualifying truck stops. The Illinois Board adopted a set of Regulationsand
 continues to release new or emergency Regulations, as necessary, to implement and regulate the Video Gaming Act. Effective October 9, 2012, video gamingin
 Illinois became operational. The video gaming terminals in licensed establishments allow patrons to play games such as video poker, line up and blackjack. In December
 201 7 , over 6,2 00  licensed  establishments  were  operating  nearly 2 8 ,000 video  gaming  terminals.  Grand  Victoria’s  revenues  may  be  adverselyimpacted by the availability 
of video gaming terminals in non-casino establishments proximately located to its customer base.

Laws
and
Regulations
 
MGM
 Grand Paradise is regulated  as a gaming operator  under applicable  Macau law and our ownership interest  in MGM Grand Paradise is subject tocontinuing regulatory
 scrutiny. We are required to be approved by the Macau government (gaming authorities) to own an interest in a gaming operator. Authorizedgaming
 operators must pay periodic fees and taxes, and gaming rights are not transferable, unless approved by the Macau government. MGM Grand Paradise mustperiodically
 submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Macau gaming authorities and furnish any other information that the Macau gaming authoritiesmay
 require.  No  person  may  acquire  any  rights  over  the  shares  or  assets  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  without  first  obtaining  the  approval  of  the  Macau  gamingauthorities.
 The transfer or creation of encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of MGM Grand Paradise or other rights relating tosuch
 shares, and any act involving the granting of voting rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons or entities other than the original owners, would require theapproval
 of the Macau government and the subsequent report of such acts and transactions to the Macau gaming authorities. The stock of MGM Grand Paradiseand its casinos, assets and equip
ment shall not be subject to any liens or encumbrances, except under authorization by the Macau government. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract requires approval of the Macau government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in anyof
 the direct or indirect stockholders in MGM Grand Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amountthat
 is equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM Grand Paradise. Under the subconcession contract, this approval requirement does not apply tosecurities
 that  are  listed  and  tradable  on  a  stock  market.  Since  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  securities  are  not  listed  and  tradable  on  a  stock  market  this  approvalrequirement
 applies to transfers of MGM Grand Paradise’s shares. In addition, this contract requires that the Macau government be given notice of the creation ofany
 encumbrance or the grant of voting rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons other than the original owners on shares in any of the direct or indirectstockholders
 in MGM Grand Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% ofthe share capital in MGM Grand Pa
radise. This notice requirement will not apply, however, to securities listed and tradable on a stock exchange. 
MGM Grand
 Paradise is in no case allowed to delegate the management of gaming operations to a management company, and is in no case allowed to enterinto
 a management contract by which its managing powers are or might be assumed by a third party. Any act or contract by which MGM Grand Paradise assigns,transfers,
 alienates or creates liens or encumbrances on gaming operations to or in favor of a third party is prohibited, unless previously approved by the Macaugovernment.
 
The
 Macau gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, MGM Grand Paradise todetermine
 whether MGM Grand Paradise’s suitability and/or financial capacity is affected by that individual. MGM Grand Paradise shareholders with 5% or moreof
 the share capital and directors must apply for and undergo a finding of suitability process and maintain due qualification during the subconcession term, andaccept
 the persistent and long-term inspection and supervision exercised by the Macau government. MGM Grand Paradise is required to immediately notify theMacau
 government should MGM Grand Paradise become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5%or
 more of the share capital, or any director or key employee. Changes in approved corporate positions must be reported to the Macau gaming authorities. TheMacau gaming authoriti
es have jurisdiction to deny an application for a finding of suitability. 
Any
 person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability after being ordered to do so by the Macau gaming authorities may be found unsuitable.Any
 stockholder subject to a suitability process who is found unsuitable must transfer their shares to a third party within a term set by the Macau government. Ifsuch
 transfer is not consummated, MGM Grand Paradise must acquire those shares. If any officer, director or key employee is found unsuitable, MGM GrandParadise must
 sever all relationships with that person. In case of failure to act in accordance thereof, MGM Grand Paradise would become subject to administrativesanctions and penalties.
 
The
 Macau  government  must  give  their  prior  approval  to  changes  in  control  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  through  a  merger,  consolidation,  stock  or  assetacquisition,
 management or consulting agreement or any act or conduct by any person whereby he or she obtains control. Entities seeking to acquire control of aregistered corporat
ion must satisfy the Macau government concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. The Macau gaming authorities mayalso require controll
ing stockholders, officers, 
14

 directors
 and other  persons having a material  relationship  or involvement  with the entity  proposing to acquire  control, to be considered  suitable  as part of theapproval process of the tr
ansaction. 
The Macau gaming authorities also
 have the power to supervise gaming operators in order to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators andtheir affiliates.
 
The
 subconcession contract requires the Macau gaming authorities’ prior approval of any recapitalization plan, any increase of the capital stock by publicsubscription,
 any issue of preferential shares or any creation, issue or transformation of types or series of shares representative of MGM Grand Paradise capitalstock,
 as well as any change in the constituent documents (i.e., articles of association) of MGM Grand Paradise. The Chief Executive of Macau could also requireMGM Grand Paradise to increase i
ts share capital if he deemed it necessary. 
MGM
 Macau was constructed and is operated under MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract. This subconcession excludes the following gamingactivities:
 mutual bets, gaming activities provided to the public, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gambling activities on ships orplanes. MGM
 Grand Paradise’s subconcession is exclusively governed by Macau law. MGM Grand Paradise is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts ofMacau in case of any potent
ial dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020. Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, all casino operations andrelated
 equipment in MGM Macau will automatically be transferred to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise and MGM ResortsInternational
 will cease to generate any revenues from these operations. Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession bygiving MGM Grand Paradise at least on
e year prior notice and by paying fair compensation or indemnity. 
The amount of such compensation o
r indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption. 
The
 Macau government also has the right to unilaterally terminate, without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, the subconcession at any time upon theoccurrence
 of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  basic  obligations  under  thesubconcession contract. If the default is curable,
 the Macau gaming authorities are required to give MGM Grand Paradise prior notice to cure the default, though nospecific cure period 
for that purpose is provided. 
The
 subconcession contract contains various general covenants and obligations and other provisions, the compliance with which is subjective. MGM GrandParadise has the following oblig
ations under the subconcession contract: 
 
• ensure the proper operat ion and conduct of casino games; 
 
• employ people with appropria te qualifications; 
 
• operate and conduct casino g ames of chance in a fair and honest manner without the influence of criminal activities; and 
 
• safeguard and ensure Macau ’s interests in tax revenue from the operation of casinos and other gaming areas. 
The subconcession contract r
equires MGM Grand Paradise Limited to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance which are in place. 
MGM Grand Paradise Limited is also sub
ject to certain reporting requirements to the Macau gaming authorities. 
Under
 the subconcession, MGM Grand Paradise Limited is obligated to pay to the Macau S.A.R. an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variableportion
 based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated. The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas(approximately
 $3.73  million,  based  on  exchange  rates  at  December  29,  2017).  The  variable  portion  is  equal  to  300,000  patacas  per  gaming  table  reservedexclusively for certain kinds of games
 or players, 150,000 patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine,including
 slot machines (approximately $37,280, $18,640 and $124, respectively, based on exchange rates at December 29, 2017), subject to a minimum of fortyfive
 million patacas (approximately $5.6 million, based on exchange rates at December 29, 2017). MGM Grand Paradise Limited also has to pay a special gamingtax
 of 35% of gross gaming revenues and applicable withholding taxes. It must also contribute 1.6% and 2.4% (a portion of which must be used for promotion oftourism in Macau) of its
 gross gaming revenue to a public foundation designated by the Macau S.A.R. government and to the Macau S.A.R, respectively, as speciallevy.
 
 
15

 Currently,
 the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions forcredit
 losses. As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has topay taxes on its winnings from thes
e customers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise has received a concession from the Macau government to use a 10.67 acre parcel of land for MGM Macau (the “MGM Macau LandContract”). The land concess
ion will expire on April 6, 2031 and is renewable. 
The
 MGM Macau Land Contract requires MGM Grand Paradise to pay a premium which was paid in full before the opening of MGM Macau. In addition,MGM
 Grand Paradise is also obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM Macau Land Contract. The rent amount may be revised every five years bythe Macau government, ac
cording to the provisions of the Macau Land law. 
In
 addition, MGM Grand Paradise has received a concession from the Macau government to use an approximately 18 acre site in Cotai Macau and developa
 second resort and casino (the “Cotai Land Contract”). The  land concession contract became effective on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. Thetotal
 land premium payable to the Macau government for the land concession contract is $161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additionalsemi-annual payments. In J
anuary 2017, MGM China paid the final semi-annual payment of $15 million under the land concession contract. 
MGM
 Grand Paradise received an exemption from Macau’s corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for aperiod
 of five-years starting at January 1, 2007. In October 2011, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of this exemption for an additional five years.The exemption was further ex
tended on September 7, 2016 through March 31, 2020.
Maryland
Government
Regulation
 
The
 Maryland State Lottery Video Lottery Terminal Law (“Maryland VLT Law”) subjects the owners and operators of video lottery facilities to extensivestate
 licensing and regulatory requirements. We are subject to the Maryland VLT Law and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownershipinterest in MGM National Harbor, LLC, which owns and op
erates the MGM National Harbor video lottery facility in Prince George’s County, Maryland. 
Under
 the  Maryland  VLT  Law,  the  Maryland  Lottery  and  Gaming  Control  Commission  (“Maryland  Commission”),  in  conjunction  with  the  MarylandLottery
 and Gaming Control Agency (“Maryland Agency”), maintains authority to regulate the operation of video lottery terminals and tables games within theState
 of Maryland, and to issue video lottery operation licenses to qualified applicants. The Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission (“MarylandLocation
 Commission”)  has  the  authority  to  award  up  to  six  video  lottery  operation  licenses  within  the  State  of  Maryland  and  is  responsible  for  evaluatingcompeting
 proposals  and  awarding  the  video  lottery  operation  licenses  to  applicants  based  on  business  and  market,  economic  development  and  location  sitingfactors.
 The Maryland Location Commission cannot award a video lottery operation license to an applicant until the Maryland Commission determines that theapplicant
 is qualified. On October 10, 2013, the Maryland Commission determined that MGM National Harbor, LLC and all applicable principals were qualified,and
 on  December  23,  2013,  the  Maryland  Location  Commission  awarded  the  video  lottery  operation  license  in  Prince  George’s  County,  Maryland  to  MGMNational
 Harbor,  LLC.  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  was  awarded  the  sixth  and  final  video  lottery  operation  license  in  Maryland.  On  December  7,  2016,  theMaryland Commission issued a video 
lottery operation license to MGM National Harbor, LLC, which license has an initial term of 15 years. 
The initial license 
fee was based on the number of video lottery terminals initially proposed within the video lottery facility. As 3,600 video lottery terminalswere
 proposed for MGM National Harbor, our initial license fee was $21 million, and the Maryland Location Commission determined that MGM National Harbormay
 have up to 3,600 terminals. Within 1 year of the end of the initial 15–year license term, a video lottery operation licensee may reapply for a license that has alicense term of 10 yea
rs and a license fee to be established by statute. 
At the request of the Company, on August 17, 2016, the M
aryland Commission temporarily reduced the number of permitted video lottery terminals to3,321, which temporary reduction was 
to become permanent if there were not 3,600 terminals in operation at MGM National Harbor by December 8, 2017.However, at the request of the Comp
any, on June 29, 2017, the Maryland Commission approved a further temporary reduction to not less than 2,700 terminals inconnection with a casino expans
ion project while preserving the Company’s originally authorized allotment of 3,600 terminals until December 8, 2018. TheMaryland Commission further d
etermined that as of December 8, 2018 the authorized number of terminals shall be not less than 3,321 or more than 3,600, with thefinal authorized numbe
r of terminals being the actual number of terminals in operation at MGM National Harbor as of December 8, 2018. 
16

 Under the
 Maryland VLT Law, video lottery terminals each must have an average payout percentage of at least 87%.Video lottery facilities are permitted tooperate
 24 hours a day, and patrons must be 21 years of age to wager. While alcohol may be offered in the video lottery facility, it may not be offered free ofcharge.
 The Maryland VLT Law and regulations also impose various restrictions  on check cashing, debit and credit  card usage, ATMs, and other transactionswithin the video lottery f
acility. 
The
 Maryland Commission has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for a video lottery operationlicense,
 affiliated holding or intermediary companies, directors, officers, key management employees, principals, partners, and other persons or entities holding afive percent or grea
ter interest in the applicant, are qualified under the Maryland VLT Law. 
The
 Maryland VLT Law provides that institutional  investors may be exempt from certain regulatory requirements,  and an Institutional  Investor WaiverApplication may
 be submitted for entities holding an interest in an applicant or licensee that are considered institutional investors. The term “institutional investor”generally
 includes  insurance  companies,  banks  and  financial  institutions,  investment  companies,  trusts  and  advisors,  pension  funds,  etc.  The  MarylandCommission’s
 decision concerning whether to grant a waiver is discretionary, and based on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the institutionalinvestor’s
 securities, whether the investor is substantially involved in the video lottery operations of the licensee, and the investor’s gaming licensure history inother jurisdictions.
 
After
 a video lottery operation license is awarded and/or issued, the Maryland Commission has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing ofthe
 licensee and its officers, directors, and other designated persons. The Maryland Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or restrict a video lotteryoperation
 license,  and  may  levy  civil  penalties  for  regulatory  and  other  violations.  The  licensee’s  participation  in  video  lottery  and  table  game  operations  isexpressly
 deemed  a  revocable  privilege  under  the  Maryland  VLT  Law,  conditioned  on  the  proper  and  continued  qualification  of  the  licensee  and  the  licenseemeeting
 reporting requirements and continuing to provide any assistance and information necessary to the Maryland regulators. Each licensee has an affirmativeresponsibility to provide
 an annual update of applicable licensing information to the Maryland Commission. Among other things, the Maryland Commission is alsoresponsible
 for the collection of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations into the operation of video lottery terminals and table games, andreviewing and ruling on compla
ints, and may conduct unannounced inspections of the video lottery facility premises or the licensee’s records and equipment. 
The
 regulations  promulgated  to  implement  the  Maryland  VLT  Law  impose  detailed  substantive  and  procedural  requirements  related  to  video  lotterylicensing
 and ongoing operations. The regulations include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning: licensing investigations and hearings; marketing controlsand
 standards; internal control standards related to accounting, finance and statistics, audits, record retention, complimentaries,  surveillance, security, cage andcustomer transactions, p
romotions, and other gaming related controls; facility design standards; table games surveillance; gaming floor plans; the transportation andtesting of video lottery terminals and table games equipment; the registration of video lottery terminals and table games; voluntary and mandatory patron exclu
sion;responsible
 gaming; and junket enterprises and representatives. Applicants and licensees must also meet requirements concerning minority business participation,provide health insurance
 and retirement benefits for employees, and give preference to hiring employees located within ten miles of the video lottery facility. 
Generally,
 a video lottery operation license may not be transferred, assigned or pledged as collateral without approval from the Maryland Commission.Specifically,
 a licensee cannot sell or transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interests in the licensee unless the Maryland Commission is notified anddetermines that the buyer or transferee meets all applicable qualification and regulatory requirements. If the licensee fails to meet these requirements, the applicable
license
 will be automatically revoked ninety days after the transfer or sale. Entities and individuals are also prohibited from owning an interest in more than onevideo
 lottery facility, and any application to the Maryland Location Commission to apply for an additional license must include a plan for divesting the applicableinterest
 in the initial license. Applicants seeking investors in an entity applying for a video lottery operation license must make serious, good-faith efforts to solicitand
 interview a reasonable number of minority investors before a license will be awarded by the Maryland Location Commission, and following the award, mustagain
 make serious, good-faith efforts to interview minority investors in any future attempts to raise venture capital or attract new investors to the entity awardedthe license.
 
The
 Maryland  Commission  retains  the  authority  to  recommend  or  propose  changes  to  the  Maryland  VLT  Law,  and  may  amend  or  change  regulationsconcerning the Maryland VLT Law, which, i
f enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Maryland.
New
Jersey
Government
Regulation
 
Our
 ownership  of  Borgata  in  Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey  subjects  us  to  extensive  state  regulation  under  the  New  Jersey  Casino  Control  Act  and  theregulations
 promulgated  thereunder  (collectively,  the  “NJ  Act”)  and  various  other  statutes  and  regulations.  The  New  Jersey  Casino  Control  Commission  (“NJCommission”) and the New Jersey Division o
f Gaming Enforcement (“NJ Division” 
17

 and,
 together with the NJ Commission, the “NJ Gaming Authorities”) are, to varying degrees, empowered to regulate a wide spectrum of gaming and non-gamingrelated
 activities and to approve the form of ownership and financial structure of not only a casino licensee, but also its holding and intermediary companies andentity qualifiers.
 
The
 NJ Commission issues casino licenses and casino key employee licenses and the NJ Division issues all other types of licenses, including permits toconduct
 intrastate Internet gaming and registrations and licenses to persons who provide goods or services to a casino. The NJ Division also is responsible forinvestigating all li
cense applications and for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the requirements of the NJ Act. 
On
 June 24, 2010, the NJ Commission renewed Borgata’s casino license effective July 1, 2010 for a term which became indefinite by operation of law.However, no
 later than five years after the issuance of a casino license, and approximately every five years thereafter, the casino licensee and its qualifying entitiesand
 individuals must submit information to the NJ Gaming Authorities to demonstrate their continuing qualification. In addition, the NJ Commission may reopenthe
 license hearing at any time, and the NJ Commission must do so at the request of the NJ Division. In September 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries werefound qualified as holding comp
anies of Borgata. 
Pursuant
 to the NJ Act and applicable precedent, no entity may hold a casino license unless each officer, director, person who directly or indirectly holdsany
 beneficial interest or ownership of the securities of the licensee, each person who in the opinion of the Director of the NJ Division has the ability to control orelect
 a majority of the board of directors of the licensee (other than a banking or other licensed lending institution acting in the ordinary course of business) andeach of its holding, inter
mediary or subsidiary companies, obtains and maintains qualification approval from the NJ Gaming Authorities. 
Persons
 holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding or intermediary company are presumed to have the ability to control the company or electone or more
 of its directors and will, unless this presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or the qualification requirement is waived, be required toindividually qualify. Equity s
ecurities are defined in the NJ Act as any voting stock or any other security having a direct or indirect participation in the profits of theissuer.
 Notwithstanding either the presumption of control for holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding company or the requirement that a casinolicensee
 establish and maintain the qualification of certain holders of debt securities, the NJ Act provides for a waiver of qualification for passive “institutionalinvestors,” as defined by the NJ Act und
er certain circumstances. 
Casino
 licensees  are  also  required  to  establish  and  maintain  the  qualifications  of  any  financial  backer,  investor,  mortgagee,  bondholder,  or  holder  ofindentures,
 notes or other evidences of indebtedness, either in effect or proposed which bears any relation to the casino operation or casino hotel premises whoholds
 25% or more of such financial instruments or other evidences of indebtedness; provided, however, in circumstances of default, persons holding 10% of suchfinancial
 instruments or evidences of indebtedness shall be required to establish and maintain their qualifications. Persons who hold less than these thresholds maybe
 required to establish and maintain their qualifications in the discretion of the Director of the NJ Division. Banks and licensed lending institutions, however, areexempt from any qualif
ication requirements if they are acting in the ordinary course of business. 
The
 NJ  Act  imposes  certain  restrictions  upon  the  issuance,  ownership  and  transfer  of  securities  of  a  casino  licensee  and  its  holding  and  intermediarycompanies
 and defines the term “security”  to include instruments  which evidence  a direct  or indirect  beneficial  ownership or creditor  interest,  including stock(common
 and  preferred)  mortgages,  debentures,  security  agreements,  notes,  warrants,  options  and  rights.  If  the  NJ  Commission  finds  that  a  holder  of  suchsecurities
 is  not  qualified  under  the  NJ  Act,  it  has  the  right  to  take  any  remedial  action  deemed  appropriate  including  the  right  to  force  divestiture  by  suchdisqualified
 holder of such securities. In the event that certain disqualified holders fail to divest themselves of such securities, the NJ Commission has the power torevoke or suspend the casino license or
 licenses related to the company which issued the securities. It is unlawful for a disqualified holder (i) to exercise, directly orthrough
 any trustee or nominee, any right conferred by such securities or (ii) to receive any dividends or interest upon such securities or any remuneration, in anyform, from its affiliated casino
 licensee for services rendered or otherwise. 
The
 NJ Act requires our certificate of incorporation to provide that our securities are held subject to the condition that if a holder is found to be disqualifiedby the NJ
 Commission pursuant to the NJ Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest in the company. Accordingly, our certificate of incorporation provides that aholder of our securities 
must dispose of such securities if the holder is found disqualified under the NJ Act. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides thatwe may redeem the stock of 
any holder found to be disqualified. 
The
 ability  of  a  lender  to  foreclose  on  pledged  assets,  including  gaming  equipment,  is  subject  to  compliance  with  the  NJ  Act.  Generally,  no  person  ispermitted
 to hold an ownership interest in or manage a casino or own any gaming assets, including gaming devices, without being licensed. Consequently, anylender
 who  desires  to  enforce  a  security  interest  must  file  the  necessary  applications  for  licensure,  be  investigated,  and  either  be  found  qualified  by  the  NJCommission or obtain interim
 casino authorization (“ICA”) prior to obtaining any ownership interest. Similarly, any prospective purchaser of an ownership interestin a casino or of
 
18

 gaming
 assets must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain ICA prior to obtainingany ownership interest or gam
ing assets.
Massachusetts
Government
Regulation
 
The
 Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act (“Massachusetts Act”) subjects the owners and operators of gaming establishments to extensive state licensingand regulatory
 requirements. We are subject to the Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownership interest in Blue TarpreDevelopment,
 LLC  (“Blue  Tarp”),  which  is  expected  to  operate  a  gaming  establishment  in  Springfield,  Massachusetts,  which  establishment  is  currentlyscheduled for completion 
and opening in the third quarter of 2018. 
Under
 the  Massachusetts  Act,  the  Massachusetts  Gaming  Commission  (“Massachusetts  Commission”)  is  responsible  for  issuing  licenses  under  theMassachusetts
 Act and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons. The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau(“IEB”),
 which is a Bureau within the Massachusetts Commission, is responsible for conducting administrative investigations of applicants and licensees, and forgenerally
 enforcing the Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to enforce the law, the IEB coordinates with the MassachusettsState
 Police, Attorney General and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission in order to perform its duties. The Massachusetts Act also establishes a GamingEnforcement
 Division within the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office responsible for investigating and prosecuting criminal violations of the MassachusettsAct.
 The Massachusetts Commission has the authority to award up to three Category 1 licenses (table games and slot machines), and one Category 2 license (slotmachines only), within the Commonwe
alth of Massachusetts to qualified applicants. 
On
 December 23, 2013, the Massachusetts Commission determined that Blue Tarp and all applicable principal individuals and entities were qualified, andon
 November 6, 2014, the Massachusetts Commission awarded the sole Category 1 license in Region B of Massachusetts to Blue Tarp, effective November 7,2014.
 
While
 a Category 1 license has been awarded to Blue Tarp, Blue Tarp may not conduct gaming activities until an operations certificate has been issued bythe
 Massachusetts  Commission,  which  will  be  issued  upon  compliance  with  applicable  provisions  of  the  Massachusetts  Act  and  regulations  promulgatedthereunder,
 receipt of all required permits and approvals, compliance with the conditions of Blue Tarp’s Category 1 license, and Blue Tarp continuing to meetapplicable
 licensing,  registration,  qualification  and  other  regulatory  requirements.  Under  the  Massachusetts  Act,  a  Category  1  gaming  licensee  who  fails  tocommence
 operations within one year from the opening date approved by the Massachusetts Commission is subject to the suspension or revocation of its licenseand, if the Commission deter
mines that the gaming licensee acted in bad faith in its application, be assessed a fine of $50,000,000 or less. 
The
 initial license term is 15 years, which will commence upon the Massachusetts Commission’s approval of the commencement of the operation of thegaming
 establishment.  The  initial  license  fee  for  Category  1  licenses  is  $85,000,000,  as  determined  by  the  Massachusetts  Commission  and  authorized  by  theMassachusetts
 Act,  which  amount  Blue  Tarp  has  paid.  All  Category  1  and  Category  2  gaming  licensees  are  also  subject  to  additional  annual  fees  under  theMassachusetts Act. Category 1 li
censees must generally make on-going annual capital expenditures to their gaming establishments in a minimum aggregate amountequal to 3.5 percent of the n
et gaming revenues derived from the establishment. 
Under the
 Massachusetts Act, gaming establishments may be open 24 hours a day, and patrons must be 21 years of age to wager. Gaming beverage licensesmay be granted by the Massachusetts Commission for the sale and distri
bution of alcoholic beverages at the gaming establishment except (i) between the hours of 2a.m.
  and 8 a.m. outside of the gaming area and (ii) between the hours of 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. within the gaming area. The Massachusetts Act and regulations alsodescribe procedures for, 
and restrictions on, check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions within the gaming establishment.   
The Massachusetts Commission
, in particular the IEB, has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants forCategory
 1  and  Category  2  licenses,  affiliated  holding  or  intermediary  companies,  subsidiaries,  directors,  managers,  officers,  financiers  and  debt  holders,associates,
 key gaming executives and employees, other gaming related employees, and other persons or entities holding a five percent or greater direct or indirectinterest
 in  the  applicant,  are  qualified  under  the  Massachusetts  Act  (with  certain  exemptions  for  institutional  investors  in  the  discretion  of  the  MassachusettsCommission).
 
After
 a  Category  1  license  is  awarded,  the  Massachusetts  Commission  and  IEB  have  responsibility  for  the  continuing  regulation  and  licensing  of  thelicensee
 and its officers, directors, employees and other designated persons. The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition aCategory
 1 license, or any other license issued under the Massachusetts Act, and the IEB may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations. All licensesissued
 under the Massachusetts Act are expressly deemed a revocable privilege, conditioned on the licensee’s fulfillment of all conditions of licensure, compliancewith applicable laws
 
19

 and
 regulations,  and  the  licensee’s  continuing  qualification  and  suitability . Among  other  things,  the  Massachusetts  Commission  is  also  responsible  for  thecollection
 of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations of and monitoring applicants and licensees, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, andmay conduct inspections of th
e gaming establishment premises or the licensee’s records and equipment .  
The regulations promulgat
ed to implement the Massachusetts Act impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to licensing and on-goingoperations.
 The regulations include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning: licensing and registration of employees and vendors; accounting procedures andinternal
 controls;  surveillance  and security  requirements;  gaming  equipment,  devices and systems,  and device  registration  and testing;  self-exclusion;  on-goingreporting requirements related to construction, approvals and operations; temporary licensure; marketing and affirmative marketing plans; notification requirements
related
 to new or changes in shareholders, executives, and other qualifiers; notification and/or approval of certain material events and transactions; complimentaryservices; on-going
 capital expenditures; political contributions; credit issuance and customer transactions; auditing and record retention; facility design and gamingfloor
 plans; slot machine possession and transportation; table game rules and procedures; employee credentials; vendors and junkets; and count room and cageprocedures.
 
Generally,
 interests in a gaming establishment and Category 1 licenses may not be transferred without notification to and approval of the MassachusettsCommission. The sale, assignment, 
transfer, pledge or other disposition of any security issued by a corporation which holds a gaming license is conditional and willbe
 ineffective  if  disapproved  by  the  Massachusetts  Commission.  Category  1  licensees  may  also  not  change  their  business  governing  structure  without  thenotification
 and  approval  of  the  Massachusetts  Commission,  and  may  not  operate,  invest  in  or  own,  in  whole  or  in  part,  another  gaming  licensee’s  license  orgaming establishment.
 
The Massachusetts Commission retains the
 authority to promulgate, amend or repeal regulations concerning the Massachusetts Act, which, if enacted, couldadversely
 affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Massachusetts. Further, certain regulations are currently in draft form, and subject to furtherreview, revision and final 
approval.

AUDITORS’
REPORT 
To the Board of Directors
CityCenter Holdings, LLC
 
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of CityCenter Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprisethe consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 20
16, and the related consolidated statements of operations, members’ equity, and cash flows for eachof the three years in th
e period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
Management’s
Responsibility
for
the
Consolidated
Financial
Stat
ements 
Management
 is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principlesgenerally
 accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation andfair presentation of cons
olidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditors’
Responsibility
 
Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance withauditing
 standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether the co
nsolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
An
 audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Theprocedures
 selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,whether
 due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentationof
 the consolidated financial statements  in order to design audit procedures  that are appropriate  in the circumstances,  but not for the purpose of expressing anopinion
 on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness ofaccounting
 policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of theconsolidated financia
l statements. 
We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion
 
In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CityCenter Holdings,LLC
 and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2017, in accordanc
e with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

BASIS
OF

PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 
Basis

of
presentation.
The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries.  The  Company  does  not  have  avariable
 interest in any variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations arenot necessarily indica
tive of the results to be expected in the future. 
Management’s
use

of
estimates.
The  consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted inthe
 United States of America. Those principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assetsand liabilities
 and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses duringthe reporting period. Actua
l results could differ from those estimates. 
Fair

value
measurements.
Fair  value  measurements  affect  the  Company’s  accounting  for  and  impairment  assessments  of  its  long-lived  assets  andintangible
 assets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between marketparticipants
 at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy consisting of: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2inputs, which are observable inpu
ts for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. 
5

Exhibit
99.3 
Cash

and
cash
equivalents.
Cash  and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of ninety days or less at thedate of acquisition. Such inves
tments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 
Accounts

receivable
and
credit
risk.
The  Company  issues  markers  to  approved  casino  customers  following  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2017, approximately 65% of the Company’s casino receivables were due from customers from foreign countries. Enforceability issues, business oreconomic conditions or othe
r significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables. 
Trade
 receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off whenmanagement
 deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful accountsis
 maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their estimated realizable amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on aspecific
 review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as ofDecember 31, 2017, no significant 
concentrations of credit risk existed. 
Inventories.
Inventories  consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market.Cost
 is determined primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the costmethod.
 
Residential

real
estate.
As  of December 31, 2017, all residential units were sold. In prior periods, residential real estate represented capitalized costs ofresidential
 inventory, which consisted of completed condominium units available for sale less impairments previously recognized. Costs included land, direct andindirect construction 
and development costs, and capitalized property taxes and interest. 
Property

and
equipment.
Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  including  capitalized  interest.  Gains  or  losses  on  dispositions  of  property  andequipment
 are included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciablyprolong its life are ch
arged to expense as incurred. Property and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis: 
Buildings and improvements
 20 to 40 years Land improvements
 10 to 20 years Furniture and fixtures
 3 to 20 years Equipment
 3 to 15 years  
Project
 costs are stated at cost and recorded as property and equipment (which includes adjustments made upon the initial contribution by MGM Resorts tothe
 extent such property or equipment is contributed by MGM Resorts) unless determined to be impaired, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimatedfair value.
 
In
 December 2015, the Company decided to close the Zarkana show at the Aria Resort & Casino as part of a plan to expand its conference and conventionspace.
 As a result, the Company shortened the useful lives of the assets related to the Zarkana theatre and recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $82million
 and  $20  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2016  and  2015,  respectively.  The  fully  depreciated  assets  related  to  the  Zarkana  theatre  weredisposed in April 2016 and construction o
f the conference and expansion space began in May 2016, which opened during the first quarter of 2018. 
Capitalized

interest.
  The interest costs associated  with development  and construction  projects  are capitalized  and included in the cost of the project.Capitalization of int
erest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period. 
Impairment
of

long-lived
assets.
The  Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment as held and used. The Company reviews assets to beheld
 and used for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. It then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, tothe
 carrying amount of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment  is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do notexceed
 the  carrying  amount,  then  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset,  typically  measured  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  model.  Anyrecognized impairm
ent losses would be recorded as operating expense. 
Intangible

assets.
Indefinite-lived  intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances.The
 Company  performs  its  annual  impairment  test  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year.  See  Note  6  for  furtherdiscussion.  No impairments were 
indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review.6

Exhibit

Debt

issuance
costs
.  The  Company  capitalizes  debt  issuance  costs,  which  include  legal  and  other  direct  costs  related  to  the  issuance  of  debt.  Thecapitalized costs are amortized strai
ght-line to interest expense over the contractual term of the debt.
Revenue

recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
Casino  revenue  is  the  aggregate  net  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses,  with  liabilitiesrecognized
 for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the customers’ possession (“casino outstandingchip
 liability”). Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment,  retail and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and goods are provided.Advance deposits on rooms and advance 
ticket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer. 
Gaming
 revenues  are  recognized  net  of  certain  sales  incentives,  including  discounts  and  points  earned  in  point-loyalty  programs.  The  retail  value  ofaccommodations,
 food  and  beverage,  and  other  services  furnished  to  guests  without  charge  is  included  in  gross  revenue  and  then  deducted  as  promotionalallowances. The estimat
ed cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Real

estate
sales.
Revenue  for residential sales is deferred until closing occurs, which is when title, possession and other attributes of ownership have beentransferred
 to the buyer and the Company is not obligated to perform activities after the sale. Additionally, the buyer’s initial and continuing investment must beadequate to demonstrat
e a commitment to pay and the buyer’s receivable cannot be subject to future subordination.
Residential
 operating expenses include cost of real estate sold, holding costs, selling costs, indirect selling costs and valuation allowances for residentialmortgage notes receivable. Costs associated with residential sales were deferred during constr
uction, except for indirect selling costs and general and administrativeexpense, which were expensed as incu
rred. 
Loyalty

programs.
Aria  participates in the MGM Resorts’ “M life Rewards” loyalty program. Customers may earn points and/or Express Comps for theirgaming
 play which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the M life Rewards front desk at participating properties. Points may also be redeemed for freeslot
 play on participating machines. The Company records a liability based on the points earned multiplied by the redemption value, less an estimate for points notexpected
 to be redeemed, and records a corresponding reduction in casino revenue. Customers also earn Express Comps based on their gaming play which can beredeemed
 for complimentary goods and services, including hotel rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment. The Company records a liability for the estimatedcosts
 of providing goods and services for Express Comps based on the Express Comps earned multiplied by a cost margin, less an estimate for Express Comps notexpected to be redeem
ed and records a corresponding expense in the casino department. 
Advertising.
The  Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense is included in preopening and start-upexpenses
 when related to the preopening and start-up period and in general and administrative expense when related to ongoing operations. Advertising expensewas $14 million, $15 million and $20 m
illion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Property
transactions,
net.
The  Company classifies transactions related to long-lived assets – such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, andgains and losses on the sale of f
ixed assets – within “Property transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 9 for details. 
Income

taxes.
The  Company  is  treated  as  a  partnership  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  Therefore,  federal  income  taxes  are  the  responsibility  of  theMembers. As a result, no provision fo
r income taxes is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Comprehensive
income.
Net income equals compreh ensive income for all periods presented.

Recently

issued
accounting
standards.
In  May 2014, Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”)606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” which
 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arisingfrom
 contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific  guidance. Under the standard, revenue isrecognized when
 a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange forthose goods and services.
 
The
 Company adopted ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018, which will be reflected in future financial statements. The mostsignificant impacts o
f the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement are as follows: 
 
• Promotional  Allowances.  The Company  is  no  longer  permitted  to  recognize  revenues  for  goods  and services  provided  to  customers  for free  as  aninducement
 to  gamble  as  gross  revenue  with  a  corresponding  offset  to  promotional  allowances  to  arrive  at  net  revenues,  and  accordingly  thepromotional
 allowances line item will be removed in future filings. The majority of such amounts previously included in promotional allowances willnow offset casino revenues. This ch
ange will primarily result in a reclassification of revenue between revenue line items; 
 
• Loyalty  Accounting. Accounting for Express Comps granted under the M life Rewards program will be identified as separate performance obligationsand recorded
 as a reduction in gaming revenues when earned at the retail value of such benefits owed to the customer (less estimated breakage) and anincrease to the
 loyalty program liability representing outstanding performance obligations. Such amounts will be recognized as revenue in the line itemof
 the corresponding good or service provided when the performance  obligation is fulfilled. This change will result in an adjustment to beginningretained earnings of app
roximately $4 million as a result of the initial application of the standard and will not have a significant impact to earnings; 
 
• Gross  versus Net Presentation. Mandatory service charges on food and beverage and hotel offerings and wide area progressive operator fees will berecorded
 gross, that is, the amount received from the customer will be recorded as revenue with the corresponding amount paid as an expense. Thesechanges will primarily 
result in an increase in revenue with a corresponding increase in expense; and 
 
• Estimated  Cost of Promotional Allowances. The Company will no longer reclassify the estimated cost of complimentaries  provided to the gamingpatron
 from other expense line items to the casino expense line item. This change will result in a reclassification of expense between expense lineitems
 which  will  reduce  casino  expense  by  $74  million,  $72  million,  and  $74  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2017,  2016,  and  2015,respectively,
 and increase Rooms, Food and beverage, Retail, Entertainment and Other expenses. Refer to the “Revenue recognition and promotionalallowances”
 section  within  this  footnote  for  the  historical  amounts  that  will  be  materially  reclassified  back  to  each  expense  line  item  when  theretrospective adoption to
 prior years is reflected in future financial statements. 
These changes, and other less
 significant adjustments that were required upon adoption, will not have an aggregate material impact on operating income, netincome, the statemen

In
 February  2016,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  (“ASU”)  No.  2016-02,  “Leases  (Topic  842),”  (“ASU  2016-02”),  which  replaces  theexisting
 guidance in ASC 840, “Leases.” ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.ASU
 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both financeleases
 and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lesseewould
 recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. TheCompany is currently assessing th
e impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In
 August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (aconsensus
 of  the  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force),”  (“ASU  2016-15”),  effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2017.  ASU  2016-15  amends  theguidance
 of ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reducethe
 diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles, specifically clarifying the guidance on eight cash flow issues. The adoption of ASU2016-15 did not have a materi
al effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
Subsequent
events.
Management has evaluat ed subsequent events through February 19, 2018, the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.

The
 Company performs an annual review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter each year. The asset’s fair value iscompared
 to  its  carrying  value,  and  an  impairment  charge  is  recorded  for  any  short-fall.  Fair  value  is  estimated  using  the  relief-from-royalty  method  whichdiscounts
 cash  flows  that  would  be  required  to  obtain  the  use  of  the  related  intangible  asset.  Key  inputs  in  the  relief-from-royalty  analysis  include  forecastedrevenues related to the inta

The
 aircraft time sharing agreement intangible asset relates to an agreement between MGM Resorts and the Company whereby MGM Resorts provides theCompany
 the use of MGM Resorts’ aircraft in its operations. The Company is charged a rate that is based on Federal Aviation Administration regulations, whichprovides
 for  reimbursement  for  specific  costs  incurred  by  MGM  Resorts  without  any  profit  or  mark-up.  Accordingly,  the  fair  value  of  this  agreement  wasrecognized as an intangib
le asset, and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years, and will be fully amortized in 2029.

Senior

credit
facility.
In  April 2017, the Company completed a refinancing of its previous senior credit facility and entered into a $1.725 billion seniorcredit
 facility. The new senior credit facility consists of a $125 million revolving credit facility maturing in April 2022, and a $1.6 billion term loan B facilitymaturing
 in April 2024. The term loan B facility requires the Company to make amortization payments of 0.25% of the original principal balance at each quarterend.
 The term loan B facility was issued at 99.5%, and bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, and in the case of base rate loans, at thebase
 rate plus 1.50%. As of December 31, 2017, the interest rate on the term loan B was 4.07%. Loans under the revolving facility bear interest at LIBOR plus2.00%,
 and in the case of base rate loans, the base rate plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2017 the Company had not drawn on the revolving facility. The Companypays
 an applicable fee of 0.375%, for the unused portion of the revolving facility. The Company had $116 million of available borrowing capacity under its seniorcredit
 facility at December 31, 2017. In connection with the closing of the new senior credit facility, the Company refinanced the outstanding amount under itsexisting term
 loan. As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a loss on retirement of long-term debt of $4.6 million, primarily consisting of the write-offof a portion of previously unamo
rtized debt issuance costs. 
The senior credit facility
 is a general senior obligation of the Company and ranks equally with the Company’s other existing and future senior obligations, isfully
 and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the restricted subsidiaries of the Company, and is secured by a first-priority perfected lien onsubstantially all of th
e Company’s assets and the assets of its subsidiaries. 
The
 senior credit facility contains customary positive, negative and financial covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintains a quarterlyminimum
 interest coverage ratio of 2.5:1.0 and a maximum quarterly leverage ratio for the trailing four quarters of: 5.50:1.00 for September 30, 2017 throughSeptember
 30, 2018; and 5.00:1.00 for December 31, 2018 and thereafter.  The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31,2017.
 
Pursuant
 to the senior credit facility, the Company is required to make permanent repayments of principal based on an annual calculation of excess cashflow,
 as defined in the agreements. The percentage of excess cash flow required to be repaid is based on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the end of the fiscalyear, with 50%
 required to be repaid if the leverage ratio is greater than 5.0:1.0 as of the measurement date, 25% if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0:1.0and
 greater than 4.0:1.0, and no payment of excess cash flow is required if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.0:1.0. During 2017 and as of December 31,2017,
 the Company did not have excess cash flow required to be paid in accordance with the senior credit agreement for 2017.  During 2016 and as of December31, 2016, the Company did not have excess cash 
flow required to be paid in accordance with the senior credit agreement for 2016. 
Fair

value
of
long-term
debt.
The  estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $1.58billion and $1.26 billion, respe
ctively, and was determined using estimates based on trading prices of similar liabilities, a Level 2 input.11

SEGMENT
INFORMATION
 
The Company determines its segments based on
 the nature of the products and services provided. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has the followingreportable
 segments: Aria, Vdara and Mandarin Oriental. In prior periods, the Company has aggregated residential operations from Mandarin Oriental and Veerinto
 one  reportable  segment  “Residential”  given  the  similar  economic  characteristics  and  business  of  selling  and  leasing  high-rise  condominiums.  All  otheroperating
 segments are reported separately. The Company’s operating segments do not include certain corporate administrative costs. During 2016 the Companysold Crystals which was previously a repo
rtable segment. 
The
 Company analyzes the results of its operating segments’ operations based on Adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as earnings before interest and othernon-operating
 income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses,  NV  Energy  exit  expense,  and  property  transactions,net.
 The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is 1) a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuationof gaming companies.
 
While
 items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluating the Company’s or its segments’earnings
 performance,  it  is  useful  to  exclude  such  items  when  analyzing  current  results  and  trends  compared  to  other  periods  because  these  items  can  varysignificantly depending on
 specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, the Company believesexcluded items
 may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, write-downs and impairments includes normalrecurring
 disposals and gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within CityCenter, but also includes impairment charges which may not becomparable period over p
eriod.

NV

Energy.
In  July 2016, MGM Resorts, including the Company filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and will purchaseenergy, capacity, and/or 
ancillary services from a provider other than NV Energy. In September 2016, the Company paid an upfront impact payment of $14 million,of
 which $2 million was billed to third party entities and represented a reduction in the overall impact fee expense. Of this $2 million receivable for amounts billedto
 third party entities, $1 million is included in Accounts receivable, net as of both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company isrequired to make ongoing paym
ents to NV Energy for non-bypassable rate charges which primarily relate to its share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energycontracts
 which extend through 2040 and each entity’s share of the costs of decommissioning and remediation of coal-fired power plants in Nevada. During 2017,the
 terms of the ongoing impact fee obligations were modified. Such modifications included a credit to be applied against future non-bypassable rate charges andsubstantially
 shortened  the  period  over  which  MGM  Resorts,  including  the  Company,  is  responsible  for  such  charges,  with  an  end  date  in  2022.  As  such,  theCompany
 recognized a reduction in its liability for future charges of $8 million with a corresponding credit to “NV Energy exit expense.” As of December 31,2017,
 and 2016, the Company recorded an estimate of such liability on a discounted basis of $2 million and $2 million, respectively, in “Due to MGM ResortsInternational” and $4 m
illion and $13 million, respectively, in “Other long-term obligations.” 
Construction

litigation.
In  March 2010, Perini, general contractor for CityCenter, filed a lawsuit in the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County,State
 of Nevada, against MGM MIRAGE Design Group (a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts which was the original  party to the Perini constructionagreement)
 and certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Perini asserted, among other things, that CityCenter was substantially completed, but thedefendants failed
 to pay Perini approximately $490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor, equipment and materials expendedon CityCenter.
 
In
 April 2010, Perini served an amended complaint in this case which joined as defendants many owners of CityCenter residential condominium units (the“Condo
 Owner  Defendants”),  added  a  count  for  foreclosure  of  Perini's  recorded  master  mechanic’s  lien  against  the  CityCenter  property  in  the  amount  ofapproximately
 $491 million, and asserted the priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the Company, the Condo Owner Defendants and the Company’slenders
 in the CityCenter property.  In November 2012, Perini filed a second amended complaint which, among other things, added claims against the CityCenterdefendants
 of breach of contract (alleging that CityCenter’s Owner Controlled Insurance Program (“OCIP”) failed to provide adequate project insurance for Periniwith broad coverages and high limits), and tortious breach of the implied covena
nt of good faith and fair dealing (alleging improper administration by the Companyof
 the  OCIP  and  Builders  Risk  insurance  programs).  Prior  to  the  Final  Settlement,  as  defined  below,  the  Company  settled  the  claims  of  219  first-tier  Perinisubcontractors
 (including the claims of any lower-tier subcontractors that might have claims through those first-tier subcontractors). As a result of these settlementagreements
 and the prior settlement agreements between Perini and the Company, most but not all of the components of Perini’s non-Harmon-related lien claimagainst the Company were
 resolved. On February 24, 2014, Perini filed a revised lien for $174 million as the amount claimed by Perini and the remaining Harmon-related subcontractors.
 
In
 December 2014, the Perini matter was  concluded through a global settlement among the Company, MGM Resorts, Perini, the remaining subcontractors,including
 those implicated in the Harmon work (and their affiliates), and relevant insurers, which followed the previously disclosed settlement agreements and anextra-judicial
 program  for  settlement  of  certain  project  subcontractor  claims.  This  global  settlement  concluded  all  outstanding  claims  in  the  case  (the  “FinalSettlement”).
 The effectiveness of the global settlement was made contingent upon the Company’s execution of certain indemnity and release agreements (whichwere executed in
14

Exhibit
99.3 
January
 2015)  and  the  Company’s  procurement  of  replacement  general  liability  insurance  covering  construction  of  the  CityCenter  development  (which  wasobtained in January 2015).
 
The
 Final  Settlement,  together  with  previous  settlement  agreements  relating  to  the  non-Harmon  related  lien  claims,   resolved  all  of  Perini’s  and  theremaining
 subcontractors’  lien  claims  against  the  Company  and  MGM  Resorts,  certain  direct  and  indirect  subsidiaries,  MGM  Resorts  International  Design(formerly known
 as MGM MIRAGE Design Group), and the Condo Owner Defendants. However, the Company expressly reserved any claims for latent or hiddendefects as to
 any portion of CityCenter’s original construction (other than the Harmon) not known to the Company at the time of the agreement.  The Company andMGM Resorts entered into the Final Se
ttlement solely as a compromise and settlement and not in any way as an admission of liability or fault.   
The key terms of the Final Set
tlement included:   
With
 respect to its non-Harmon lien claims, Perini waived a specific portion of its lien claim against the Company, which combined with the prior non-Harmon
 agreement and accrued interest resulted in a total payment to Perini of $153 million. The total payment to Perini was funded by MGM Resorts under theircompletion guarantee
 and included the application of approximately $58 million of condominium proceeds that were previously held in escrow by the Company tofund construction lien cl
aims upon final resolution of the Perini litigation. 
The
 Company’s recovery for its Harmon construction defect claims, when added to the Harmon-related proceeds from prior insurance settlements of $85million, resulted
 in gross cash settlement proceeds to the Company of approximately $191 million (of which approximately $18 million was paid by MGM Resortsto CityCenter under the compl
etion guarantee in February 2015). 
In
 conjunction with the Final Settlement, MGM Resorts and an insurer participating in the OCIP resolved their arbitration dispute concerning such insurersclaim for
 payments it made under the OCIP general liability coverage for contractor costs incurred in the Harmon litigation, premium adjustments and certain othercosts and expenses. MGM Resorts settled 
this dispute for $38 million, and funded the majority of such amounts under the completion guarantee in January 2015. 
Harmon.
As discussed above, a global settlement was reached in the Perini litigation in December 2014, which finally resolved all outstanding liens, claims and
 counterclaims  between  the  Company  and  MGM  Resorts  on  one  hand,  and  Perini,  the  remaining  subcontractors  and  remaining  insurers  on  the  other  hand.Among
 the  matters  resolved  were  the  Company’s  claims  against  Perini  and  other  contractors  and  subcontractors  with  respect  to  construction  at  the  Harmon.Pursuant
 to leave of court in 2014, the Company commenced demolition of the building. The Company has completed a partial demolition of the building and iscurrently evaluating op
tions for further demolition and plans for the future use of the remaining structure. 
Other

litigation.
The  Company  is  a  party  to  various  legal  proceedings  that  relate  to  construction  and  operational  matters  incidental  to  its  business.Management
 does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. TheCompany
 maintained  an  OCIP  during  the  construction  and  development  process.  Under  the  OCIP,  certain  insurance  coverages  may  cover  a  portion  of  theCompany’s general liabil
ity, workers compensation, and other potential liabilities. 
Other
guarantees.
The Company  is party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of creditissued
 by financial institutions. The Company’s available borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.  AtDecember 31, 2017, the Company had $9 mil
lion in a letter of credit outstanding.

um obligations under non-cancelable leases are immaterial in each of the next five years, and in total.
