New Brunswick, N.J. (August 30, 2023) – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (“the Company”) today announced updates to its financials and
2023 guidance which reflect its operations as a company focused on transformational innovation in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The
Company has published a recorded webinar for investors to provide additional context behind the updated financials and 2023 guidance
found in this release, which may be accessed by visiting the Investors section of the Company's website at webcasts & presentations.
“The completion of this transaction uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a Pharmaceutical and MedTech company focused on delivering
transformative healthcare solutions to patients,” said Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. “We are incredibly
proud of the focus and dedication of our employees worldwide to achieve this milestone, which we are confident will unlock near- and long-
term value for all of our stakeholders.”
As previously announced, the Company recently completed an exchange offer to finalize the separation of Kenvue Inc., formerly Johnson &
Johnson’s Consumer Health business. As a result of the completion of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson will now present its
Consumer Health business financial results as discontinued operations, including a gain of approximately $20 billion in the third quarter of
2023.
Unless otherwise noted, the financial results and earnings guidance included below have been recast to reflect the continuing operations of
Johnson & Johnson.

UPDATED FULL-YEAR 2023 GUIDANCE:
Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict with
reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses and purchase
accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material
to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP.

Full Year 2023 Projected Average Shares Outstanding (Diluted) only reflects impact from the Kenvue exchange offer
Note: percentages may have been rounded
Following completion of the Kenvue exchange offer, the Company has reduced its outstanding share count by the approximately 191 million
shares of common stock accepted in the exchange offer.
The weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the August 2023 Guidance for Adjusted Diluted EPS reflects the net
reduction of approximately 73.5 million shares of Johnson & Johnson outstanding common stock as a result of the Kenvue exchange offer.
Because this net reduction occurred on August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson will recognize only a partial-year benefit of $0.28 to its full-year
2023 Adjusted Diluted EPS.
The Company generated $13.2 billion in cash proceeds as result of the Kenvue debt offering and initial public offering. Additionally, Johnson
& Johnson maintains a 9.5% stake in Kenvue common stock, which provides the Company the opportunity to monetize the retained stake in
a tax efficient manner in the next year, subject to a6

The Company will maintain its quarterly dividend of $1.19 per share.

 See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings from continuing operations,"
"adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations," and "adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be
considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, net earnings from continuing operations,
net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and effective tax rate from continuing operations on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures
provide useful information to investors. Among other things, these measures may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various
periods, these measures may exclude such items as intangible asset amortization expense, significant gains from divestitures, significant costs associated with acquisitions, restructuring,
litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that
sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the
performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings from
continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, net earnings from continuing operations, net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and effective tax rate
from continuing operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings from
continuing operations, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations may not be comparable with the
calculation of similar measures for other companies. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the
Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as intangible asset amortization expense, significant gains from divestitures, the effects of an
acquisition, restructuring, litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters) and do not provide a comparable view of the
Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior
to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.(1) (A)

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings from continuing operations,"
"adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations," and "adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not
be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, net earnings from continuing
operations, net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and effective tax rate from continuing operations on an adjusted basis because management believes that these
measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, these measures may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In
various periods, these measures may exclude such items as intangible asset amortization expense, significant gains from divestitures, significant costs associated with acquisitions,
restructuring, litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and
of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and
evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike
earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, net earnings from continuing operations, net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and
effective tax rate from continuing operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net
earnings from continuing operations, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations may not be
comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide
a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as intangible asset amortization expense, significant gains from divestitures, the effects
of an acquisition, restructuring, litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters) and do not provide a comparable view of the
Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior
to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.(1) (A)

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE “Adjusted operational sales growth" excludes acquisitions, divestitures and translational
currency and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as
replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Due to the variable nature of
acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact they may have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends,
management believes that providing this measure enhances an investor’s understanding of the Company’s performance and may assist
in the evaluation of ongoing business operations period over period. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented to permit investors
to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company, including for internal evaluation of the
performance of the Company's businesses and planning and forecasting for future periods. The use of this non-GAAP financial
measure as a performance measure is limited in that it provides a view of the Company's results of operations without including all
events during a period and may not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to that of other companies in the health
