Item 1.
Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated here
in by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations,estimates, and projections as of the da
te of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of PartI—“Risk Factors.”
Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporat
ed in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate officesare located in Seatt
le, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Marketunder the symbol “AMZN.”
As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” 
“our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.General
Amazon.com opened its virtua
l doors on the World Wide Web in July 1995. We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by fourprinciples: customer obs
ession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of oursegments, we serve our prima
ry customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, suchas advertising services 
and co-branded credit card agreements.We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the waythe Company evaluates its busin
ess performance and manages its operations. Additional information on our operating segments and our net sales is contained inItem 8 of Part II, “Financ
ial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.” Our company-sponsored research and development expense isset forth within “Technology and 
content” in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Consolidated Statements of Operations.” Thefinancial results of 
Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition onAugust 28, 2017.
Consumers
We serve consumers through our 
retail websites and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our websites to enablehundreds of millions of unique produ
cts to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through ourwebsites, mobile apps, Alexa, and physi
cally visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, FireTVs, and Echo devices, and we develop and produc
e media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday productpricing and shipping offers, and 
to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-usefunctionality, fast and relia
ble fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited freeshipping on tens of millions of i
tems, access to unlimited instant streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.We fulfill custome
r orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrang
ements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, whichare supplemented by co-sour
ced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”Sellers
We offer programs tha
t enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites, and fulfill orders throughus. We are not the selle
r of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, forour seller programs.
Developers and Enterprises
We serve developers and en
terprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, whichoffers a broad set of globa
l compute, storage, database, and other service offerings.3

Table of ContentsContent Creators
We serve authors and independ
ent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a 70%royalty option and make the
ir books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs thatallow authors, musicians, fi
lmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content.Competition
Our businesses encompass a large v
ariety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete isevolving rapidly and intense
ly competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current andpotential competito
rs include: (1) online, offline, and multichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products weoffer and sell to consume
rs and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distributionchannels; (3) web search eng
ines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, oracquiring goods an
d services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including websitedevelopment, advertising, 
fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or forthird parties, whether onl
ine or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-basedinfrastructure and other ser
vices; and (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices. Webelieve that the principal com
petitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additionalcompetitive facto
rs for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability andwillingness to change business pra
ctices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brandrecognition, and greate
r control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursuerestrictive distr
ibution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers withrestrictive ter
ms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and thedevelopment of new business models 
and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliancesthat strengthen their 
competitive positions.Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectualproperty as critica
l to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements withour employees, customers, pa
rtners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. andinternational domain n
ames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain ofour proprietary technology. 
We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.Seasonality
Our business is affected by season
ality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Werecognized 33%, 32%, and 
34% of our annual revenue during th e fourth quarter of 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Fourth quarter 2017 results inc lude revenue attributableto Whole Foods Market, which we acquir
ed on August 28, 2017.Employees
We employed approximately 
566,000 full-time and part -time employees as of December 31, 2017 . However, employment levels f luctuate due to seasonalfactors affecting ou
r business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils,statutory employee rep
resentation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within theUnited States. We consider our 
employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly forsoftware engineers, comput
er scientists, and other technical staff.Available Information

Risk Factors Please carefully consid
er the following risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flowscould be materially adversely
 affected. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.We Face Intense Competition
Our businesses are rapidly evolv
ing and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services,digital content and el
ectronic devices, and web and infrastructure computing services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longerhistories, more custome
rs, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. Theymay secure better t
erms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.Competition may intensify, 
including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as ourcompetitors enter in
to business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. Inaddition, new and enhanced techno
logies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase ourcompetition. The Intern
et facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources
We are rapidly and signi
ficantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure tosupport our retail and serv
ices businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,operations, systems,
 technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growtheffectively, which could d
amage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competi
tiveRisks
We may have limited o
r no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These offerings may present newand difficult technology 
challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other qualityissues. In addition, profitab
ility, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these neweractivities to recoup ou
r investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operatingresults.
We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate
We may not be able to ac
curately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of ourexpenses and investments is f
ixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.Our revenue growth may not be sustain
able, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on thecontinued growth of demand for th
e products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditionsworldwide. A softening of demand, whether 
caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreasedrevenue or growth.
Our sales and operating resul
ts will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following:•
our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;•
our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;•
our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;•
the introduction of competitive websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;•
changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;•
timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;6

the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computerintrusions, outages, and simil

Our international activities are
 significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments,we have relatively li
ttle operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, andmaintain internat
ional operations and websites, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•
local economic and political conditions;•
government regulation of e-commerce and other services, electronic devices, and competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as tradeprotection measures, in
cluding export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;•
restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, includinguncertainty as a result of
 less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regardingthe physical and digital
 distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;•
business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;•
limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•
limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•
shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•
laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;•
lower levels of use of the Internet;•
lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;•
lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;•
difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•
different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;7

Table of Contents•
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officialsand other third parties;
•
laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and•
geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.As international e-com
merce and other online and web services grow, competition will intensify. Local companies may have a substantial competitiveadvantage because of the
ir greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able tohire, train, retain, 
and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth.The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Ind
ia regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and licenserequirements that may restrict (i) f
oreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internetcontent, and (iii) the s
ale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements,www.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies tha
t are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technologyservices in China in conjunct
ion with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indiancompanies by foreign enti
ties involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics servicesto third-party selle
rs to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on thewww.amazon.in marketplace. Although we b
elieve these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is activelyconsidering changes i
n its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretationof PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and i
t is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indianbusinesses and operations may be un
able to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractualrelationships with respec
t to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC,Indian or other laws or regul
ations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines andother financial pena
lties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to shut down entirely.If We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our Fulfillm
ent Network and Data Centers, Our Business Could Be HarmedIf we do not adequately predi
ct customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result inexcess or insufficient 
fulfillment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, or harm our business in other ways. As wecontinue to add fulfill
ment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks becomeincreasingly complex and op
erating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.In addition, a failure 
to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We andour co-sourcers may be unabl
e to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we performinventory fulfillmen
t services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may beunable to optimize our fu
lfillment network.We rely on a limited nu
mber of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiateacceptable terms with these c
ompanies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customerexperience. In addition, ou
r ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclementweather, fire, flood, power loss, 
earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors.Under some of our commerci
al agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory andoperating our fulfill
ment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demandwould result in unexpected costs 
and other harm to our business and reputation.8

Table of ContentsThe Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
We expect a disproportion
ate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amountssuch that we fail to mee
t customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to takesignificant inventory m
arkdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shippingcost due to complimenta
ry upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too manycustomers access our websit
es within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websitesunavailable or prevent us 
from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. Inaddition, we may be unable to ad
equately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillmentcompanies and customer se
rvice co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating tofulfillment network opt
imization and inventory.We generally have paym
ent terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers.As a result of holiday sales, as o
f December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (otherthan as a result of cash f
lows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payableas of December 31. Our accounts pay
able balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cashequivalents, and marketable
 securities balances.Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strat
egic Alliances, and OtherBusiness Relationships
We provide e-commer
ce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under theseagreements, we provide web serv
ices, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or servicesthrough our websites. These arrang
ements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which maylimit the amount of busin
ess we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, whichmay include web services, fu
lfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software,and engaging third parties 
to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on thevolume of the other company
’s sales. Therefore, if the other company’s offering is not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or theagreement may be terminated. M
oreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We alsomay be subject to clai
ms from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.As our agreements termin
ate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter intoamendments on less favorab
le terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operatingresults.
Our present and fut
ure e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
impairment of other relationships;•
variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and•
difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired and inves
ted in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. Thesetransactions (such as our a
cquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc.) create risks such as:•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•
problems retaining key personnel;•
additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;•
the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;9

Table of Contents•
the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result ofany integration of opera
tions;•
the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;•
the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;•
the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, andother administrative systems
 to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;•
for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on theinvestee’s accounting, f
inancial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;•
the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;•
the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;•
potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and•
for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, andregulatory risks associate
d with specific countries.As a result of future acquis
itions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, oramortization expenses 
related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, ifat all. In addition, valu
ations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We coulddetermine that such valuatio
ns have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, 
and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international websites and product and service offerings areexposed to foreign exchange r
ate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains orlosses on the remeasurem
ent of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations hasincreased. We also hold c
ash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S. Dollarstrengthens compared to
 these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and viceversa.
The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel Could Negatively Affe
ct Our BusinessWe depend on our senior manage
ment and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “keyperson” life insurance po
licies. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business.We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches
As a result of our services be
ing web-based and the fact that we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, for ourcustomers, failure to p
revent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems, could expose us or ourcustomers to a risk of loss or 
misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, and otherwise harmour business. We use third-par
ty technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology,employee email, cont
ent delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some subsidiaries had past security breaches, and, although they did nothave a material adv
erse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed systems andprocesses that are design
ed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reducethe impact of a secur
ity breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.10

Table of ContentsWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy
We experience occas
ional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us fromefficiently fulf
illing orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we areunable to continually add sof
tware and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of oursystems, it could cause syste
m interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.Our computer and communica
tions systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure,earthquakes, acts of war or 
terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events couldcause system interrupt
ion, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which couldmake our product and servic
e offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not besufficient. In addition, we 
may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and beexpensive to remedy.
We Face Significant Inventory Risk
In addition to risks describ
ed elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed tosignificant inventory r
isks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles andpricing, defective m
erchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage,and other factors. We end
eavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand forproducts, however, can change signi
ficantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling ormanufacturing a new product, 
it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecastdemand. The acquisition of c
ertain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry abroad selection and signif
icant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities orduring the relevant sel
ling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intell
ectual Property Rights or May Be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third PartiesWe regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical toour success, and we rely on trade
mark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,customers, and others to prot
ect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products andservices are made av
ailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore,regulations governing domain n
ames may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiringdomain names that are s
imilar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.We may not be able to discov
er or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights alsomay take actions that dimini
sh the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure ofsignificant financi
al and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or preventthird parties from in
fringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquireequivalent or superior t
echnology or other intellectual property rights.Other parties also may c
laim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legalproceedings regarding al
leged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in theexpenditure of signific
ant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations.We may need to obtain li
censes from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to usor at all. In addition, we m
ay not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual propertywe do not own. These risks have been ampli
fied by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.Our digital content offeri
ngs depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rightsmanagement technology th
at we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to includetheir content in our serv
ice.11

Table of ContentsWe Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highl
y VolatileWe have a rapidly evolving bus
iness model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risksdescribed elsewhere in th
is Item 1A, as well as:•
changes in interest rates;•
conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;•
quarterly variations in operating results;•
fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;•
changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;•
changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•
changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and•
transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.Volatility in our stock pri
ce could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees orgrant larger stock awards 
than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, orboth.
Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business
We are subject to gene
ral business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices,and other services. Existing 
and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection,pricing, content, cop
yrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption,environmental regulation, electr
onic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, trade and protectionist measures, webservices, the provision of onl
ine payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, thedesign and operation of websites, h
ealth and sanitation standards, the characteristics and quality of products and services, product labeling, and the commercialoperation of unmanned air
craft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to theInternet, e-comme
rce, digital content, and web services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our sellerprograms. Unfavorable regul
ations and laws could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.We Could Be Subject to Additional Sales Tax or Other Tax Liabiliti
esAn increasing number of stat
es and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices, with or without notice, that impose newtaxes on all or a portion of g
ross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect transactiontaxes such as sales, consumption, v
alue added, or similar taxes. We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly,or at all. Failure to co
mply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxeswhere we do not, could result in substan
tial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. In addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictionswhere we are already subje
ct to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were successfully to challenge our positions, our tax liability could increase substantially.In the U.S., although Supreme Court decisions 
restrict states’ rights to require remote sellers to collect state and local sales taxes, the Supreme Court has recentlyagreed to hear a case 
that could overturn prior precedent. We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under anationwide system.
We are also subject to 
U.S. (federal and state) and foreign laws, regulations, and administrative practices that require us to collect information from ourcustomers, vendors, merchan
ts, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies. The scope of suchrequirements continues 
to expand, requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could resultin significant penalties.
We Could Be Subject to Additional Income Tax Liabilit
iesWe are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices invarious jurisdictions may b
e subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment isrequired in evaluating 
and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business forwhich the ultimate tax determi
nation is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany12

Table of Contentstransactions, the rel
ative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates andhigher than anticipat
ed in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which weare not able to real
ize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existingbusinesses and operations, acquis
itions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred taxassets and liabiliti
es and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, andinterpretations. In add
ition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recentlyenacted U.S. tax reform leg
islation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enacttax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act 
that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.The 2017 Tax Act significantly ch
anges how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were notpreviously required in U.S. tax law, sign
ificant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates incalculations, and the pr
eparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and otherstandard-setting bodies cou
ld interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from ourinterpretation. As we compl
ete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may makeadjustments to provisional 
amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments aremade.
We are also current
ly subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments inan audit, litigation, or 
the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results orcash flows in the period or per
iods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices ofProposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for t
ransactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreignsubsidiaries and we have been con
testing the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in theIRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach f
rom the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactionsundertaken with our foreign subsid
iaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. W
e will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or ifthe IRS were to successfully asse
rt transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject tosignificant additiona
l tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the taxauthorities in Luxembourg with 
regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October4, 2017, the European Commission announced i
ts decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules onstate aid. This decision ord
ers Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decisionto be without merit and will 
consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision.While the European Commission 
announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxessubject to recovery is to b
e calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Although we believe our taxestimates are reasonable, the fi
nal outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income taxprovisions and accruals.
Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppl
iers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,manufacturing, and any re
lated ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guaranteeavailability of me
rchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stopselling or licensing me
rchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplierbankruptcies due to poor econom
ic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers ina timely and effic
ient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code ofstandards and responsibilit
ies, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit ourgrowth, and negatively affe
ct our operating results.13

Table of ContentsWe May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Rela
ted Procurement RegulationsOur contracts with U.S., as well as stat
e, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirementsrelating to their fo
rmation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and anyviolations could result in v
arious civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments,forfeiture of profi
ts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination bythe government at any ti
me, without cause.We May Be Subject to Product Liability Cla
ims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or ManufactureSome of the products we sell or m
anufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, orenvironmental or proper
ty damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce services thatmay increase our exposure 
to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liabilityinsurance, we cannot
 be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us oneconomically reasonab
le terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks
We accept payments using
 a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debitfrom a customer’s bank a
ccount, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to ourcustomers, we may bec
ome subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processesthat could result in signi
ficant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debitcards, we pay interchange and o
ther fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to providecertain Amazon-branded p
ayment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, andpromotional financing. In 
each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card program
s, which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules,including data security 
rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficultor impossible for us to comply. 
If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may beliable for card issuing b
anks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers,process electronic funds 
transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.In addition, we provide regula
ted services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to thirdparties, and because we provid
e services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these jurisdictions, we may be subject to requirements forlicensing, regulatory insp
ection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, andauthentication. We a
re also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, internationalmoney transfers, privacy 
and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could besubject to additional r
equirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.We Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sell
ersThe law relating to the l
iability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies could require changes inthe way this business is conducted. Under ou
r seller programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, whenbuyers never receive th
e products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions. Under our A2Z Guarantee, wereimburse buyers for paym
ents up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and couldnegatively affect ou
r operating results. We also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods, selling goodsin an unlawful manner, or viol
ating the proprietary rights of others, and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers.14

in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”Overview
Our primary source of revenue is the sale o
f a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered through our consumer-facingwebsites and physical stores pr
imarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, andwe also manufacture and se
ll electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize ournet share of revenue of i
tems sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection,across numerous product cat
egories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital contentsubscriptions, advertising, and 
co-branded credit cards.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainab
le growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income andefficiently manag
ing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operatingincome primarily r
esult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make inlonger-term strat
egic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including loweringprices, improving availabilit
y, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expandingproduct information, imp
roving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.We seek to reduce our variabl
e costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include p roduct and content costs, payment processingand related transac
tion costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and aportion of our marketing cos
ts. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to ourwebsites and web services, our el
ectronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and physical stores. Variable costsgenerally change dire
ctly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion,and other factors. To decr
ease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increasediscounts from suppliers, and r
educe defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a leanculture.

Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.19

Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inv
entory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 3 . On average, our high inventory velocitymeans we generally collect fr
om consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affectedby numerous factors, including ou
r product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability andselection of product off
erings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.We also expect some var
iability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of salesby third-party sellers, 
the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of paymentterms with suppliers.
We expect spending in te
chnology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, andmerchandising employees. Our technology and con
tent investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due togeographic expansion and the cross-func
tionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, includingAWS, and expansion of new and existing product 
categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience andimprove our process efficienc
ies. We believe that advan ces in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wirelessconnectivity, will continu
e to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of thesecontinued advances in techno
logy, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are alsoinvesting in AWS, which offers a broad s
et of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to effici
ently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions,and aligning employee compensation with shareho
lders’ interests. We utilize restr icted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because webelieve this compensat
ion model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested andunvested stock awards outstanding, withou
t regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 497 million and 504million 
as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. Our financial reporting currency is 
the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens y
ear-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses willbe higher than if curren
cies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, ourconsolidated net sales and op
erating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond theU.S. economy through our growing internation
al businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operatingresults and growth rates befo
re and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasu
rement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreigncurrency exchange rat
es. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidatedtrends and comparisons.

Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Judgments
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates andassumptions that affec
t the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in theconsolidated financia
l statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to theportrayal of the company
’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, oftenas a result of the need to 
make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies andjudgments addressed below. We a
lso have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant tounderstanding our results. For addi
tional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business andAccounting Policies.” Although we beli
eve that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.Actual results may diff
er significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va
lue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus
tomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptionsabout future disposition of inv
entory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in thefuture. As a measure of sensi
tivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 , we would have recorded an addition al costof sales of approximate
ly $180 million.In addition, we enter into suppl
ier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.These commitments ar
e based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income Taxes
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices invarious jurisdictions may b
e subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment isrequired in evaluating 
and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business forwhich the ultimate tax determi
nation is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relativeamount of our foreign earn
ings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions where we have high
er statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize therelated tax benefi
t, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations,acquisitions (including in
tegrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities andtheir valuation, and chang
es in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, anumber of countries are 
actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislationcommonly referred to 
as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017Tax Act that could result in 
further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.The 2017 Tax Act significantly ch
anges how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were notpreviously required in U.S. tax law, sign
ificant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates incalculations, and the pr
eparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and otherstandard-setting bodies cou
ld interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from ourinterpretation. As we compl
ete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may makeadjustments to provisional 
amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments aremade.
We are also current
ly subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments inan audit, litigation, or 
the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results orcash flows in the period or per
iods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices ofProposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for t
ransactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer21

Table of Contentspricing with our foreign subsidi
aries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decisionregarding the issues rais
ed in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and2006 for the transactions unde
rtaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed anotice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appe
als for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision werereversed on appeal or if 
the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, wecould be subject to signifi
cant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whetherdecisions by the tax authori
ties in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules onstate aid. On October 4, 2017, the Europe
an Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply withEuropean Union rules on state aid. Th
is decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014.We believe this decis
ion to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the EuropeanCommission’s decision. While 
the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amountof additional taxes subje
ct to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Althoughwe believe our tax estimate
s are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from ourhistorical income t
ax provisions and accruals.Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Cash flow information, which ref

 Year Ended December 31,  
2015  2016  2017 Cash provided by (used in):
     Operating activities
$ 12,039  $17,272  $18,434 Investing activities
(6,450 )  (9,876 )  (27,819 ) Financing activities
(3,882 )  (3,740 )  9,860 Our principal sources of liqu
idity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fairvalue, were $ 
19.8 billion , $26.0 billion , and $31.0 billion as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Amounts held in foreign curren cies were $7.3 billion , $9.1 billion 
, and $11.1 billion , as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , and were primarily Euros, Jap anese Yen, and British Pounds.Cash 
provided by (used in) operating activities was $12.0 billion , $17.3 billion , and $18.4 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from
 our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded creditcard agreements, offset by
 cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use softwarethat are reflec
ted as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-termobligations. Cash received f
rom our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buyfrom us, our receivables 
from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2016 , compared to the compar able prior year period, was primarilydue to the increase in ne
t income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. The increase in operating cash flow in 
2017 , compared to the compar able prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation,amortization, and stock
-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activiti es is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at anyspecific point in tim
e is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments,vendor payment terms, and f
luctuations in foreign exchange rates.22

Table of ContentsCash 
provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software andwebsite development costs, in
centives received from property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies andintellectual prope
rty rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(6.5) billion , $(9.9)billion 
, and $(27.8) billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , with the variability c aused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease propertyand equipment, and purchases, m
aturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $ 4.6 billion , $ 6.7 billion , and $10.1 billion in 2015 , 2016 
, and 2017 , which primarily refl ect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued businessgrowth in technology infrastru
cture (the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $528 million , $417 million , and 
$311 million for internal-use softwa re and website development in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Stock-based compensation cap italized for internal-use softwareand website development costs do
es not affect cash flows. In 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition andother investment activity of 
$795 million , $116 million , and $14.0 billion . Cash 
provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.9) billion , $(3.7) billion , and $9.9 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal re
payments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principalrepayments on obligations r
elated to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $4.2 billion , $4.4 billion , and $6.4 billion in 
2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Property and equipment acqui red under capital leases were $4.7 billion , $5.7 billion , and $9.6 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , with the 
increase reflecting investm ents in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investmentswe expect to continue over t
ime. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt. Proceeds from long-term debt andother were 
$353 million , $621 million , and $16.2 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . During 2017, cash inflows from financ ing activities consisted primarily of netproceeds from the issuanc
e of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from notes issued in August2017 (the “August 2017 Notes”) were used to fund 
the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay the 1.200% Notes due November 2017,and for general corpora
te purposes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt” for additional discussion ofthe notes.
We had no borrowings outstanding under our $3.0 b
illion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $592 million of borrowings outstanding under our 
$600 million secured revolving credi t facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2017 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan cial Statementsand Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Te
rm Debt” for additional information. In 
2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $950 million , $1.4 billion , and $769 million . The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandato ry one-time tax on accumula
ted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had beenaccrued have now been subject 
to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to invest most or all of these earnings, aswell as our capital in th
ese subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional taxes related to such amounts. As ofDecember 31, 2017, cash, cash equiva
lents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $9.6 billion.We have tax benefits relating
 to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce ourU.S. taxable income. The 2017 Tax Act ext
ended through 2026 and enhanced the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. Cashtaxes paid (net of refunds
) were $273 million , $412 million , and $957 million for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . As of December 31, 2017 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approxim
ately $226 million and we had approximately $855 million of federal tax credits potentiall y available to offset future tax liabilities.Our federal tax credi
ts are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits weexpect cash paid for tax
es to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with itsOctober 2017 decision against us on st
ate aid, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest.The actual amount of addi
tional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission'sguidance. Once the recovery 
amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including interest, into escrow, where it will remain pendingconclusion of all appeals. 
We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated recovery amount announced by the European Commission.Our liquidity is also affe
cted by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, workers’ compensation obligations, amounts dueto third-party selle
rs in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certaintypes of stored value to our cus
tomers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion ofour cash and cash equivalents 
from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on ourconsolidated balance she
ets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $600 million and $1.3 billion . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan
cial Statements and Supplementary Data23

Table of Contents—Note 7—Commitments and Contingenci
es” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally,purchase obligations and open pur
chase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $13.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 . These purchase obligations and op
en purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash 
flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing availableunder our credit agree
ments, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cashneeds and cash flows are subjec
t to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity ordebt securities, obtain cre
dit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase,refinance, or otherwise 
restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.The sale of additional equ
ity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider theacquisition of, or investm
ent in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidityrequirements or cause us 
to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines orfinancing instruments wil
l be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.24

Table of ContentsResults of Operations
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Marketfrom the date of acquis
ition. In Q1 2017, we combined stock-based compensation and “Other operating expense, net” with operating expenses in our presentationof segment results. These seg
ments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “FinancialStatements and Supplementa
ry Data—Note 11—Segment Information.”Net Sales
Net sales include product and s
ervice sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media contentwhere we record revenue gross. Serv
ice sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digitalcontent subscriptions, cer
tain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product salesand service sales and amo
rtized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):

and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The 
increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the compar able prior year periods, is primarily due toincreased unit sales, in

Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video andmusic, packaging supplies, sort
ation and delivery center and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are thetransportation servic
e provider.The 
increase in cost of sales in absolute do llars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the compar able prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product andshipping costs resulting from 
increased sales.Shipping costs to receive produc
ts from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.Shipping costs, which include sortat
ion and delivery center and transportation costs, were $11.5 billion , $16.2 billion , and $21.7 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . We expect our cost of shipping 
to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shippingrates, we use more expensive sh
ipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving highersales volumes, optimizing ou
r fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offeringlow prices to our customers is 
fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment ar
e primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internaltechnology requirements 
and external sales to AWS customers.27

Table of ContentsFulfillment
Fulfillment costs primarily c
onsist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer servicecenters, and physical stor
es and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs areprimarily classif
ied as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing andrelated transact
ion costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment networkand physical store expansion, th
e extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affectcustomer service cont
acts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, becausepayment processing and fulf
illment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and paymentprocessing and related t
ransaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costsas a percent of net sales.
The 
increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the compar able prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costscorresponding with increased p
roduct and service sales volume and inventory levels, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physicalstores.
We seek to expand our fulfi
llment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes fromsales of our own products as well as sa
les by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Marketing
We direct customers 
to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, Associates program,social and online advert
ising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates.To the extent there is in
creased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see acorresponding change in our ma
rketing costs.The 
increase in marketing costs in absolu te dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the compar able prior year periods, is primarily due to payroll and relatedexpenses, as well as increas
ed spending on online marketing channels.While costs associated wi
th Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effectiveworldwide marketing tools, and in
tend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products andservices, development, des
ign, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructurecosts. Infrastructure 
costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS,as well as these and other e
fforts. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to ourcustomers.
We seek to invest effi
ciently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our processefficiency through rap
id technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spendingprojects often support a va
riety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expectspending in technology and content 
to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segmentsbased on usage. The increase in 
technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the compar able prior year periods, is primarilydue to increased payroll 
and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introducenew products and service offe
rings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure.For 
2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we capitalized $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation ), $511 million (including $94 million of stock-based compensation), 
and $395 million (including $84 million of stock-based compensation ) of costs associated with internal-use software and websitedevelopment. Amortizat
ion of previously capitalized amounts was $635 million , $634 million , and $545 million for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . General and Administrative
The 
increase in general and administ rative costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the compar able prior year periods, is primarily due toincreases in payroll and 
related expenses and professional service fees.28

Table of ContentsOther Operating Expense, Net
Other operating expense, net was 
$171 million , $167 million , and $214 million during 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , and was primarily rela ted to theamortization of int
angible assets.Interest Income and Expense
Our interest income was 
$50 million , $100 million , and $202 million during 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . We generally invest our excess cash in investmentgrade short- to interm
ediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance ofinvested funds based on the preva
iling rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was 
$459 million , $484 million , and $848 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The increase is primarily due to inc reases in our capital andfinance lease arrangements and
 long-term debt.Our long-term debt was 
$7.7 billion and $24.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . Our other long-term liab ilities were $12.6 billion and $21.0 billionas of 
December 31, 2016 and 2017 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan cial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Note 6—Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional
 information.Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t was $(256) million , $90 million , and $346 million during 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The primary component of oth er income(expense), net is rela
ted to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation.Income Taxes
Our effective tax ra
te is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix ofjurisdictions to which they r
elate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, changes in ourstock price, foreign cur
rency gains (losses), tax law developments (including changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relativechanges of expenses or losses for whi
ch tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For exampl
e, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.The 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on Decembe
r 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,lowering the statutory corpo
rate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreignsubsidiaries as of 2017, introduc
ing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The 2017 Tax Act also enhanced and extendedthrough 2026 the option to claim 
accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. We have not completed our determination of the accountingimplications of the 2017 Tax Ac
t on our tax accruals. However, we have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts inour financial state
ments as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act of approximately $789 million. Thisamount is primarily comprise
d of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate taxrate to 21% from 35%, af
ter taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-timetax is not material. As we co
mplete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S.Treasury Department, the 
IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impactour provision for income tax
es in the period in which the adjustments are made.We recorded a provision fo
r income taxes of $950 million , $1.4 billion , and $769 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Our provision for income taxes in 2016was higher than in 2015 primari
ly due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we mayrealize a tax bene
fit, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses. We have recorded valuation allowancesagainst the deferred 
tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the provisionalfavorable effect o
f the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-relateddevelopments.
We regularly assess whethe
r it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. Inperforming this assessmen
t with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. InQ2 2017, we
29

ted charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.We have tax benefits relating
 to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce ourU.S. taxable income. The 2017 Tax Act enhan
ced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. As ofDecember 31, 2017 
, our federal net opera ting loss carryforward was approximately $226 million and we had approximately $855 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset
 future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit.See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan
cial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Income Taxes” for additional information.Equity-Method Investment A
ctivity, Net of TaxEquity-method investment 
activity, net of tax, was $(22) million , $(96) million , and $(4) million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The primary components of this activity during 2015, 2016, and 2017 wer
e our equity-method investment losses during the periods and impairments recorded in 2016.Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measur
es, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our me
asures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet thedefinition of non-GAAP financial m
easures.We provide multiple m
easures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property andequipment with cash and through c
apital and finance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidatedstatements of cash flows to 
reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million in 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is cash flow from op

and equipment incentives,” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cashflow to the most comparabl

lows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residualcash flow available for d
iscretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representingprincipal reductions of d

•
Net sales are expected to be between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion, or to grow between 34% and 42% compared with first quarter 2017. This guidanceanticipates a favor
able impact of approximately $1.2 billion or 330 basis points from foreign exchange rates.•
Operating income is expected to be between $300 million and $1.0 billion, compared with $1.0 billion in first quarter 2017.•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.32

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market ri
sk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.Information relat
ing to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Resul
ts of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk fo
r changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried atamortized cost and flu
ctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at afixed rate, will gener
ally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing ratesof interest. All of o
ur cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value onour consolidated balance
 sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-ratedmoney market funds. 
Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses inprincipal if forced to sell 
securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides in

and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 . Foreign Exchange Risk
During 
2017 , net sales from our Inte rnational segment accounted for 30% of our consolidated revenues. Ne t sales and related expenses generated from ourinternationally-fo
cused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are inc luded in our North America segment), are primarilydenominated in the funct
ional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operationsof, and certain of our int
ercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.Upon consolidation, as foreign exch
ange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significantgains or losses on the remeasu
rement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period comparedto rates in effect 
the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $137 million in comparison with the prior y ear.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance offoreign funds as of 
December 31, 2017 , of $11.1 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of$555 million, $1.1 billion, and $2.2 bil
lion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated othercomprehensive loss,” a sepa
rate component of stockholders’ equity.We have foreign exchange 
risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as ofDecember 31, 2017 
, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $280 million, $600 million, and $1.3 billion,recorded to “Other incom
e (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Man

As of 
December 31, 2017 , our recorded value in equi ty and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $737 million. We record ourequity and equity warrant inv
estments in publicly traded companies at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility, and represents $415 million of ourinvestments as of 
December 31, 2017 . We evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events andcircumstances indic
ate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recentoperating results and tre
nds, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate providesadditional uncertain
ty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe thatmarket sensitivities are not 
practicable.34

companying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related consolid atedstatements of operat
ions, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 and the related notes (collectively referred t
o as the ‘financial statements’). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,the consolidated financ
ial position of Amazon.com, Inc. at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the consolidated resul ts of its operations and its cash flows for eachof the three years in th
e period ended December 31, 2017 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a

ements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance withthe U.S. federal securiti
es laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1—DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS A
ND ACCOUNTING POLICIESDescription of Business
Amazon.com opened its virtua
l doors on the World Wide Web in July 1995. We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments,we serve our primary custom
er sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our retail websitesand physical stores and focus on se
lection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to selltheir products on our websites and 
their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, appdevelopers, and others to publish 
and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of globalcompute, storage, databas
e, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions,advertising, and co-branded 
credit cards.We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. See “Note 11—Segment Information.”Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amoun
ts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the expanded presentation of “Net cash providedby (used in) investing activ
ities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the allocation of stock-based compensation to “Other operating expense, net” inthe segment results within 
“Note 11 - Segment Information.” These revised segment results reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates theCompany’s business performance 
and manages its operations. In addition, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were reclassified from “Net cashprovided by (used in) financing 
activities” to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of theadoption of new accounting guidanc
e.Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have avariable interest 
and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities(collectively, the 
“Company”). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market,Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) h
ave been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities, revenu
es and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates areused for, but not
 limited to, determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortizationperiod of these elemen
ts, incentive discount offers, sales returns, vendor funding, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, income taxes, valuation andimpairment of invest
ments, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, collectability of receivables, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill,depreciable lives of p
roperty and equipment, internal-use software and website development costs, acquisition purchase price allocations, investments in equityinterests, and contingenc
ies. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is 
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common sh
ares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a netloss, stock awards are excluded 
from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.42

Table of ContentsThe following table shows the cal
culation of diluted shares (in millions):

luted earnings per share477  484  493 Revenue
We recognize revenue 
from product sales or services rendered when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,delivery has occurred or s
ervice has been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue arrangements withmultiple deliverab
les are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using estimated selling prices if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence orthird-party evidence of the
 selling prices of the deliverables. We allocate the arrangement price to each of the elements based on the relative selling prices of eachelement. Estimated selling price
s are management’s best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elementsseparately and include 
considerations of customer demand, prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables, and the price if largely based on the cost ofproducing the product or servi
ce.Sales of certain of our dig
ital devices are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, consisting of the device, undelivered software upgrades and/orundelivered non-software se
rvices such as cloud services. The revenue allocated to the device, which is the substantial portion of the total sale price, and relatedcosts are generally r
ecognized upon delivery. Revenue related to undelivered software upgrades and/or undelivered non-software services is deferred andrecognized generally on 
a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each ofthese devices.
Sales of Amazon Prime membe
rships are also considered arrangements with multiple deliverables, including shipping benefits, Prime Video, Prime Music,Prime Photos, and access to the Kindl
e Owners’ Lending Library. The revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on theestimated delivery o
f services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits arerecognized as cost of sal
es as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we update the method of determining the estimated selling prices ofeach element as well 
as the allocation of Prime membership fees.We evaluate whether i
t is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally,when we are primarily oblig
ated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but notall of these indicato
rs, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. We generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated anddo not have latitude in est
ablishing prices. Such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees, a percentage of seller revenues, per-unit activity fees, or somecombination thereof.
Product sales represent r
evenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Product salesand shipping revenues, net of promo
tional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers.Retail sales to custome
rs are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier or thecustomer. Amazon’s elec
tronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers.Service sales represen
t third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions,certain advertising s
ervices, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Service sales, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, are recognized whenservice has been rendered.
Return allowances, which reduce 
revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Allowance for returns was $153 million , $156 million, and 
$62 million as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Additions to the allowance were $1.3 billion , $1.5 billion , and $1.8 billion , and deductions to the allowance were 
$1.3 billion , $1.5 billion , and $1.9 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Revenue from product sales and s ervices rendered is recorded net of salesand consumption taxes. Additional
ly, we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers,such as percentage discounts o
ff current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similaroffers. Current discount off
ers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers,when accepted by our customers, 
are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using ourhistorical experience for similar i
nducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in “Total net sales.”43

Table of ContentsCost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily cons
ists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video andmusic, packaging supplies, sort
ation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are thetransportation servic
e provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale ofproducts to our customers. Paymen
t processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” onour consolidated statem
ents of operations.Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with ou
r vendors to receive funds for advertising services, cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, and volume rebates. Wegenerally consider amoun
ts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, andtherefore record thos
e amounts as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Vendor rebates are typically dependentupon reaching minimum purch
ase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. Whenvolume rebates can be r
easonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.When we receive direc
t reimbursements for costs incurred by us in advertising the vendor’s product or service, the amount we receive is recorded as anoffset to “Marketing” on ou
r consolidated statements of operations.Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs prim
arily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,customer service cen
ters, and physical stores, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, andpreparing customer orde
rs for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain sellertransactions; responding to 
inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also includeamounts paid to third part
ies that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.Marketing
Marketing costs primar
ily consist of targeted online advertising, payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, andtelevision advertising. 
We pay commissions to participants in our Associates program when their customer referrals result in product sales and classify such costsas “Marketing” on our consolid
ated statements of operations. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and otherthird parties.
Advertising and other promotion
al costs are expensed as incurred and were $3.8 billion , $5.0 billion , and $6.3 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Prepaid advertising costs were not sign
ificant as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . Technology and Content
Technology and content costs inc
lude payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products andservices, development, des
ign, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructurecosts. Infrastructure 
costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS,as well as these and other e
fforts. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to ourcustomers.
Technology and content costs ar
e expensed as incurred, except for certain costs relating to the development of internal-use software and websitedevelopment costs, including so
ftware used to upgrade and enhance our websites and applications supporting our business, which are capitalized and amortizedover 
two years . General and Administrative
General and administra
tive expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment, such as depreciation expense and rent;professional fees and li
tigation costs; and other general corporate costs for corporate functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal, and human resources,among others.

Table of ContentsStock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all sto
ck awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair valueof restricted stock uni
ts is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and the fair value of stock options isestimated on the date o
f grant using the Black-Scholes model. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using theaccelerated method. The estimated
 number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differfrom our current esti
mates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors whenestimating expected forfeitures,
 including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience.Other Operating Expense, Net
Other operating expen
se, net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, andexpenses related to leg
al settlements.Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), ne
t, consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of $(266) million , $21 million , and $247 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 
, equity warrant valuation g ains (losses) of $0 million , $67 million , and $109 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , and realized gains (loss es) on marketablesecurities sales of 
$(5) million , $(8) million , and $(7) million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Income Taxes
Income tax expense includ
es U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the“2017 Tax Act”) includes a mand
atory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for whichno U.S. deferred tax liabili
ty had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue toinvest most or all of thes
e earnings, as well as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additionaltaxes related to such a
mounts.Deferred income tax balances
 reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and arestated at enacted tax rates ex
pected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.Deferred tax assets are eval
uated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We considermany factors when assessing the 
likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.We utilize a two-step 
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax positionfor recognition by deter
mining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, includingresolution of related 
appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of beingrealized upon ultima
te settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodicadjustments and whic
h may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as th
e price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. To i
ncrease the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used tomeasure fair value:
Level 1 
—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2 
—Valuations based on observable inpu ts other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities inactive markets, quoted price
s for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable 
market data.Level 3 
—Valuations based on unobservable inpu ts reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by othermarket participan
ts. These valuations require significant judgment.45

Table of ContentsFor our cash, cash equivalents, or 
marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices inactive markets for identical asset
s or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or basedon quoted market prices of s
imilar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cashequivalents, or marketable 
securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . As part of entering into com
mercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As ofDecember 31, 2016 
and 2017 , these warrants had a fai r value of $223 million and $441 million , and are recorded within “Oth er assets” on our consolidatedbalance sheets. The rel
ated gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $0 million , $67 million , and $109 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . These assets are primarily classified a
s Level 2 assets.Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly 
liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.Inventories
Inventories, consisting of produ
cts available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost andnet realizable va
lue. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such asthrough sales to individual cus
tomers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.We provide Fulfillment by Am
azon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,regardless of whether ful
fillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.We also purchase electronic 
device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for ourproducts. During the normal cours
e of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements withcontract manufacturers and s
uppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreementsconsists of firm, non-canc
ellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incuradditional costs. We also h
ave firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts rece
ivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, sellers, and vendors. As ofDecember 31, 2016 
and 2017 , customer receivabl es, net, were $3.9 billion and $6.4 billion , seller receivabl es, net, were $661 million and $692 million , and vendor receivables, net, we
re $2.0 billion and $2.6 billion . Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which providesfunding to sellers prima
rily to procure inventory.We estimate losses on r
eceivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired andwritten-off when it is probab
le that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtfulaccounts was 
$189 million , $237 million , and $348 million as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Additions to the allowance were $289 million , $451million 
, and $626 million , and deductions to the allowanc e were $290 million , $403 million , and $515 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The allowance for loan losses related to our s
eller receivables was not material as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . Internal-Use Software and Website Development
Costs incurred to develop softwar
e for internal use and our websites are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software . Costsrelated to design or ma
intenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred. For the years ended 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we capitalized 
$642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation ), $511 million (including $94 million of stock-based compensation ), and $395 million 
(including $84 million of stock-based compensation ) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previouslycapitalized amounts was 
$635 million , $634 million , and $545 million for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are s
tated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as areduction in our costs. Property 
includes buildings and land that we own, along with46

Table of Contentsproperty we have acquired unde
r build-to-suit, finance, and capital lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures, heavy equipment,servers and networking equipmen
t, and internal-use software and website development. Depreciation is record ed on a straight-line basis over the estimated usefullives of the assets 
(generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining lif e of the underlying building, two years for assets such as interna l-use software, three years for our servers, 
five years for networking equipment, five years for furniture and fixtu res, and ten years for heavy equipment). Depre ciation expense is classifiedwithin the corresponding opera
ting expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations
We categorize leases at their incepti
on as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and otherincentives. We recogni
ze lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date ofrequired payments. Additiona
lly, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements arecapitalized at cost and amortized
 over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.We establish assets and
 liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in theconstruction of structur
al improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, weassess whether these arrang
ements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilitiesare accounted for as f
inance leases.We establish assets and
 liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Suchassets are depreciated over t
he lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.Goodwill
We evaluate goodwill for 
impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not berecoverable. In test
ing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value ofa reporting unit is less th
an its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-stepimpairment test. We test goo
dwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of thereporting units. If the f
air value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, asecond step is performe
d to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimatethe fair value of the 
reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operatingexpenses, based primarily on 
expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.We completed the requ
ired annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2017, and determined that goodwill is no timpaired as the fai
r value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no triggering events identified from the date of our assessmentthrough 
December 31, 2017 that would require an update to our annual impairment test. See “Note 4—Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.”Other Assets
Included in “Other assets” on ou
r consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of amortization; video andmusic content, net of am
ortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majorityof which are attributab
le to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; and equity warrant assets.Video and Music Content
We obtain video and music con
tent for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions, which include both fixed andvariable payment schedules
. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content isavailable for streaming, we
 recognize an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments aremade and we amortize th
e asset to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically rangesfrom 
one to five years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. Wealso develop original cont
ent. Capitalized production costs associated with our original content are limited by the amount of revenue we expect to earn, whichresults in a portion being
47

Table of Contentsexpensed as incurred. These c
apitalized costs are amortized to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customer streams in thefirst months after availability.
Investments
We generally invest our 
excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Suchinvestments are included i
n “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities areclassified as avail
able-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”Equity investments are a
ccounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but notcontrol, over an investee. Equ
ity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses asreported by equity-method 
investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity - method investment activity,net of tax” on our consolidat
ed statements of operations.Equity investments without re
adily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for usingthe cost method of account
ing and classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the cost method, investments are carried at cost and areadjusted only for other-th
an-temporary declines in fair value, certain distributions, and additional investments.Equity investments that
 have readily determinable fair values are classified as available-for-sale and are included in “Marketable securities” on ourconsolidated balance she
ets and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”We periodically eva
luate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists ofseveral qualitativ
e and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until aforecasted recovery o
ccurs. Additionally, we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell anyinvestment before recovery 
of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; impliedvalues from any recent tran
sactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments; du
ration and severity of the decline in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment.Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwi
ll, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of theassets might not be recove
rable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset, a significant ch
ange in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount ofan asset or group of assets may no
t be recoverable.For long-lived assets used in oper
ations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted,probability-weighted futu
re cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-livedassets are considered he
ld for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for salein its immediate cond
ition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value lesscosts to sell. Assets held for sa
le were not significant as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued expenses 
and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to unredeemed gift cards, leases and assetretirement obliga
tions, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.As of 
December 31, 2016 and 2017 , our liabilities for un redeemed gift cards was $2.4 billion and $3.0 billion . We reduce the liabi lity for a gift card whenredeemed by a customer. 
If a gift card is not redeemed, we recognize revenue when it expires or when the likelihood of its redemption becomes remote, generallytwo years 
from the date of issuance. Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is record
ed when payments are received in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.Unearned revenue primar
ily relates to prepayments of Amazon Prime memberships and AWS services. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on ourconsolidated balance she
ets was $499 million and $1.0 billion of 48

Table of Contentsunearned revenue as of 
December 31, 2016 and 2017 . The amortization of pr eviously unearned revenue was approximately $10.0 billion and $14.3 billion in 2016and 
2017 . Foreign Currency
We have internationa
lly-focused websites for Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, and theUnited Kingdom 
. Net sales generated from these websites, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated inlocal functional cur
rencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is generally the same as the local currency.Assets and liabilities of 
these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at averagerates prevailing throughou
t the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’equity, and in the “Foreign cur
rency effect on cash and cash equivalents,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses includingintercompany transac
tions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on ourconsolidated statemen
ts of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded a loss of $215 million in 2015and recorded gains of 
$62 million and $202 million in 2016 and 2017 . Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted
In July 2015, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) modifying the accounting for inventory.Under this ASU, the measurement prin
ciple for inventory changed from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU definesnet realizable va
lue as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.The ASU is applicable to inventory th
at is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2017 with no material impact to ourconsolidated financia
l statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to berecognized as a component o
f income tax expense rather than equity. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income taxexpense will increase vol
atility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awardsdepends on our stock price at th
e date the awards vest. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement ofcash flows and allows an entity to 
make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. We adopted thisASU in Q1 2017 by recording the cumulative i
mpact through an increase in retained earnings of $687 million , and we will continue to estim ate expectedforfeitures. Additional
ly, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 millionfor the year ended Decemb
er 31, 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU amending revenue recogni
tion guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financialstatements to understand 
the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We will adopt this ASU onJanuary 1, 2018 with a cumulative 
adjustment that will increase retained earnings by approximately $650 million rather than retrospe ctively adjusting priorperiods. The cumulative
 adjustment will primarily relate to unredeemed gift cards. We will begin to recognize revenue from estimated unredeemed gift cards overthe expected customer 
redemption period, which is substantially within nine months, rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood ofredemption becomes remote, 
generally two years from the date of issuance. Other changes relate to Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers,which will be recognized upon sal
e to the retailer rather than to end customers. We also will change how we recognize and classify Amazon Prime memberships,which are currently consid
ered arrangements with multiple deliverables that are allocated among products sales and service sales. Upon adoption of the ASU,Amazon Prime memberships wil
l be accounted for as a single performance obligation recognized ratably over the membership period and will be classified asservice sales. Other chang
es that we have identified relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services will be classified as revenue ratherthan a reduction in cost of s
ales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content will primarily be presented on a net basis.In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which updates certain 
aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.Under this ASU, certain equity invest
ments will be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. The ASU is effective for reporting periodsbeginning after Decembe
r 15, 2017. We do not expect adoption of the ASU in Q1 2018 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities foroperating leases with te
rms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within theconsolidated statemen
ts of operations and49

Table of Contentsconsolidated statemen
ts of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginningafter December 15, 2018, with e
arly adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this ASU beginning in Q1 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact and expect theASU will have a material imp
act on our consolidated financial statements, primarily to the consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures.In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the account
ing for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income taxconsequences of an interco
mpany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the incometax effects will cont
inue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,2017, with early adoption permi
tted. We will adopt this ASU beginning in Q1 2018. We estimate the ASU will have an impact of approximately $250 million on our consolidated financial
 statements, including retained earnings and deferred taxes. This estimate takes into account valuation allowances that we anticipaterecording against cer
tain material deferred tax assets. Any change in our assessment of the likelihood of our ability to realize deferred tax assets will be reflected asan income tax benefit du
ring the quarter of such change.In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the present
ation of restricted cash within the statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires thatrestricted cash be in
cluded within cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective retrospectively for reporting periods beginningafter December 15, 2017, with e
arly adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU beginning in Q1 2018.Note 2—CASH, CAS

l leases of $2.7 billion , $3.8 billion , and $5.4 billion for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Gross assets recorded under cap ital leases were $17.0 billion 
and $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . Accumulated deprecia tion associated with capital leases was $8.5 billion and $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2016 
and 2017 . We capitalize construction in 
progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered the owner,for accounting purposes, during th
e construction period. For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do notqualify for sales recogn
ition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings. This isprincipally due to our signi
ficant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or therelated leases’ t
erms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, the long-termconstruction obligations a
re considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months recorded as “Accrued expenses andother.” Gross assets remain
ing under finance leases were $2.9 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . Accumulated deprecia tion associatedwith finance leases was 
$361 million and $635 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . Note 4—ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED I
NTANGIBLE ASSETSAcquisition Activity
During 
2015 and 2016 , we acquired certain co mpanies for an aggregate purchase price of $690 million and $103 million . The primary reason for th eseacquisitions, none of which were ind
ividually material to our consolidated financial statements, was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon toserve customers more effectively.
On 
May 12, 2017 , we acquired Souq Group Ltd. (“Souq”), an e-co mmerce company, for approximately $583 million , net of cash acquired, and on August 28, 2017, we acquired Whole Foods Market, a g
rocery store chain, for approximately $13.2 billion , net of cash acquired. Both acqu isitions are intended to expandour retail presence. Dur
ing 2017 , we also acquired certai n other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $204 million . The primary reason for our o ther2017 
acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.Acquisition-related cos
ts were expensed as incurred and were not significant. The valuation of certain assets and liabilities in the Whole Foods Marketacquisition is prelim

Intangible assets acquired in 2015 , 2016 , and the other 2017 acquisitions have estim ated useful lives of between one and six years, one and seven years, and one 
and seven years, with weighted-averag e amortization periods of five years, five years, and four years. Acquired intangible assets for Whole Foods Markethave estimated useful 
lives of between one and twenty-five years, with a weighted-aver age amortization period of twenty-three years, primarily driv en by theWhole Foods Market trade nam
e.The fair value of assumed s
tock options, estimated using the Black-Scholes model, and restricted stock units of $9 million , $0 million , and $0 million for 2015 
, 2016 , and 2017 will be expensed o ver the remaining service period. We determined the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquiredprimarily by using the inco
me approach. These assets are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to operatingexpenses on a straight-lin
e basis over their estimated useful lives.53

During

In 2016, we determined that we pro
cessed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by theIran Threat Reduction and Syri
a Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, othermedia, apparel, home and k
itchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Ourreview is ongoing and we have voluntar
ily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United StatesDepartment of Commerce
’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS59

Table of Contentswith respect to their r
eview, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information — DisclosurePursuant to Section 13(r) of the Ex
change Act.”We are subject to cl
aims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions inwhich we already collect 
and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significantadditional tax liabi
lities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period fromJanuary 2016 to March 2016, including in
terest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by ourthird-party sellers. 
We believe the assessment is without merit. If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similarnature, we could be subject to s
ignificant additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from tim
e to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:In November 2007, an Austrian copyright 
collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.àr.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logist
ik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germanyseeking to collect a t
ariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed theGerman case pending a fina
l decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales ofproducts to which the tarif
f potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana’s claim and in September 2010 commenced anappeal in the Commerci
al Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, theAustrian Supreme Court refer
red the case to the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of thetariff where cert
ain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian SupremeCourt referred the cas
e back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditionsset by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercia
l Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissedAustro-Mechana’s claims. 
In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the HigherCommercial Court of Vienna con
firmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana’s appeal. InFebruary 2016, Austro-Mechana appea
led that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and referred 
the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. A number of additional actions have been filed making similarallegations. In Decembe
r 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte (“ZPU”), filed a complaint against AmazonEU S.à r.l., Amazon Media EU S.à r.l., Amazon Servic
es Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, andAmazon Eurasia Holdings S.à r.l. in the Dis
trict Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website tocustomers located in Ger
many. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.à r.l. in the Court ofFirst Instance of Brussels, Belgiu
m, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. InNovember 2013, the Belgian court ru
led in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for adetermination of dam
ages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.Beginning in August 2013, a number of compla
ints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed tocompensate hourly workers for 
time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, In
c. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v.Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com Inc., ano
ther affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the WesternDistrict of Kentucky. In Septemb
er 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for theWestern District of W
ashington, and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Kentu
cky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in theUnited States District Court fo
r the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and formeremployees under the Fair Labo
r Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California,Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Wash
ington, and Nevada, and one complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. Thecomplaints seek an unspeci
fied amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that 
time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage andhour statute. In February 2015, the 
courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. InMarch 2016, the United States

In 
2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $950 million , $1.4 billion , and $769 million . We have tax benefits r elating to excess stock-based compensation deductions 
and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds,were 
$273 million , $412 million , and $957 million for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on Decembe
r 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,lowering the statutory corpo
rate tax rate from 35% to 21% , eliminating certain deductio ns, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreignsubsidiaries, introducing new t
ax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The 2017 Tax Act also enhanced and extended through 2026the option to claim ac
celerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. We have not completed our determination of the accounting implications of the 2017Tax Act on our tax accruals. However, we h
ave reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statementsas of December 31, 2017. We reco
rded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act of approximately $789 million . This amount is primarily comprised of the remeasurement
 of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% 
, after taking into ac count the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax is notmaterial. As we complet
e our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. TreasuryDepartment, the IRS, and other st
andard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact ourprovision for income taxes 
in the period in which the adjustments are made.64

$1.3 billion of excess tax benefits f rom stock-based compensation.Our provision for income taxes 
in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in theproportion of foreign losses fo

Table of ContentsTax Contingencies
We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our taxpositions and determining our p
rovision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which theultimate tax determination is u
ncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxeswill be due. These reserves a
re established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fullysupportable. We adjust thes
e reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes theimpact of reserve prov
isions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.The reconciliation of ou

As of December 31, 2017 , we had $2.3 billion of accrued tax contingen cies, of which $1.2 billion , if fully recognized, would de crease our effective tax rate.As of 
December 31, 2016 and 2017 , we had accrued intere st and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $67 million and $107 million 
. Interest and penalti es, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 was $18 million , $9million 
, and $40 million . We are under examina
tion, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2005 and thereafter. These examinations may lead 
to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination aswell as subsequent periods. As previously d
isclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the2005 and 2006 calendar years re
lating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount thatwould result in additional f
ederal tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On Mar ch 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding theissues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejec
ted the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for thetransactions undertaken wi
th our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice ofappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for th
e Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversedon appeal or if the IRS were to suc
cessfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could besubject to significant ad
ditional tax liabilities.Certain of our subsidiaries we
re under examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (“FTA”) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter. In September 2012, we received propos
ed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreignjurisdictions. In June 2015, we rec
eived final tax collection notices for these years assessing additional French taxes, interest, and penalties through September2012. In December 2017, we settled th
is dispute with the FTA and included the impact thereof within our financial statements. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a form
al investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income taxpaid by certain of our subsidi
aries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announc ed its decision thatdeterminations by the t
ax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate andrecover additional t
axes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options,including an appeal. In Dece
mber 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimatedrecovery amount of approxi
mately  €250 million , plus interest, the actu al amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg taxauthorities in accord
ance with the European Commission’s guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, includinginterest, into escrow, where 
it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimatedrecovery amount announced by th
e European Commission. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including Canada,China, Germany, India, Japan,
67

Table of ContentsLuxembourg, and the United Kingdom. 
 We are under, or may be subj ect to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respectof these particular jurisdictio
ns primarily for 2008 and thereafter. We expect the total 
amount of tax contingencies will grow in 2018 . In addition, changes in stat e, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our taxcontingencies. The timing o
f the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issuesraised by the taxing author
ities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additionalassessments by various tax autho
rities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements couldresult in changes to our cont
ingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2017 . The actual amount of any ch ange could vary significantlydepending on the ultimate 
timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.Note 11—SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our oper
ations into three segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses“Fulfillment,” “Mark
eting,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which thecosts are incurred. The m

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an eva
luation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of ourprincipal executive o
fficer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined inRule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of 
December 31, 2017 . Based on this  evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,as of 
December 31, 2017 , our disclosure controls and pro cedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us inthe reports that we fil
e or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules andforms and to provide
 reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officerand principal financial officer,
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act.Management has assessed the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria est ablished in InternalControl—Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment,management concluded th
at, as of December 31, 2017 , our internal control ove r financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Ernst & Young has independently assessed 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our int
ernal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that materially affected, or are reaso nablylikely to materially affect, our i
nternal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and proc
edures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving theirobjectives as specifi
ed above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reportingwill prevent or detect 
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide onlyreasonable, not absolute, assu
rance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to erroror fraud will not occur or th
at all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.73

Opinion on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Amazon.com, 
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,Amazon.com, Inc. maintai
ned, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidatedbalance sheets of Amazon.co
m, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related cons olidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,stockholders’ equity, and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 of Amazon.com, Inc. and our repor t dated February 1, 2018 expressed an unqualified opin
ion thereon.Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal control over 
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andrequired to be independent wi
th respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and ope
rating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessaryin the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal c
ontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of f
inancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP
