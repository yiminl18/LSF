NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
A. Basis of Presentation
We prepared these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our
2022 Form 10-K. As permitted under the SEC requirements for interim reporting, certain footnotes or other financial information have been condensed or
omitted.
These financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair statement of results for the interim periods
presented. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
included in our 2022 Form 10-K. Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these
interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year.
Pfizer’s fiscal quarter-end for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is as of and for the three and six months ended May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, and for
U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022.
We manage our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the
only reportable segment. See Note 13A below and Note 17A in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Business development activities impacted financial results in the periods presented. In March 2023, we and Seagen announced that the companies entered into
an agreement under which we will acquire Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer
medicines, for $229 in cash per Seagen share for a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion. We expect to finance the transaction substantially
through $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023 (see Note 7D), and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. The
transaction was approved by Seagen’s shareholders in May 2023. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to
customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. See Note 2 below, as well as Notes 1A and 2 in our 2022 Form 10-K.
We have made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior-period amounts to the current presentation for segment reporting.
B. New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023
On January 1, 2023, we adopted a new accounting standard for supplier finance programs which requires increased disclosures in the notes to our financial
statements. See Note 8C.
In the second quarter of 2023, we adopted new accounting standards on reference rate reform that provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the
guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate that were discontinued after June 30, 2023.
We applied certain of the optional expedients related to hedge accounting relationships. The main purpose of the expedients is to allow hedge accounting to
continue uninterrupted and make it easier to apply the requirements to maintain hedge accounting during the transition period through December 31, 2024.
C. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable
Customers––Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to
retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. We principally sell Paxlovid to government agencies and distributors. In the U.S., we
primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government (including the CDC), wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated
delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions.
Deductions from Revenues––Our accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales
allowances and sales returns and cash discounts are as follows:

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Trade Accounts Receivable––Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of
expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic
conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S.
versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages
are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.
In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and
customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. When
management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded.
During the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer
receivables were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable, see Note 1G in
our 2022 Form 10-K.
Note 2. Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations, Equity-Method Investment and Research and Development Arrangement
A. Acquisitions
GBT––On October 5, 2022, we acquired GBT, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing treatments
for underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $5.7 billion ($5.2 billion, net of
cash acquired). In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $4.4 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $3.0
billion of IPR&D and $1.4 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of six years, (ii) $1.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $672 million of inventories to
be sold over approximately three years, (iv) $568 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (v) $331 million of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in
the fourth quarter of 2022. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.
Biohaven––On October 3, 2022, we acquired Biohaven, the maker of Nurtec ODT/Vydura (rimegepant), an innovative therapy approved for both acute
treatment of migraine and prevention of episodic migraine in adults. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.8 billion, which includes the
fair value of Pfizer’s previous investment in Biohaven on the acquisition date of approximately $300 million. In connection with this business combination, we
provisionally recorded: (i) $12.1 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $11.6 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of 11 years
and $450 million of IPR&D, (ii) $813 million of inventories to be sold over approximately two years, (iii) $795 million of Goodwill, (iv) $398 million of trade
accounts receivable, (v) $1.4 billion of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022, (vi) $566 million of net deferred tax
liabilities and (vii) $476 million of Other current liabilities. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not
yet been finalized.
Arena––On March 11, 2022, we acquired Arena, a clinical stage company with development-stage therapeutic candidates in gastroenterology, dermatology and
cardiology. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $6.6 billion ($6.2 billion, net of cash acquired). The final allocation of the consideration
transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in the first quarter of 2023. In connection with this business combination, we
recorded: (i) $5.5 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $5.0 billion of IPR&D and $460 million of indefinite-lived licensing agreements and
other, (ii) $1.0 billion of Goodwill and (iii) $490 million of net deferred tax liabilities.
B. Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations––net of tax in the periods presented relate to post-close adjustments for previously divested businesses. In the three and six months
ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022, amounts recorded under interim agreements, including TSAs and MSAs, associated with these disposals were not
material. Under agreements related to the 2020 spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris, net amounts due to Viatris
were $25 million as of July 2, 2023 and $94 million as of December 31, 2022. The cash flows associated with the agreements are included in Net cash provided
by/(used in) operating activities. For information about the nature of these agreements, see Note 2B in our 2022 Form 10-K.
C. Equity-Method Investment
Haleon/Consumer Healthcare JV––On July 18, 2022, GSK completed a demerger of the Consumer Healthcare JV which became Haleon, an independent,
publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange that holds the joint historical
11
PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
consumer healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of the ordinary shares of Haleon after the demerger.
The carrying value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022 is $11.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, and is reported
in Equity-method investments. The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $12.1 billion.
Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into
U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income.
The increase in the value of our investment from December 31, 2022 is primarily due to $271 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see
Note 6) and our share of Haleon’s earnings of $219 million, partially offset by $88 million in dividends received. We record our share of earnings from
Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net. Our total share of Haleon’s earnings
generated in the first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2023, was $151 million. Our total share of Haleon’s
earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2023, was $219
million. Our total share of the JV’s earnings generated in the first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2022,
was $150 million. Our total share of the JV’s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating
results in the first six months of 2022, was $335 million. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair
value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is included in Other
(income)/deductions—net and was not material to our results of operations in the periods presented. See Note 4.
Summarized financial information for our equity-method investee, Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV, for the three and six months ending March 31,
2023, the most recent period available, and for the three and six months ending March 31, 2022, is as follows:

Income attributable to shareholders 473 468 684 1,046 
D. Research and Development Arrangement
Research and Development Funding Arrangement with Blackstone––In April 2023, we entered into an arrangement with Blackstone under which we will
receive up to a total of $550 million in 2023 through 2026 to co-fund our quarterly development costs for specified treatments. As there is substantive transfer
of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We are recognizing the funding as
a reduction of Research and development expenses using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses. The reduction to Research and
development expenses for the second quarter of 2023 was $45 million. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU
for the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $468 million
contingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to
Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product. Following potential regulatory
approval, Blackstone will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to $550 million in total based on achievement of certain levels
of cumulative applicable net sales, as well as royalties based on a mid-to-high single digit percentage of the applicable net sales. Fixed sales-based milestone
payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated
commercial life of the product, and royalties on net sales will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred.

Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
A. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program
In 2019, we announced that we would be incurring costs associated with our Transforming to a More Focused Company Program, a multi-year effort to ensure
our cost base aligns appropriately with our operating structure following Pfizer’s transformation into a more focused, innovative science-based global
biopharmaceutical business. This program includes activities to (i) restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our operating structure;
(ii) transform our commercial go-to-market model; and (iii) optimize our manufacturing network and R&D operations.
The activities associated with transforming our commercial go-to-market model are substantially complete. Activities associated with restructuring our
corporate enabling functions and optimizing our manufacturing network and R&D operations are ongoing and are expected to be substantially completed by
the end of 2023. The costs to restructure our corporate enabling functions, and to optimize our R&D operations and reduce cycle times, as well as to further
prioritize our internal R&D portfolio, primarily include severance and implementation costs. The costs to optimize our manufacturing network largely include
severance, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, and accelerated depreciation.
From the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through July 2, 2023, we incurred costs of $3.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion ($1.1 billion of
restructuring charges) is associated with Biopharma. We have incurred approximately 85% of total expected costs to date, and we expect the remaining costs to
be substantially incurred through 2023.

qualifying costs. In the six months ended July 2, 2023, integration costs and other were mostly related to our acquisitions of GBT and Biohaven. In the six months ended July 3, 2022, integration
costs and other were mostly related to our acquisition of Arena, including $138 million in payments to Arena employees in the first quarter of 2022 for the fair value of previously unvested long-
term incentive awards that was recognized as post-closing compensation expense.

The decrease in net interest expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 reflects higher interest expense driven by our $31 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured
notes issued in May 2023 as part of the financing for our proposed acquisition of Seagen, which was more than offset by higher interest income on the investment of the net proceeds from the debt
issuance.
The net gains in the second quarter of 2023 include, among other things, unrealized gains of $202 million related to our investment in Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel). The net losses
in the first six months of 2023 include, among other things, unrealized losses of $276 million related to our investment in BioNTech. The net losses in 2022 included, among other things, unrealized
losses of $432 million in the second quarter and $776 million in the first six months related to our investments in BioNTech and Cerevel.
The second quarter and first six months of 2023 primarily include certain product liability and other legal expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer. The second quarter
and first six months of 2022 primarily included certain product liability expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer. The first six months of 2022 also included legal
obligations related to pre-acquisition commitments.
The first six months of 2023 primarily represents intangible asset impairment charges, including $128 million associated with Other business activities, related to IPR&D and developed technology
rights for acquired software assets and reflects unfavorable pivotal trial results and updated commercial forecasts, and $120 million associated with our Biopharma segment resulting from the
discontinuation of a study related to an out-licensed IPR&D asset for the treatment of prostate cancer, acquired in our Array BioPharma Inc. acquisition.
See Note 2C.
The first six months of 2023 primarily includes, among other things, dividend income of $211 million from our investment in Nimbus resulting from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited’s
acquisition of Nimbus’s oral, selective allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor program subsidiary, and $183 million from our investment in ViiV.(a)

Reflects intangible assets written down to fair value in 2023. Fair value was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the
discounted cash flow method. We started with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some
of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal
and/or regulatory forces on the product; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic
diversity of the projected cash flows.
Note 5. Tax Matters
A. Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was (3.1)% for the second quarter of 2023, compared to 13.7% for the second quarter of 2022, and was 7.5%
for the first six months of 2023, compared to 13.4% for the first six months of 2022. The negative effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 and the
lower effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of 2023, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2022, were primarily due to
tax benefits in the second quarter of 2023 related to global income tax resolutions in multiple jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years and a favorable change
in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
We elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on
accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The fifth annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 18, 2023 due date.
The sixth annual installment is due April 15, 2024 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of July 2, 2023. The remaining liability is reported in
noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign
tax and other credit carryforwards.
B. Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes.
All of our tax positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations
and judgments and the resolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.
The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to Pfizer, tax years 2016-2018 are under audit. Tax years
2019-2023 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain
related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions dating back to 2012.

E. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
Foreign Exchange Risk––A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange
rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial
instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another
currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.
The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. Pound, Japanese Yen, Chinese renminbi, Singapore dollar and
Canadian dollar, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to two years. We may seek to
protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.
Interest Rate Risk––Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the
profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to
changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial
instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.

condensed consolidated statements of income. OCI = Other comprehensive income/(loss), included in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
The amounts reclassified from OCI into COS were:
•a net gain of $55 million in the second quarter of 2023;
•a net gain of $146 million in the first six months of 2023;
•a net gain of $68 million in the second quarter of 2022; and
•a net gain of $102 million in the first six months of 2022.
The remaining amounts were reclassified from OCI into OID. Based on quarter-end foreign exchange rates that are subject to change, we expect to reclassify a pre-tax gain of $208 million within
the next 12 months into income. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future foreign exchange cash flows is approximately 20 years and relates
to foreign currency debt.
The amounts reclassified from OCI were reclassified into OID.
Short-term borrowings and long-term debt include foreign currency borrowings, which are used in net investment hedges. The related long-term debt carrying values as of July 2, 2023 and

F. Credit Risk
A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade accounts
receivables with significant customers, see Note 13C below and Note 17C in our 2022 Form 10-K.
As of July 2, 2023, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio consist primarily of money market funds mainly invested in U.S. Treasury and government
debt, as well as sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S., Germany, Canada, Japan, and France.
With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any
counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support
annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant
concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of July 2, 2023, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that
are in a net payable position was $854 million, for which we have posted collateral of $867 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term
investments. As of July 2, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $422 million, for which
we have received collateral of $366 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.

B. Other Current Liabilities
Other current liabilities includes, among other things, amounts payable to BioNTech for the gross profit split for Comirnaty, which totaled $1.3 billion as of
July 2, 2023 and $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2022.
C. Supplier Finance Program Obligation
We maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating financial institutions. Under these agreements, participating suppliers may
voluntarily elect to sell their accounts receivable with Pfizer to these financial institutions. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the
respective financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate and we pay
the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the original maturity dates, which is generally within 90 to 120 days of the invoice date.
The agreements with the financial institutions do not require Pfizer to provide assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees for the supplier finance
program. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within trade payables in our consolidated
balance sheet. As of July 2, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, $779 million and $849 million of our trade payables to suppliers who participate in
these financing arrangements are outstanding.

The increase in the gross carrying amount includes, among other things, $495 million of capitalized milestones and the transfer of $450 million from IPR&D to developed technology rights as a
result of the approval in the U.S. for Zavzpret nasal spray, and a $90 million capitalized milestone as a result of the approval of Ngenla in the U.S. (all in the second quarter of 2023).
The decrease in the gross carrying amount mainly reflects the transfer from IPR&D to developed technology rights as a result of the approval in the U.S. of Zavzpret nasal spray.
The decrease is primarily due to amortization expense of $2.3 billion and impairments of $248 million (see Note 4), partially offset by additions of $681 million mostly related to milestone
payments for the approvals in the U.S. for Zavzpret nasal spray and Ngenla.(b)

Note 12. Contingencies and Certain Commitments
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies,
guarantees and indemnifications. The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies,
see Note 5B.
A. Legal Proceedings
Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse
outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets.
We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.
•Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion,
securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and
reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.
•Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-
related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.
•Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies
in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.
Certain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could
be substantial, and/or criminal charges.
We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts
do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter
into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our
cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.(a)
(a)
25
PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of
reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate,
and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.
Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely
heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure
threshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both
quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our
view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the
likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to
multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would
be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of
all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In
addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the
patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts
accrued is remote.
A1. Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation
We are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including
but not limited to, those discussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our
collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are
invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging
that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In
addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners
are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-
U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In
November 2022, BMS received permission to appeal the High Court’s decision and the appeal hearing was held in April 2023. In May 2023, the Court of
Appeal dismissed the appeal. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement
action against BioNTech and certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents
and certain expired and unexpired European patents. Additional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other
jurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also party to patent
damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for
allegedly causing delay of generic entry.
We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, as well as court proceedings relating to our intellectual property or the
intellectual property rights of others, including challenges to such rights initiated by us. For example, we have challenged certain of GSK’s RSV vaccine
patents in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our collaboration/licensing partner’s patents) is found to be invalid by such
proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several
of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional
competitor vaccines, if approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a
competitor’s vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.
We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged
infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a
26
PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such
third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be
enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.
Actions In Which We Are The Plaintiff
Xeljanz (tofacitinib)
Beginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate abbreviated new drug applications
(ANDAs) with the FDA seeking approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both
immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have settled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining actions continue
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.
In October 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics Inc. (Sinotherapeutics) asserting the infringement and validity of
our patent covering extended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Sinotherapeutics in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic
version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets. In November 2022, we filed an additional patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics relating to
its challenge of our extended release formulation and method of treatment patents in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 22
mg extended release tablets.
In June 2023, we brought a patent infringement action against Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. (collectively, Aurobindo) asserting
the infringement and validity of our basic compound patent, in connection with Aurobindo’s ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib
11 mg extended release tablets. Also in June 2023, we brought a patent infringement action against Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun) asserting the infringement and validity of our basic compound patent, in connection with Sun’s ANDA
seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg immediate release tablets. Also in June 2023, we brought a patent infringement
action against Annora Pharma Private Limited (Annora) and Hetero USA, Inc. (Hetero) asserting the infringement and validity of our basic compound patent,
in connection with Annora’s ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 1 mg/mL oral solution.
Ibrance (palbociclib)
Beginning in January 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of
Ibrance tablets. We have settled with one of these generic companies on terms not material to us, and have dismissed the patent infringement actions against all
other generic companies except for the action against Synthon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and affiliated entities, in which we have asserted the infringement and
validity of the composition of matter patent, expiring in 2027.
Eucrisa
Beginning in September 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of
Eucrisa. The companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of a composition of matter patent expiring in 2026, two method of use patents expiring in
2027, and one other method of use patent expiring in 2030. In September 2021, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents challenged by the generic companies. In July 2023, we reached
a settlement agreement with one generic company on terms not material to the company.
Mektovi (binimetinib)
Beginning in August 2022, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of
Mektovi. The companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of two method of use patents expiring in 2030, a method of use patent expiring in 2031,
two method of use patents expiring in 2033, and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. Beginning in September 2022, we brought patent infringement
actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of all six patents.
In August 2022 we received notice from Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Teva) that it had filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Mektovi.
Teva asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of two method of use patents expiring in 2033 and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. In June 2023,
we brought a patent infringement action against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the three
patents.

Actions in Which We are the Defendant
Comirnaty
In March 2022, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alnylam) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer and Pharmacia
& Upjohn Company LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, alleging that Comirnaty infringes a U.S. patent issued in February 2022, and seeking unspecified
monetary damages. In July 2022, Alnylam filed a second complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer, Pharmacia & Upjohn
Company LLC, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, alleging that Comirnaty infringes a U.S. patent issued in July 2022, and seeking unspecified
monetary damages. In May 2023, Alnylam filed a separate complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer and Pharmacia &
Upjohn Company LLC alleging that Comirnaty infringes four U.S. patents issued on various dates in 2023 and seeking unspecified monetary damages.
In August 2022, ModernaTX, Inc. (ModernaTX) and Moderna US, Inc. (Moderna) sued Pfizer, BioNTech, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH and BioNTech US
Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Comirnaty infringes three U.S. patents. In its complaint, Moderna stated that it is
seeking damages for alleged infringement occurring after March 7, 2022.
In August 2022, ModernaTX filed a patent infringement action in Germany against Pfizer and certain subsidiary companies, as well as BioNTech and certain
subsidiary companies, alleging that Comirnaty infringes two European patents. In September 2022, ModernaTX filed patent infringement actions in the U.K.
and in the Netherlands against Pfizer and certain subsidiary companies, as well as BioNTech and certain subsidiary companies, on the same two patents. In its
complaints, ModernaTX stated that it is seeking damages for alleged infringement occurring after March 7, 2022. In the U.K., Pfizer and BioNTech have
brought an action against ModernaTX seeking to revoke these European patents, which was consolidated with the September 2022 action filed by ModernaTX.
ModernaTX has filed additional patent infringement actions against Pfizer and BioNTech in certain other ex-U.S. jurisdictions.
In April 2023, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Arbutus) and Genevant Sciences GmbH (Genevant) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District
of New Jersey against Pfizer and BioNTech alleging that Comirnaty and its manufacture infringe five U.S. patents, and seeking unspecified monetary damages.
In June 2023, Promosome LLC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against Pfizer and BioNTech alleging that
Comirnaty and its manufacture infringe a U.S. patent and seeking unspecified monetary damages.
Paxlovid
In June 2022, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Pfizer alleging that the active
ingredient in Paxlovid, nirmatrelvir, infringes a U.S. patent issued in June 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages.
Abrysvo
In August 2023, GlaxoSmithKline Biologics SA and GlaxoSmithKline LLC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against
Pfizer alleging that the active ingredient in Abrysvo infringes four U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and a permanent
injunction against sales of Abrysvo for use in adults over 60 years of age.
Matters Involving Pfizer and its Collaboration/Licensing Partners
Comirnaty
In July 2022, Pfizer, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH filed a declaratory judgment complaint against CureVac in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Massachusetts seeking a judgment of non-infringement for three U.S. patents relating to Comirnaty. In May 2023, the case was transferred to the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Also in May 2023, CureVac asserted that Comirnaty infringes the three patents that were the subject of
our declaratory judgment complaint, and asserted that Comirnaty infringes six additional U.S. patents.
In the U.K., Pfizer and BioNTech have sued CureVac seeking a judgment of invalidity of several patents and CureVac has made certain infringement
counterclaims.
Xtandi (enzalutamide)
In July 2022, Medivation LLC and Medivation Prostate Therapeutics LLC (wholly owned subsidiaries of Pfizer); Astellas Pharma Inc., Astellas US LLC and

enzalutamide; and in March 2023, the same entities filed a patent-infringement suit in the same jurisdiction against Humanwell Puracap Pharmaceuticals
(Wuhan) Co., Ltd. and Epic Pharma, LLC in connection with their ANDA seeking approval to market generic versions of enzalutamide. In July 2023, we
settled our actions against Humanwell Puracap Pharmaceuticals (Wuhan) Co., Ltd. and Epic Pharma, LLC on terms not material to us. The generic
manufacturers are challenging the composition of matter patent, which expires in 2027, covering enzalutamide and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, for
treating prostate cancer.
Eliquis
In April 2023, we and BMS brought separate patent-infringement actions in Federal Court in Delaware against each of Biocon Pharma Ltd. (Biocon) and
ScieGen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ScieGen) asserting the infringement and validity of the formulation patent for Eliquis, expiring in 2031, challenged by Biocon
and ScieGen in their respective ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Eliquis. In April 2023, we settled our action against ScieGen on terms
not material to us. In June 2023, we settled our action against Biocon on terms not material to us.
A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
We are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these
cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective
devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain
liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking
damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain
of its previously owned subsidiaries.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or
formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.
Effexor
Beginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of
Wyeth and certain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek
to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase
of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The
plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain
of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing
certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic
drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class
in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of
these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.
In 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct
purchaser plaintiff claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct
purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.
Lipitor
Beginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in
most of the actions, Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent
nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the
purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants’ allegedly
unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/
29
PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain
patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and
(ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages
on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition,
individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that
are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.
In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court
dismissed with prejudice the claims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and
for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to
the District Court.
Also, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks
relief on behalf of the State of West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported
class actions described above.
EpiPen (Direct Purchaser)
In February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and
various Mylan entities, on behalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the
defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and Mylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent
litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged
overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the direct purchaser complaint, without prejudice. In
September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In August 2022, the District Court granted Pfizer’s motion to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiffs have
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
Nexium 24HR and Protonix
A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in
various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump
inhibitors. The cases against Pfizer involve Protonix and/or Nexium 24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages,
restitution or disgorgement. In 2017, the federal actions were ordered transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for
the District of New Jersey. As part of the combination of our and GSK’s consumer healthcare businesses to form Haleon, Haleon assumed, and agreed to
indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of such litigation to the extent related to Nexium 24HR. In June 2023, the parties reached an agreement to resolve
the litigation related to Protonix on terms not material to Pfizer.
Docetaxel
•Personal Injury Actions
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel
developed permanent hair loss. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product, Taxotere.
Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. Additional lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs allege they developed blocked tear ducts following
their treatment with Docetaxel.
In 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In
2022, the eye injury cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
•Mississippi Attorney General Government Action
In 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of the branded product and eight other
manufacturers including Pfizer and Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the
Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. The action seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.

A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an
increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that
have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. In 2006, Pfizer sold the
consumer business that included its Zantac OTC rights to Johnson & Johnson and transferred the assets and liabilities related to Zantac OTC to Johnson &
Johnson in connection with the sale. Plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida (the Federal MDL Court). Plaintiffs in the MDL have filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, asserting a
consolidated consumer class action alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring
complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. In December 2022, the Federal MDL Court granted defendants’ Daubert
motions to exclude plaintiffs’ expert testimony and motion for summary judgment on general causation, and dismissed the litigation.
In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive
damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants’ sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the
Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state courts, alleging various state statutory and
common law claims in connection with the defendants’ alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding
was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California
state court. Coordinated proceedings have also been created in other state courts.
Chantix
Beginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizer’s voluntary recall of
Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing
Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including
damages and medical monitoring. In December 2022, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.
A3. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other Matters
Monsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia
Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then
transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that
was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to
Pharmacia’s former agricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising
out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding
such claims and litigation.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses.
As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical
businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New
Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not
limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New Monsanto’s assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities
apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including,
without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are
defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, and have been
indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.

Environmental Matters
In 2009, as part of our acquisition of Wyeth, we assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the Wyeth Holdings LLC (formerly known as, Wyeth
Holdings Corporation and American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. Since that time, we have
executed or have become a party to a number of administrative settlement agreements, orders on consent, and/or judicial consent decrees, with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and/or New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to perform remedial design, removal and remedial actions, and
related environmental remediation activities at the Bound Brook facility. We have accrued for the currently estimated costs of these activities.
We are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended, and other state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health
In 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a
number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-
Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical
and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants’ motions to
dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs’ claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision. In February 2022, the defendants
filed for en banc review of the Court of Appeals’ decision. In February 2023, the Court of Appeals denied defendants’ en banc petitions.
Allergan Complaint for Indemnity
In 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. This
suit was voluntarily discontinued without prejudice in January 2021.
Viatris Securities Litigation
In October 2021, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on behalf of former Mylan N.V.
shareholders who received Viatris common stock in exchange for Mylan shares in connection with the spin-off of the Upjohn Business and its combination
with Mylan (the Transactions). Viatris, Pfizer, and certain of each company’s current and former officers, directors and employees are named as defendants. An
amended complaint was filed in January 2023, and alleges that the defendants violated certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with
certain disclosures made in or omitted from the registration statement and related prospectus issued in connection with the Transactions, as well as related
communications. Plaintiff seeks damages, costs and expenses and other equitable and injunctive relief.
A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
We are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate.
Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or
deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the
U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. These matters often involve government requests for information on a voluntary basis or through
subpoenas after which the government may seek additional information through follow-up requests or additional subpoenas. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in
which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.
Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.
Greenstone Investigations
•U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation
Since July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related
to an ongoing broader antitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have produced records relating to this investigation.

•State Attorneys General and Multi-District Generics Antitrust Litigation
In April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019,
Attorneys General of more than 40 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies,
including Greenstone and Pfizer. The matter has been consolidated with a MDL in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the
complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. In June 2020, the State Attorneys
General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar allegations, but concerning a new set of
drugs. This complaint was transferred to the MDL in July 2020. The MDL also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties against
Pfizer, Greenstone and a significant number of other defendants asserting allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General.
Subpoena & Civil Investigative Demand relating to Tris Pharma/Quillivant XR
In October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our
relationship with another drug manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We responded to that
subpoena in full and have had no communication with the SDNY in connection with the subpoena since June 2019. Additionally, in September 2020, we
received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Texas Attorney General’s office seeking records of a similar nature to those requested by the SDNY. We
are producing records in response to this request.
Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies
In February 2019, we received a CID from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the SDNY. The CID seeks records and information related to alleged quality issues
involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at the Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
Eastern District of Missouri, in coordination with the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, seeking similar records and information. We are
producing records in response to these and subsequent requests.
U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to Russian Operations
In June 2019, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Unit seeking documents relating to
our operations in Russia. In September 2019, we received a similar request from the SEC’s FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.
Docetaxel––Mississippi Attorney General Government Investigation
See Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation––Docetaxel––Mississippi Attorney General Government Action above for information regarding a government
investigation related to Docetaxel marketing practices.
U.S. Department of Justice Inquiries relating to India Operations
In March 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch seeking documents relating to our
manufacturing operations in India, including at our former facility located at Irrungattukottai in India. In April 2020, we received a similar request from the
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the SDNY regarding a civil investigation concerning operations at our facilities in India. We are producing records pursuant to these
requests.
U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to China Operations
In June 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in China. In
August 2020, we received a similar request from the SEC’s FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.
Zantac––State of New Mexico and Mayor and City Council of Baltimore Civil Actions
See Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation––Zantac above for information regarding civil actions separately filed by the State of New Mexico and the Mayor
and City Council of Baltimore alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants’ alleged sale of Zantac in those
jurisdictions.
Government Inquiries relating to Biohaven
In June 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice's Commercial Litigation Branch and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York issued a CID
relating to Biohaven. The CID seeks records and information related to, among other things, engagements with health care professionals and co-pay coupons
cards. In March 2023, the California Department of Insurance issued a subpoena seeking records similar to those requested by the CID. Biohaven is a wholly-
owned subsidiary that we acquired in October 2022. We are producing records in response to these requests.

U.S. Department of Justice Inquiry relating to Mexico Operations
In March 2023, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice’s FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in Mexico. We
are producing records pursuant to this request.
Government Inquiries relating to Xeljanz
In April 2023, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, in coordination with the Department of
Justice’s Commercial Litigation Branch, seeking records and information related to programs Pfizer sponsored in retail pharmacies relating to Xeljanz. We are
producing records pursuant to this request.
B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against
certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the
indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These
indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as
of July 2, 2023, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer.
In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, in
November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the
transaction and as previously disclosed, each of Viatris and Pfizer has agreed to assume, and to indemnify the other for, liabilities arising out of certain matters.
Also, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, includes
certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in
connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.
See Note 7D for information on Pfizer Inc.’s guarantee of the debt issued by PIE in May 2023.
We have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer.
C. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions
We may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. See Note 1D in our
2022 Form 10-K.
Note 13. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information
A. Segment Information
We manage our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation, an operating
segment established in the first quarter of 2023 that includes PC1, our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty
active pharmaceutical ingredients, and Pfizer Ignite, a recently launched offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&D services to select
innovative biotech companies that align with Pfizer’s R&D focus areas. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility
for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that
are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&D
services from WRDM and GPD. These services include IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each
operating segment has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of
the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.
Other Business Activities and Reconciling Items––Other business activities include the operating results of Business Innovation as well as certain pre-tax costs
not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with: (i) R&D and medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization and costs
associated with our GPD organization; (ii) corporate enabling functions and other corporate costs; (iii) overhead costs primarily associated with our
manufacturing operations; and (iv) our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV. Reconciling items include the following items, transactions
and events that are not allocated to our operating segments: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; and (iii) certain significant
items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a
result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.

Excludes revenues for certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech, which are included in the PC1 contract development and manufacturing organization.
See footnote (e) below.
Immunoglobulin (Ig) portfolio includes the revenues from Panzyga, Octagam and Cutaquig.
Erbitux is a registered trademark of ImClone LLC.
PC1 includes revenues from our contract manufacturing, including certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech ($6 million and $10 million for the second
quarter and the first six months of 2023, respectively, and $55 million and $101 million for the second quarter and the first six months of 2022, respectively), and revenues from our active
pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, as well as revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with former legacy Pfizer businesses/partnerships.
Remaining Performance Obligations––Contracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term
contracts to supply Comirnaty to our customers totaled approximately $9 billion as of July 2, 2023, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred,
as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver these products to our customers in future periods. Of this amount, current contract terms provide for
expected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2023 through 2026, the timing and terms of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance
obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal second quarter of 2023 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract
duration of less than one year.
Deferred Revenues––Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored
customers in international markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty total $1.2 billion as of July 2, 2023, with $1.2 billion
and $28 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $2.5 billion as of
December 31, 2022, with $2.4 billion and $77 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Comirnaty deferred
revenues during the first six months of 2023 was primarily the result of amounts recognized in Revenues as we delivered the products to our customers,
partially offset by additional advance payments received as we entered into amended contracts and the impact of foreign exchange. During the second quarter
and first six months of 2023, we recognized revenue of approximately $300 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, that was included in the balance of
Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of July 2, 2023 will be recognized in Revenues proportionately as
we transfer control of the product to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities
expected to be recognized in Revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues in
2024. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of July 2, 2023 or December 31, 2022.V600E/K ® (d)

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
GENERAL
The following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts
and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.
References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate
changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting
operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.
OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
Our Business and Strategy––Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies
to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizer’s near- and
longer-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently
acquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.
Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.
We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception
and through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end
R&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated
while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this
program, see the Costs and Expenses––Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
section within MD&A.
In July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing
how our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a
new end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining
therapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.
For additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,
Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.
Our Business Development Initiatives––We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product
pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business
development activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:
Proposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio––In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of
AstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent
with our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can
have a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of
up to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to
customary closing conditions.
Agreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)––In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative
medicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset
programs by leveraging Flagship’s ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an
option to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and
royalties for each successfully commercialized program.
38
Termination of Collaboration Arrangement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA)––In March 2023, it was announced that our alliance with
Merck KGaA to co-develop and co-commercialize Bavencio (avelumab) will terminate. Effective June 30, 2023, Merck KGaA took full control of the global
commercialization of Bavencio. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the current profit share will be replaced by a 15% royalty to Pfizer on net sales of
Bavencio. We and Merck KGaA will continue to operationalize our respective ongoing clinical trials for Bavencio; and Merck KGaA will control all future
R&D activities.
For a description of the more significant recent transactions through February 23, 2023, the filing date of our 2022 Form 10-K, see Note 2 in our 2022 Form
10-K.
Our Second Quarter 2023 and First Six Months of 2023 Performance
Revenues––Revenues decreased $15.0 billion, or 54%, in the second quarter of 2023 to $12.7 billion from $27.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting
an operational decrease of $14.7 billion, or 53%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $283 million, or 1%. The operational decrease was
primarily driven by declines in Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $537 million, or 5%,
operationally, reflecting revenues from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, and strong growth from the Vyndaqel family, partially
offset by declines in Inflectra in the U.S. and Ibrance.
Revenues decreased $22.4 billion, or 42%, in the first six months of 2023 to $31.0 billion from $53.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, reflecting an
operational decrease of $21.4 billion, or 40%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.0 billion, or 2%. The operational decrease was
primarily driven by declines in Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 5%,
operationally, reflecting revenues from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, as well as strong growth from the Vyndaqel family and
Eliquis, and increased Sulperazon revenues in China in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decline in Ibrance.
As of August 1, 2023, on a total company basis, we forecasted revenues in 2023 of $67 billion to $70 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the
midpoint from 2022 results, which we expect will also have an unfavorable impact on Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes
on income. The total company expected revenue declines in 2023 are driven by an expected reduction in sales of our COVID-19 products, partially offset by
expected operational growth from our non-COVID-19 in-line portfolio, anticipated new product and indication launches, and recently acquired products.
See the Revenues by Geography and Revenues––Selected Product Discussion sections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our
revenue performance. See also The Global Economic Environment––COVID-19 section below for information about our COVID-19 products, including
expectations, risks and uncertainties for 2023. For information regarding the primary indications or class of certain products, see Note 13C.
Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income––The decreases in Income from continuing operations before
provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $9.2 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and $12.0 billion in the first six months of 2023, compared to the same
periods in 2022, were primarily due to lower revenues and an increase in Selling, informational and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower Cost of
sales and net gains on equity securities in the second quarter of 2023 versus net losses recognized in the second quarter of 2022, and lower net losses on equity
securities for the first six months of 2023.
See the Analysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income within MD&A and Note 4. See also The Global Economic Environment––COVID-19
section below for information about our COVID-19 products, including expectations for 2023. For information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see
the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income section within MD&A and Note 5.
Our Operating Environment––We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the
topics listed below, as well as in the Item 1. Business––Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections, and the Overview of
Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––Our Operating Environment section of the MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K and the Item 1A.
Risk Factors section of this Form 10-Q.
Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights––The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation
settlements and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have
experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased
generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent
expiries from 2023 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-
line products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against
39
infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure
appropriate patient access.
For additional information, see the Item 1. Business––Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights and the Item 1A. Risk Factors––Intellectual Property
Protection sections of our 2022 Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 12A1.
Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group Pressures––Governments globally, as well as private third-party payers in
the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, proposing pricing reform or legislation, employing formularies to control
costs, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market
access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency
evaluation processes and volume-based procurement. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures
globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing, which could result in legislative and
regulatory changes designed to control costs. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA, which was signed into law in August 2022, on our business,
operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition,
changes to the Medicaid program or the federal 340B drug pricing program, including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect
to the 340B program, could have a material impact on our business. See the Item 1. Business––Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and ––
Government Regulation and Price Constraints and the Item 1A. Risk Factors––Pricing and Reimbursement sections, and the Overview of Our Performance,
Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––Our Operating Environment section of the MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.
Impact of Recent Tornado in Rocky Mount, North Carolina (NC)––Our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC was damaged by a tornado in July 2023.
The facility is a key producer of sterile injectables and is responsible for manufacturing nearly 25 percent of all our sterile injectables—including anesthesia,
analgesia, and micronutrients—which is nearly eight percent of all the sterile injectables used in U.S. hospitals. The HiRise warehouse sustained major damage
and all raw materials, packaging supplies and finished medicines stored within were damaged. All necessary supplies have been reordered for expedited
delivery and we are actively engaging with suppliers. We are working diligently to move product stored within other areas of the facility not impacted by the
event to other nearby sites for storage and to secure temporary warehouse space in the vicinity, as an interim solution, until the warehouse on the Rocky Mount
campus can be rebuilt. We are also exploring alternative manufacturing locations for production across our significant manufacturing presence in the U.S. and
internationally and across our partner network. After an initial assessment, there does not appear to be major damage to the production areas. We are committed
to rapidly restoring full function to the site. We are providing financial support to help local communities affected by the natural disaster. We are currently
evaluating the financial impact of the tornado on our business, including costs to repair and rebuild the site, inventory losses, potential losses from stock
outages at the hospital/retail level, overhead costs related to the period in which the plant may be inoperable, as well as other one-time remediation and/or other
incremental costs which may be necessary as we work to bring our plant back online, but we are unable to predict the impact or insurance recoveries with
certainty at this time.
Product Supply––We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or man-made
disasters. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their
product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. This has led to recalls, including our voluntary recall of Chantix in 2021 and
additional voluntary recalls initiated for other products in 2022 due to the presence of nitrosamines above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit, and may
lead to additional recalls or other market actions for Pfizer products.
Except for the recent tornado in Rocky Mount, NC discussed above, we have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in the first six months of
2023 and to date, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels; however, we continue to see heightened
demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading to a possible future
impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active
supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on risks related to product
manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors––Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section of our 2022 Form 10-K.
The Global Economic Environment––In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of
activities, are exposed to economic cycles. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––The Global Economic
Environment section of the MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.
COVID-19––In response to COVID-19, we have developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty, including, subject to
approval, an Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent vaccine. As part of our strategy for
40
COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant additional investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing. This includes continuing to
evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential
combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. See the
Product Developments section within MD&A.
In the first six months of 2023 and to date, we principally sold Comirnaty globally under government contracts and Paxlovid globally to government agencies
and distributors. We expect Comirnaty in the U.S. will transition to traditional commercial market sales in the second half of 2023, triggered by the expiration
of current contracts and the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech purchased through them becoming either depleted or not used following the
introduction of a new variant vaccine. Internationally, we expect sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets to generally be under government
contracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a combination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we expect to generally transition
to commercial markets starting in 2024. For Paxlovid, we expect to transition to traditional commercial markets in the second half of 2023 rather than
significant government purchases. We anticipate this transition in the U.S. to occur in the second half of 2023, though at this point we have not yet agreed on a
transition plan with the U.S. government. We also remain committed to helping ensure broad and equitable access to our COVID-19 products to eligible
patients around the world. Revenues from our COVID-19 products are expected to go from their peak in 2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially
returning to growth in 2024. While patient demand for our COVID-19 products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that demand is expected
to be fulfilled by existing supply of products that were delivered to governments and recorded as revenues in 2022. As of August 1, 2023, we forecasted
Comirnaty revenues of approximately $13.5 billion in 2023, down 64% from actual 2022 results, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, and
Paxlovid revenues of approximately $8 billion in 2023, down 58% from actual 2022 results. These forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions that are
subject to significant uncertainties, including, among others, patient demand, which could be significantly impacted by the infectiousness and severity of the
predominant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during 2023, proportion of the population that receives a vaccine or is treated with an oral antiviral treatment, the
number of doses per vaccinated person per year, number of symptomatic infections, market share of Comirnaty and Paxlovid and the timing for transitioning
Comirnaty and Paxlovid to commercial markets in the U.S.
For information on the impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial conditions and results and risks associated with COVID-19 and our
COVID-19 products, as well as COVID-19 intellectual property disputes, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—COVID-19, —Intellectual Property Protection and —
Third-Party Intellectual Property Claims sections and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section of the MD&A
of our 2022 Form 10-K, as well as Notes 8A, 12A1 and Forward-Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results of this Form 10-Q.
Russia/Ukraine Conflict––Our global operations may be impacted by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For both the six months ended July 2,
2023 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the business of our Russia and Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues
and assets, and while we are monitoring the effects of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation continues to evolve and the long-term
implications, including the broader economic consequences of the conflict, are difficult to predict at this time. While as of now, we do not anticipate any
significant negative impacts on our business from this conflict, continued regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential additional sanctions and other
restrictive measures against Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, any retaliatory measures taken by Russia, neighboring countries or allies of
Russia, and actions by our customers or suppliers, including financial institutions, in response to such measures could adversely affect the global
macroeconomic environment, our operations, currency exchange rates and financial markets, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results of
operations. For additional information on our response to the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as risks associated with the conflict, see the
Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations section and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section of the MD&A
of our 2022 Form 10-K.

Emerging markets revenues decreased $6.1 billion, or 45%, in the first six months of 2023 to $7.3 billion from $13.4 billion in the first six months of 2022,
reflecting an operational decrease of $5.6 billion, or 42%, and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 3%. The operational decrease in emerging
markets was primarily driven by declines from Comirnaty, partially offset by growth from Paxlovid, as well as increased Sulperazon revenues in the first
quarter of 2023 largely driven by demand in China.
Revenue Deductions––Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that
the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when
estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or
updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can
have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales decreased $5.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and $10.5 billion in the first six months of 2023, primarily due to:
•a reduction of $4.3 billion in the second quarter and $9.8 billion in the first six months due to lower sales of Comirnaty and, to a much lesser extent, by lower
write-offs of approximately $300 million in the second quarter and $240 million in the first six months for Comirnaty inventory that exceeded or was
expected to exceed its approved shelf-life prior to being used; and
•a reduction of $1.0 billion in the second quarter and $630 million in the first six months due to lower sales of Paxlovid.
The decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter and in the first six months of 2023 was mainly driven by favorable changes in
sales mix, including lower sales of Comirnaty, and to a much lesser extent by lower write-offs for Comirnaty discussed above, partially offset by lower sales of
Paxlovid.
Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses
Selling, informational and administrative expenses increased $448 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2023,
primarily due to:
•increases of $410 million in the second quarter and $970 million in the first six months in marketing and promotional expenses ($280 million in the second
quarter and $560 million in the first six months for recently acquired and launched products, and $130 million in the second quarter and $410 million in the
first six months for the expected Paxlovid commercial launch); and
•increases of $130 million in the second quarter and $210 million in the first six months in our liability to be paid to participants of our supplemental savings
plan,
partially offset by:
•decreases of $120 million in the second quarter and $170 million in the first six months due to a lower provision for U.S. healthcare reform fees associated
with lower sales of Paxlovid and Comirnaty.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses decreased $167 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to:
•lower spending of $190 million on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19; and
•a decrease of $100 million in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting the decrease in the price of Pfizer’s common stock,
partially offset by:
•increased investments of $130 million to develop recently acquired assets and certain vaccine programs, as well as activities to support upcoming product
launches.
Research and development expenses increased $37 million in the first six months of 2023, primarily driven by:
•increased costs of $530 million to develop recently acquired assets and certain vaccine programs, and other late stage clinical programs as well as activities
to support upcoming product launches,
partially offset by:
•lower spending of $390 million on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19; and
•a decrease of $80 million in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting the decrease in the price of Pfizer’s common stock.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
Acquired in-process research and development expenses decreased $301 million in the first six months of 2023, primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of (i)
an upfront payment to Biohaven and a premium paid on our equity investment in Biohaven totaling $263 million and (ii) a $76 million premium paid on our
equity investment in BioNTech to develop a potential mRNA vaccine against shingles, both recorded in the first quarter of 2022.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of intangible assets increased $362 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $630 million in the first six months of 2023, primarily as a result of
amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT, partially offset by fully amortized assets.
Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
Transforming to a More Focused Company Program––For a description of our program, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see Note 3A. The program
savings discussed below may be rounded and represent approximations. In connection with restructuring our corporate enabling functions, we achieved gross
cost savings of $1.0 billion, or net cost savings, excluding
46
merit and inflation growth and certain real estate cost increases, of $700 million, in the two year period from 2021 through 2022. In connection with
transforming our commercial go-to market strategy, we expect net cost savings of $1.4 billion, to be achieved primarily from 2022 through 2024. In connection
with manufacturing network optimization, we expect net cost savings of $550 million to be achieved primarily from 2020 through 2023. In connection with
optimizing our end-to-end R&D operations, we expect net cost savings of $2.3 billion to be achieved primarily from 2023 through 2025.
Certain qualifying costs for this program in all periods since inception were recorded and reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-
GAAP measure of Adjusted Income. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&A.
In addition to this program, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of
exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.
Other (Income)/Deductions—Net
The favorable period-over-period change of $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2023, compared to the second quarter of 2022, was primarily driven by (i) net
gains on equity securities recognized in the second quarter of 2023 versus net losses in the second quarter of 2022, and (ii) net periodic benefit credits
associated with pension and postretirement plans recorded in the second quarter of 2023 versus net periodic benefit costs recorded in the second quarter of
2022.
The favorable period-over-period change of $1.4 billion for the first six months of 2023, compared to the first six months of 2022, was primarily driven by (i)
lower net losses on equity securities, (ii) higher dividend income and (iii) lower net interest expense, partially offset by (iv) intangible asset impairment charges
recorded in the first six months of 2023.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS
A comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline was published as of August 1, 2023 and is available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-
pipeline. It includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as
mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.
This section provides information as of the date of this filing about significant marketing application-related regulatory actions by, and filings pending with, the
FDA and regulatory authorities in the EU and Japan.
The tables below include filing and approval milestones for products that have occurred in the last twelve months and generally do not include approvals that
may have occurred prior to that time. The tables include filings with regulatory decisions pending (even if the filing occurred outside of the last twelve-month
period).
COVID-19 Vaccine Products
U.S.––In April 2023, in order to simplify the vaccination schedule for most individuals, the FDA amended an EUA for the emergency use of the
Pfizer ‑ BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5), which has been developed in collaboration with BioNTech, for active
immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 6 months of age and older. In the
U.S., the original monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is no longer authorized for emergency use or CDC-recommended, although Comirnaty
remains a licensed vaccine. This decision relates entirely to the FDA’s strategy to harmonize COVID-19 vaccines and is not indicative of any safety-related
signals or concerns.

In February 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for approval of the
companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5)) as
a primary series and booster dose(s) for individuals 12 years of age and older.
In June 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the companies have submitted a regulatory application to the FDA for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted
monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.
The following table contains the authorized uses of the Pfizer ‑ BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) for the various

“Original monovalent” refers to a COVID-19 vaccine that contains or encodes the spike protein of only the Original SARS-CoV -2.
Notwithstanding the age limitations for use of the vaccine, individuals turning from 4 to 5 years of age during the vaccination series should receive all doses with the Pfizer -BioNT ech COVID-19 Vaccine,
Bivalent.
Notwithstanding the age limitations for use of the vaccine, individuals turning from 4 to 5 years of age during the vaccination series should receive 2 doses with the Pfizer -BioNT ech COVID-19 Vaccine,
Bivalent.
For individuals with certain kinds of immunocompromise 6 months through 4 years of age who have received three 0.2 mL doses (the Pfizer ‑ BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine or the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent), a fourth dose (0.2 mL) with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent may
be administered at least one month following the most recent dose; additional doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent may be administered
at the discretion of the healthcare provider, taking into consideration the individual’s clinical circumstances. For individuals with certain kinds of
immunocompromise 5 years of age and older, a single additional age-appropriate dose of the Pfizer ‑ BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent may be
administered at least 2 months following the initial dose of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine; additional age ‑ appropriate doses of the Pfizer ‑ BioNTech COVID ‑ 19
Vaccine, Bivalent may be administered at the discretion of the healthcare provider, taking into consideration the individual’s clinical circumstances.
EU and Japan––In March 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the submission of an application to the EMA to extend the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted
bivalent vaccine’s marketing authorization (MA) to include use in children six months through 4 years of age as both primary series (all three doses) and
booster vaccination (fourth dose).
In February 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the submission of an application to the EMA for a variation of the MA to include the bivalent vaccine as a
primary course of vaccination in individuals 5 years of age and older.
In July 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the companies have submitted a regulatory application to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency
(Japan) for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.
In June 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the companies have submitted regulatory application to the EMA for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME
Adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported
performance measures. As such, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income,
certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture,
marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:(a)

Most directly comparable GAAP measure.
The short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part versus three budgeted
metrics, one of which is Adjusted diluted EPS (as defined for annual incentive compensation purposes), which is derived from Adjusted income and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied
to financial performance. Additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income, which is derived from Adjusted income. Beginning in the first quarter
of 2022, we no longer exclude any expenses for acquired IPR&D from our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we continue to exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual
incentive compensation purposes. The bonus pool funding, which is largely based on financial performance, is adjusted by our R&D pipeline performance, as measured by four metrics, and
performance against certain of our ESG metrics, and may be further modified by our Compensation Committee’s assessment of other factors.
Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and,
therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar
measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these
measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance
to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of Net income attributable to
Pfizer Inc. common shareholders, components of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common
shareholders—diluted, respectively.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process
solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity
targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded
pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.
Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
Amortization of Intangible Assets—Adjusted income excludes all amortization of intangible assets.
Acquisition-Related Items—Adjusted income excludes certain acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges
and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to
restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies. Acquisition-related items may include
purchase accounting impacts such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation
related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value
changes for contingent consideration.
Discontinued Operations—Adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such
operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we
do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation
or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.(a) 
(b)(a)
(a)
(a)
(b)
52
Certain Significant Items—Adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on
a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably
possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal
with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic
conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the
result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters related to divested
products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities, and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree
of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and
losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our
ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that
would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted information—
Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items and the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&A of

ANALYSIS OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
 Six Months Ended
(MILLIONS)July 2,
2023July 3,
2022 Drivers of change
Cash provided by/(used in):
Operating activities $ 4 $ 14,711 The change was primarily driven by a decrease in net income adjusted for
non-cash items and the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course
of business, including timing of payments to BioNTech for the gross profit
split for Comirnaty (see Note 8B) and a decrease in advance payments for
Comirnaty and Paxlovid.
Investing activities $ (22,170)$ (10,746)The change was driven mainly by $17.7 billion greater net purchases of short-
term investments in 2023, partially offset by $6.2 billion cash used to acquire
Arena, net of cash acquired, in 2022.
Financing activities $ 24,403 $ (4,058)The change was driven mainly by $30.8 billion of proceeds from the issuance
of long-term debt in 2023 and $2.0 billion of purchases of common stock in
2022, partially offset by a net $4.4 billion decrease in proceeds from short-
term borrowings.
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK
Our historically robust operating cash flows, which we expect to continue, is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding
source. We believe as a result of this, together with our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we
have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other
obligations for the foreseeable future. For information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources, as well as our operating cash flows, see
our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equity, and the
Analysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within MD&A. For information on our money market funds, available-for sale-debt
securities and long-term debt, see Note 7.
For information about our diverse sources of funds, off-balance sheet arrangements, contractual and other obligations, global economic conditions, market risk
and LIBOR, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A in our 2022 Form 10-K. For more
information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12B.
Debt Issuance––In May 2023, we completed a public offering of $31 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes as part of the financing for
our proposed acquisition of Seagen. The net proceeds have been invested in short-term investments in a combination of money market funds and available-for-
sale debt securities until the completion of the proposed acquisition. See Notes 7A and 7D.
Credit Ratings––The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial
or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. In March 2023, following the announcement of the
proposed acquisition of Seagen, Moody’s changed the outlook on our long-term debt to Negative; S&P downgraded our short-term rating from A-1+ to A-1.
As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:
NAME OF RA TING AGENCY Pfizer Short-T erm Rating Pfizer Long-T erm Rating Outlook/W atch
Moody’ s P-1 A1 Negative Outlook
S&P A-1 A+ Stable
These ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating
organizations. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Debt Capacity––Lines of Credit––As of July 2, 2023, we had access to a $7 billion committed U.S. revolving credit facility, which may be used for general
corporate purposes including to support our commercial paper borrowings. Lenders under this facility have approximately $700 million of commitments
maturing in November 2026 and $6.3 billion of commitments maturing in November 2027. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facility, our lenders have
provided us an additional $304 million in lines of credit, of which $274 million expire within one year. Essentially all lines of credit were unused as of July 2,
2023.
55
Capital Allocation Framework––Our capital allocation framework is primarily devised to facilitate the achievement of medical breakthroughs through R&D
investments and business development activities and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to finance the
proposed acquisition of Seagen substantially through $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023, and the balance from a combination of short-term
financing and existing cash. See Note 1A and the Item 1A. Risk Factors section for additional information about our proposed acquisition of Seagen. In April
2023, our BOD declared a dividend of $0.41 per share, paid on June 9, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 12, 2023. In June 2023,
our BOD declared a dividend of $0.41 per share, payable on September 5, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 28, 2023. At July 2,
2023, our remaining share-purchase authorization was $3.3 billion, with no repurchases in the first six months of 2023. See Note 12 in our 2022 Form 10-K for
more information on our publicly announced share-purchase plans.
Our financing plan for Seagen does not involve monetizing any portion of our Haleon stake. Our intentions with respect to our Haleon stake are set out in our
Schedule 13D (as amended) initially filed with the SEC on July 27, 2022.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
See Note 1B.
Recently Issued Accounting Standard, Not Adopted as of July 2, 2023
Standard/Description Effective DateEffect on the
Financial Statements
In June 2022, the F ASB issued final guidance to clarify that a  contractual r estriction on the sale of
an equity security  is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is
not considered when measuring fair value. Recognizing a contractual sale restriction as a separate unit
of account is not permitted.January 1, 2024, with early
adoption permitted.We are assessing the impact, but
currently do not expect this new
guidance to have a material
impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. We also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public, as well as public
oral statements. Given their forward-looking nature, these statements involve substantial risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions.

operations; disruption to business and operations relationships; risks related to growing revenues for certain acquired products; significant transaction costs;
and unknown liabilities;
•risks and uncertainties related to Pfizer’s proposed acquisition of Seagen, including, among other things, risks related to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to closing the proposed acquisition (including the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals) in the anticipated timeframe or at all, including

for COVID-19 products becomes more endemic and seasonal, demand for any of our COVID-19 products may be reduced, no longer exist or not meet
expectations, which may lead to reduced revenues or excess inventory on-hand and/or in the channel which, for Paxlovid, could result in significant
inventory write-offs; challenges related to and uncertainties regarding the timing of a transition to the commercial market for any of our products;

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Information required by this item is incorporated by reference from the discussion in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and
Market Risk section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the SEC.
59
During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Note 12A.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
We refer to the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Operating Environment and —The Global Economic
Environment sections and the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results section within MD&A of this Form 10-Q and of our
2022 Form 10-K and to the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our 2022 Form 10-K. We are including the following risk factors, which should be read in
conjunction with the risk factors discussed in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our 2022 Form 10-K.
PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF SEAGEN
We may be unable to complete the acquisition of Seagen within the anticipated timeframe or at all, which could prevent us from receiving the
anticipated benefits from the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all.
On March 12, 2023, we entered into a merger agreement with Seagen. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to
customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. As a result, there is no assurance that the acquisition will be consummated in
the anticipated timeframe or at all. In addition, Pfizer may be required to pay Seagen a reverse termination fee of approximately $2.22 billion, subject to certain
limitations set forth in the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is terminated by either party as a result of certain antitrust and/or foreign direct
investment law-related conditions. Any failure to consummate the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all could prevent Pfizer from receiving the
expected benefits from the acquisition. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Business Development
Initiatives and the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results sections within MD&A.
We have expended and will continue to expend significant time and resources in connection with the acquisition of Seagen and have incurred
substantial indebtedness to fund the acquisition.
Pfizer has expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and expenses related to the acquisition of Seagen, many of which
must be paid regardless of whether the acquisition is consummated. For example, such time, resources and expenses will be incurred in connection with
seeking regulatory approvals for the transaction. We intend to finance a portion of the transaction with the proceeds from the $31 billion of long-term debt
issued in May 2023, plus additional short-term indebtedness to be issued prior to the acquisition, which indebtedness may limit our operating or financial
flexibility relative to our current position.
We may not be successful in identifying and executing potential business development transactions, such as our acquisition of Seagen, or realizing the
financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any historical or potential business development transaction, which could have an
adverse impact on our ability to meet our growth objectives.
We have established significant growth goals, which we plan to achieve, in part, by accelerating revenue growth by not only advancing our own product
pipelines and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various forms of business development activities, which can include alliances,
licenses, JVs, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. Our proposed acquisition of Seagen is part
of that accelerated revenue growth plan. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing
opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. The success of our business development activities is
dependent on the availability and accurate evaluation of appropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our
ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability to satisfy or waive closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes, or at
all, and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and develop and commercialize acquired products. Pursuing, executing and consummating
these transactions may require substantial investment, which may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which could result in increased
leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings or limit our operating or financial flexibility relative to our current position. The success of our business
development transactions depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
many of which are
60
outside of our control, including the possibility that the expected benefits from such transactions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected
time period. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from
acquired products and businesses. We may fail to generate expected revenue growth for our existing products, product pipeline and acquired products or
businesses or we may fail to achieve anticipated cost savings, such as those expected with respect to Seagen, within expected time frames or at all, which may
impact our ability to meet our growth objectives. In certain transactions, we may agree to provide certain transition services for an extended period of time,
which may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business. Similarly, the accretive impact
anticipated from transactions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these products or businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the
disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Further, while we seek to
mitigate risks and liabilities through, among other things, due diligence, we may be exposed to risks and liabilities as a result of business development
transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of
our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position.
