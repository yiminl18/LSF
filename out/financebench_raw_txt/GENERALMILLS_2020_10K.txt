 PART I 
 
ITEM 1 - Business  
 
General Mills, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The terms “General Mills,” “Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” and “our” 
mean General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context 
indicates otherwise. 
 
Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. 
 
COMPANY OVERVIEW 
 
We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We also are a leading supplier 
of branded and unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. We are also a leading 
manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We manufacture our products in 13 countries and market them 
in more than 100 countries. In addition to our consolidated operations, we have 50 percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that 
manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide. 
 
The results of our Pet operating segment include 13 months of results in fiscal 2020 as we changed the Pet operating segment’s reporting 
period from an April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. Fiscal 2019 included 12 months of results, 
and fiscal 2018 did not include results for the Pet operating segment. 
 
We manage and review the financial results of our business under five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores 
& Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments. 
 
We offer a variety of food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the world. Our 
business is focused on the following large, global categories: 
 
 snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks; 
 ready-to-eat cereal; 
 convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees; 
 yogurt; 
 wholesome natural pet food;  
 super-premium ice cream; 
 baking mixes and ingredients; and 
 refrigerated and frozen dough.  
 
Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready-to-eat cereal category in markets 
outside North America, and our Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super-premium ice cream category in 
Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products, please see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 
8 of this report. 
 
Customers 
Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, 
e-commerce retailers, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores, and pet 
specialty stores. We generally sell to these customers through our direct sales force. We use broker and distribution arrangements for 
certain products and to serve certain types of customers. For further information on our customer credit and product return practices, 
please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2020, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates 
(Walmart) accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. No 
other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further information on significant customers, please 
refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
Competition 
The packaged and pet food categories are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and 
throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories 
are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-
mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition 
in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of 
 
5 
 marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer 
preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective customer 
relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs, 
an efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, 
but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we 
compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.  
 
Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging 
The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable oils, meats, nuts, 
vegetables, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metal packaging 
materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers 
in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from 
other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, climate change, product 
scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics (including the 
COVID-19 pandemic), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed 
price contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate 
supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to 
ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at 
price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our 
products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of 
risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient access to, and more informed 
knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net 
realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.  
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
Our research and development resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, process design and 
improvement, packaging, and exploratory research in new business and technology areas. Research and development expenditures were 
$224 million in fiscal 2020 and $222 million in fiscal 2019. 
 
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS 
 
Our products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks.  Some of the more important trademarks used in our global operations 
(set forth in italics in this report) include Annie’s, Betty Crocker , Bisquick, Blue Buffalo , Blue Basics , Blue Freedom , Blue Wilderness , 
Bugles, Cascadian  Farm, Cheerios, Chex, Cinnamon Toast Crunch , Cocoa Puffs , Cookie Crisp , EPIC, Fiber One , Food Should Taste 
Good, Fruit by the Foot , Fruit Gushers , Fruit Roll-Ups , Gardetto's , Go-Gurt, Gold Medal , Golden Grahams , Häagen-Dazs , Helpers, 
Jus-Rol, Kitano, Kix, Lärabar, Latina, Liberté, Lucky Charms , Muir Glen , Nature Valley , Oatmeal Crisp , Old El Paso , Oui, Pillsbury , 
Progresso , Raisin Nut Bran , Total, Totino’s, Trix, Wanchai Ferry , Wheaties, Yoki, and Yoplait. We protect these marks as appropriate 
through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long 
as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of 
trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.  
 
Some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others for both long-standing 
products (e.g., Reese’s Puffs  for cereal, Green Giant for vegetables in certain countries, and Cinnabon  for refrigerated dough, frozen 
pastries, and baking products) and shorter term promotional products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party equities). 
 
Our cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the Nestlé trademark. Nestlé licenses certain of its 
trademarks to CPW, including the Nestlé and Uncle Toby’s  trademarks.  The Häagen-Dazs  trademark is licensed royalty-free and 
exclusively to Nestlé for ice cream and other frozen dessert products in the United States and Canada.  The Häagen-Dazs  trademark is 
also licensed to HDJ.  The Pillsbury brand and the Pillsbury Doughboy  character are subject to an exclusive, royalty-free license that 
was granted to a third party and its successors in the dessert mix and baking mix categories in the United States and under limited 
circumstances in Canada and Mexico.     
 
The Yoplait trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Yoplait Marques SNC, an entity in which we own a 50 percent interest.  
These marks are licensed exclusively to Yoplait SAS, an entity in which we own a 51 percent interest.  Yoplait SAS licenses these 
trademarks to its franchisees. The Liberté trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Liberté Marques Sàrl, an entity in which 
we own a 50 percent interest.   
 
 
6 
 We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, recipes 
and formulations.  We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we 
do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. 
 
SEASONALITY 
 
In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America Retail segment demand 
for refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso soup 
is higher during the fall and winter months. Internationally, within our Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America segments, demand 
for Häagen-Dazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter 
months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, 
our international segments’ net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year. 
 
BACKLOG  
 
Orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. In the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2020, we experienced increased demand in our retail businesses as the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental 
restrictions resulted in a significant increase in at-home food consumption.  We have taken steps to increase our production capacity to 
meet the increased demand for our retail products, including increasing production time at our manufacturing facilities and prioritizing 
certain product lines to increase manufacturing efficiency.  Notwithstanding these efforts, we have been, and continue to be, unable to 
fulfill all orders we receive from our customers.  
 
WORKING CAPITAL 
 
A description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A in Item 7 of this report. Our product return practices 
are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
EMPLOYEES  
 
As of May 31, 2020, we had approximately 35,000 full- and part-time employees. 
 
QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION 
 
The manufacture and sale of consumer and pet food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to 
regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal 
Trade Commission, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our 
business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the United States. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
As of May 31, 2020, we were involved with two response actions associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous 
substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey.  
 
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all similar 
state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 
Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in 
general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or 
competitive position.

 ITEM 1A - Risk Factors 
 
Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
Global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely 
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
The public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, businesses, including us, 
and the public at large to limit COVID-19’s spread have had, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative impacts on our 
business, financial condition, and results of operations including, without limitation, the following: 
 
 We have experienced, and may continue to experience, a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the 
world that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, sales of our products in the away-from-home food 
outlets across all our major markets have been negatively affected by reduced consumer traffic resulting from shelter-in-place 
regulations or recommendations and closings of restaurants, schools and cafeterias. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists or 
intensifies, its negative impacts on our sales, particularly in away-from-home food outlets, could be more prolonged and may 
become more severe. 
 Deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased 
unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, 
could cause a decrease in demand for our products. 
 We have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We 
have implemented employee safety measures, based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
World Health Organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use, and 
temperature screenings. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. 
Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, 
manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future, which 
may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs.  
 Changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one 
quarter (such as occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020), resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in 
subsequent quarters. While we experienced increased demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, this 
increase may moderate or reverse if consumers alter their purchasing habits. Short term or sustained increases in consumer 
demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain.  
 The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital 
equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, and 
external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively 
impact our operations. 
 Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell, or distribute our products (including 
quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that 
limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business 
functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including 
operations necessary for the production, distribution, and sale of our products) could adversely impact our operations and 
results. 
 Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic 
may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us. 
 
The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are  not able to compete effectively, our results of 
operations could be adversely  affected. 
 
The consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are 
manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through 
brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In 
most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with 
generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product 
innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering 
and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an 
advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and 
profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth 
 
10 
 could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands 
or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior 
product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products. 
 
We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. 
 
There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, 
large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased 
reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional 
programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category 
leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the 
loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2020, Walmart accounted for 21 percent of our 
consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant customers, 
please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging,  and energy may adversely affect our profitability.  
 
The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, 
climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, 
pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. 
Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic. Commodity price changes 
may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these 
increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in 
commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend. 
 
Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility 
in our gross margins and net earnings. 
 
We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and 
corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in 
earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in 
our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the 
underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also 
record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. 
 
If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a  result of the highly competitive environment in which 
we operate.  
 
Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products 
in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through 
productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability 
and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and 
production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product 
volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce 
expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could 
adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.   
 
Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our 
manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics (such 
as the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair 
our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single 
supplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital 
equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to 
meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Our suppliers’ 
policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with significant suppliers, including 
disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially 
and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or 
 
11 
 potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single 
location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our 
supply chain. 
 
We have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have 
implemented employee safety measures, based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health 
Organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use, and temperature screenings. 
These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, 
or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We 
may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely 
manner or may increase our costs. 
 
We experienced increased demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and were, and continue to be, unable to fill all 
customer orders.  Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or 
otherwise strain our supply chain.  Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of 
operations. 
 
Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers to  avoid certain products or ingredients.  
 
We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products 
or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our 
products or cause production and delivery disruptions. 
 
If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might  need to recall those items and may experience product 
liability claims if  consumers or their pets are injured.  
 
We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could 
result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of 
product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product 
recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our 
products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. 
 
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends,  which may result in decreased demand for our 
products. 
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer 
products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may 
change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react 
to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely 
basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, 
demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, 
genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or attributes. 
 
We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster  growing and more profitable categories.  
 
The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business 
faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding 
innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase 
market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, 
our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. 
 
Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.   
 
The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, 
consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those 
circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. 
In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect 
margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from 
our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
12 
 Deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased 
unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a 
decrease in demand for our products. 
 
Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.   
 
Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our 
brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish 
significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity 
about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive 
consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. Consumer demand for our 
products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by 
consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative 
posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If 
we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted. 
 
Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.  
 
In fiscal 2020, 24 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a 
number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: 
 
 political and economic instability;  
 exchange controls and currency exchange rates;  
 tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;  
 nationalization or government control of operations; 
 compliance with anti-corruption regulations; 
 uncertainty relating to the impact of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union; 
 foreign tax treaties and policies; and  
 restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences. 
 
Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations 
could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British 
pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into 
agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective 
in significantly reducing our exposure. 
 
A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate, such as has generally occurred during 
the COVID-19 pandemic to-date, would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency 
translation losses and currency transaction losses. 
 
New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.   
 
Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the 
Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign 
governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and 
the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative 
penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and could be the target 
of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject 
to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are 
marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business 
or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. 
 
Significant COVID-19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products 
(including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that 
limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions 
or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations 
necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results. 
 
 
13 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations.  Our failure to comply with environmental 
laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies.  We are currently party to a variety of 
environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified 
contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance 
costs to differ from our estimates.  We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental 
laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect 
our ability to pay dividends. 
 
As of May 31, 2020, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $14.4 billion. The agreements under which 
we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness 
may limit our: 
 
 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the 
ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and 
 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general 
economic conditions. 
 
There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply 
with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its 
stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected. 
 
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial 
performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. 
 
Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity,  increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the 
operations of our suppliers  and customers.  
 
We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our 
operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our 
financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets 
will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our 
financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business 
could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets 
or a slowdown in the general economy. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets. We may not have access to preferred sources of 
liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur 
and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative 
effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital 
and as counterparties to our derivative contracts. 
 
From time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into interest rate swaps that 
contain a variable element based on an IBOR. There is currently uncertainty whether certain IBORs will continue to be available after 
2021. If certain IBORs cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index 
would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash 
flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.  
 
Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit  pension, 
other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.  
 
We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including 
defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans 
are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, 
mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded 
status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A 
significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash 
flows from operations. 
 
14 
 Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. 
 
Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business.  We rely on information 
technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of 
business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements.  Our information technology systems and infrastructure 
are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain 
management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication 
among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our 
employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on 
services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as 
catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer 
viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes.  Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security 
and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those 
systems.  The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in 
transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and 
customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts 
that may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital 
used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of 
operations and net worth. 
 
As of May 31, 2020, we had $20.5 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is 
tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We 
compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the 
reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair 
value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our 
long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other 
factors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions 
that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly 
impaired. Our Europe & Australia reporting unit had experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor this 
business. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our 
businesses could result in significant impairment losses. 
 
We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue Buffalo , Pillsbury, Totino’s, 
Progresso , Yoplait, Old El Paso , Yoki, Häagen-Dazs , and Annie’s brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a 
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, 
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results 
in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance 
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.  
 
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs 
including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and 
a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic 
conditions that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets 
could become significantly impaired. Our Pillsbury and Progresso  brands had experienced declining business performance, and we 
continue to monitor these businesses. 
 
For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of 
this report. 
 
Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. 
 
From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives.  Our success depends, 
in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations.  If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial 
results could suffer.  Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees 
and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic 
 
15 
 area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of 
goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.

 ITEM 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  Results of Operations 
 
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  
 
We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand 
names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and 
preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, 
and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in 
markets around the globe. 
 
Our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe achieving that goal 
requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash return to shareholders over 
time. 
 
Fiscal 2020 was a year of significant challenge and change in the external environment, and we adapted and executed to deliver strong 
financial results while remaining focused on the health and safety of our employees and our company purpose of making food the world 
loves. Prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expected to meet or exceed each of our key fiscal 2020 financial targets.  
The virus outbreak had a profound impact on consumer demand across our major markets, including driving an unprecedented increase 
in demand for food at home and a corresponding decrease in demand for away-from-home food, resulting from efforts to reduce virus 
transmission. After the onset of the pandemic, elevated at-home food demand accelerated net sales growth in the fourth quarter in the 
North America Retail segment, where a significant share of net sales comes from categories that were most impacted by at-home eating, 
including meals, baking, and cereal. The impact of elevated at-home demand was less pronounced in the Europe & Australia segment, 
reflecting its lower proportion of net sales in those categories. The Pet segment experienced increased demand early in the fourth quarter 
from stock-up purchasing, which partially unwound by the end of the quarter. Lower away-from-home food demand reduced growth 
for the Convenience Stores & Foodservice and Asia & Latin America segments. Consequently, our full-year results significantly 
exceeded our initial annual targets for organic net sales growth, constant-currency growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted 
diluted earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow conversion. 
We delivered on the three key priorities we outlined at the beginning of fiscal 2020: 
First, we accelerated our organic net sales growth rate compared to our fiscal 2019 performance, driven by strong execution to 
meet elevated demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthy levels of innovation, and a significant increase in capabilities 
and brand-building investment.  We experienced robust growth in organic net sales in North America Retail, aided by our 
ability to meet the pandemic-related increase in demand for meals and baking categories during the fourth quarter, as well as 
consistently strong results in U.S. cereal and important improvements in U.S. snack bars and U.S. yogurt throughout the year.  
We exceeded our organic net sales growth goal for our Pet segment, driven by a successful expansion of BLUE into additional 
customer outlets and a significant increase in household penetration for the brand.  Organic net sales results in our Convenience 
Stores & Foodservice, Europe & Australia, and Asia & Latin America segments were below fiscal 2019 levels, due to a slow 
start to the year in each of those segments, as well as the pandemic-related headwinds impacting Convenience Stores & 
Foodservice and Asia & Latin America in the second half of the year. 
Second, we maintained our strong adjusted operating profit margins.  The combination of our continued strong levels of Holistic 
Margin Management (HMM) savings, volume growth, and positive net price realization and mix offset input cost inflation and 
increased investments in brand building and capabilities, resulting in significant growth in constant-currency adjusted operating 
profit and adjusted diluted EPS.   
Third, we reduced our leverage.  Our continued cash discipline delivered a significant reduction in core working capital and 
strong free cash flow conversion, resulting in reduced debt and an important decrease in our leverage ratio. 
Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020 rose 5 percent to $17.6 billion. On an organic basis, net sales increased 4 percent compared 
to year-ago levels. Operating profit of $3.0 billion increased 17 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $3.0 billion increased 7 percent on 
a constant-currency basis.  Diluted EPS of $3.56 was up 23 percent compared to fiscal 2019 results. Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.61 
increased 12 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures 
not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). 
 
Net cash provided by operations totaled $3.7 billion in fiscal 2020 representing a conversion rate of 166 percent of net earnings, including 
earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $461 
million, and our resulting free cash flow was $3.2 billion at a conversion rate of 143 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings 
 
19 
 attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2 billion 
and reduced total debt outstanding by $1.0 billion.  Our ratio of net debt-to-operating cash flow was 3.2 in fiscal 2020, and our net debt-
to-adjusted earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA) ratio was 3.2, which 
was favorable to our fiscal 2020 target of 3.5 (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures 
not defined by GAAP). 
 
A detailed review of our fiscal 2020 performance compared to fiscal 2019 appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2020 Consolidated 
Results of Operations.” A detailed review of our fiscal 2019 performance compared to our fiscal 2018 performance is set forth in Part 
II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019 under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal 2019 Results of Consolidated Operations,” which is incorporated herein by 
reference. 
 
We have outlined three key priorities for fiscal 2021 that we expect will allow us to generate competitive performance while continuing 
to advance our long-term goals: 
 
1) Compete effectively, everywhere we play , leading to increased brand penetration, competitive service levels, strengthened 
customer partnerships, and market share gains in our key categories. We expect net sales growth in fiscal 2021 will be positively 
impacted by superior execution as well as elevated at-home food demand, relative to the pre-pandemic period. We anticipate 
headwinds to fiscal 2021 net sales growth from comparisons against the 53rd week, the extra month of Pet segment results, 
and the pandemic-related increase in demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, fiscal 2021 net sales growth 
may be negatively impacted by a potential reduction in consumers’ at-home food inventory, which has been elevated during 
the pandemic. 
2) Drive efficiency to fuel investment . We anticipate that the combination of benefits from our HMM initiatives and volume 
leverage and headwinds from input cost inflation, increased investment in our brands and capabilities, higher costs to service 
elevated demand, and higher ongoing health and safety-related expenses will result in an adjusted operating profit margin that 
is approximately in line with fiscal 2020 levels. 
3) Reduce leverage to increase financial flexibility . We expect to make further progress in fiscal 2021 in reducing our net debt-
to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. 
 
We expect the largest factor impacting our fiscal 2021 performance will be relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home 
consumer food demand. This balance will be determined by factors such as consumers’ ability and willingness to eat in restaurants, the 
proportion of people working from home, the reopening of schools, and changes in consumers’ income levels. While the COVID-19 
pandemic has significantly influenced each of these factors in recent months, the magnitude and duration of its future impact remains 
highly uncertain. 
 
We expect consumer concerns about COVID-19 virus transmission and the recession to drive elevated demand for food at home, relative 
to pre-pandemic levels. We are tracking the level of virus control, the possibility of a second-wave outbreak, the availability of a vaccine, 
GDP growth, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, and wage growth, among other factors, to assess the likely magnitude and 
duration of elevated at-home food demand.  
 
Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. 
 
FISCAL 2020 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
Fiscal 2020 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 includes 13 months of Pet operating segment results as we 
changed the Pet operating segment’s reporting period from an April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. 
Fiscal 2019 included 12 months of Pet operating segment results. 
 
In fiscal 2020, net sales increased 5 percent compared to last year and organic net sales increased 4 percent compared to last year. 
Operating profit margin of 16.8 percent was up 190 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by favorable net price realization 
and mix in fiscal 2020, impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets in fiscal 2019, and the impact of 
the 53rd week in fiscal 2020, partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in fiscal 2020. Adjusted 
operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 17.3 percent, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix in fiscal 
2020, the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020, and the purchase accounting inventory adjustment in fiscal 2019 related to our 
acquisition of Blue Buffalo Products, Inc. (Blue Buffalo), partially offset by higher SG&A expenses in fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per 
share of $3.56 increased 23 percent compared to fiscal 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.61 increased 12 percent on a 
constant-currency basis (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

The 5 percent increase in net sales in fiscal 2020 reflects higher contributions from volume growth and favorable net price realization 
and mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The 53rd week in fiscal 2020 contributed 2 percentage points of net 
sales growth, reflecting 2 percentage points of growth from volume. The fiscal 2020 increase in net sales growth includes approximately 
3 points of net sales growth due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Organic net sales in fiscal 2020 increased 4 percent compared to fiscal 2019, driven by increased contributions from organic volume 
growth and favorable organic net price realization and mix. The increase in organic net sales growth includes approximately 3 points of 
organic net sales growth due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
The disclosed impacts attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic on net sales and organic net sales were calculated based upon net sales 
in excess of our expectations prior to the net increase in demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts disclosed are 
approximate and reflect our best estimate of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
Cost of sales increased $388 million in fiscal 2020 to $11,497 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $397 million increase 
due to higher volume. In fiscal 2020, we recorded a $19 million charge related to a product recall in our international Green Giant 
business, an $18 million increase in certain compensation and benefits expenses, and a $1 million increase attributable to product rate 
and mix. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $53 million charge related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired in the Blue Buffalo 
acquisition. We recorded a $25 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions 
and grain inventories in fiscal 2020 compared to a net increase of $36 million in fiscal 2019 (please see Note 8 to the Consolidated 
 
21 
 Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). In fiscal 2020, we recorded $26 million of restructuring charges 
in cost of sales compared to $10 million in fiscal 2019. We also recorded $2 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in 
cost of sales in fiscal 2020 compared to $1 million in fiscal 2019 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 
of this report for additional information).  
 
Gross margin increased 6 percent in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019. Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased 70 basis points to 
34.8 percent compared to fiscal 2019.  
 
SG&A expenses  increased $216 million to $3,152 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in SG&A expenses 
primarily reflects increased compensation and benefits expenses and media and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower other 
consumer-related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2020 increased 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2019. 
 
Divestitures loss totaled $30 million in fiscal 2019 from the sale of our La Salteña  fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in 
Argentina and the sale of our yogurt business in China. 
 
Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $24 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $275 million in fiscal 2019. We did 
not undertake any new restructuring actions in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019, we recorded $193 million of impairment charges related to 
certain brand intangible assets and a $15 million charge related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets in our North America 
Retail and Asia & Latin America segments. In fiscal 2019, we also recorded $80 million of restructuring charges related to actions to 
drive efficiencies in targeted areas of our global supply chain. Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of 
this report for additional information. 
 
Benefit plan non-service income totaled $113 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $88 million in fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting lower 
interest costs (please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). 
 
Interest, net for fiscal 2020 totaled $466 million, $56 million lower than fiscal 2019, primarily driven by lower average debt levels.  
 
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 18.5 percent compared to 17.7 percent in fiscal 2019. The 0.8 percentage point increase was 
primarily due to certain nonrecurring discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2019, partially offset by the benefit from the reorganization of certain 
wholly-owned subsidiaries and favorable changes in earnings mix by jurisdiction in fiscal 2020. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.7 
percent in fiscal 2020 compared to 21.8 percent in fiscal 2019 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our 
use of measures not defined by GAAP). 
 
After-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 27 percent to $91 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily driven 
by higher net sales at CPW partially reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the month of March and our share of lower 
after-tax restructuring charges compared to fiscal 2019. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 
31 percent (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 
components of our joint ventures’ net sales growth are shown in the following table:

 The 9 percent decrease in Convenience Stores & Foodservice organic net sales growth in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in organic net sales growth includes a decrease in contributions from organic volume growth 
and unfavorable organic net price realization and mix. 
 
Segment operating profit decreased 20 percent to $337 million in fiscal 2020, compared to $420 million in fiscal 2019, primarily driven 
by lower contributions from volume growth and unfavorable net price realization and mix. 
 
PET SEGMENT 
 
Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in national pet superstore chains, e-
commerce retailers, grocery stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product 
categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, and vegetables and other high-
quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different 
product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures, and cuts for wet foods. 
 
Fiscal 2020 includes 13 months of Pet operating segment results as we changed the Pet operating segment’s reporting period from an 
April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. Fiscal 2019 included 12 months of results.  
 
Pet net sales were as follows: 
 
  Fiscal 2020   Fiscal 2020 vs. 2019

The 18 percent increase in Pet organic net sales growth in fiscal 2020 was driven by an increase in contributions from organic volume 
growth, including the impact of an extra month in the period, and favorable organic net price realization and mix. Fiscal 2020 organic 
net sales includes growth from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
Pet operating profit increased 46 percent to $391 million in fiscal 2020, compared to $268 million in fiscal 2019, primarily driven by a 
$53 million purchase accounting adjustment related to inventory acquired in fiscal 2019, an increase in contributions from volume 
growth, favorable net price realization and mix, and the impact of an extra month in the period, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. 
 
ASIA & LATIN AMERICA SEGMENT 
 
Our Asia & Latin America operating segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Asia and South America 
regions. Our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, meal kits, dessert and baking mixes, snack bars, 
salty snacks, refrigerated and frozen dough products, and wellness beverages. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts 
directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Our Asia & Latin America segment also includes products manufactured in the United 
States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international 
 
26 
 joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer or 
franchisee is located.

The 2 percent decrease in Asia & Latin America organic net sales in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The decrease in organic net sales growth includes unfavorable organic net price realization and mix and a decrease in 
contributions from organic volume growth. 
 
Segment operating profit decreased 74 percent to $19 million in fiscal 2020, compared to $72 million in fiscal 2019, primarily driven 
by an increase in input costs and lower contributions from volume growth. Segment operating profit decreased 73 percent on a constant-
currency basis in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of this measure not 
defined by GAAP). 
 
UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS 
 
Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, 
contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring 
initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes 
gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in 
accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
In fiscal 2020, unallocated corporate expense increased $169 million to $509 million compared to $340 million last year, primarily 
driven by compensation and benefits expenses. In fiscal 2020, we recorded a $25 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-
market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $36 million net increase in expense in the prior 
year. In addition, we recorded $26 million of restructuring charges, and $2 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost 
of sales in fiscal 2020, compared to $10 million of restructuring charges and $1 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs 
in cost of sales in fiscal 2019. We also recorded a $19 million charge related to a product recall in our international Green Giant business 
in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, we recorded $8 million of net losses related to certain investment valuation adjustments and the loss on 
sale of certain corporate investments, compared to $23 million of gains in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $16 million gain 
 
27 
 from a legal recovery related to our Yoplait SAS subsidiary and $26 million of integration costs related to our acquisition of Blue 
Buffalo. In addition, we recorded a $3 million loss related to the impact of hyperinflationary accounting for our Argentina subsidiary in 
fiscal 2019. 
 
IMPACT OF INFLATION 
 
We experienced input cost inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2020 and 4 percent in fiscal 2019, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect 
input cost inflation of approximately 3 percent in fiscal 2021. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, 
and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. 
 
LIQUIDITY 
 
The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated 
$6.5 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends. We also use 
cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-
term debt, and occasionally issue shares of common stock, to finance significant acquisitions. Our sources of liquidity were not 
materially impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
As of May 31, 2020, we had $566 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions.  As a result of the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (TCJA), the historic undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were taxed in the U.S. via the one-time repatriation tax 
in fiscal 2018.  We have re-evaluated our assertion and have concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain 
permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings. As part of 
the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we began repatriating 
undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings. As a result of the transition 
tax, we may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. 
income tax liability.

During fiscal 2020, cash provided by operations was $3,676 million compared to $2,807 million in the same period last year. The $869 
million increase was primarily driven by an $801 million change in current assets and liabilities and a $425 million increase in net 
earnings, partially offset by a $192 million change in non-cash restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs and a $123 million change 
in deferred income taxes. The $801 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $233 million change in 
other current liabilities, primarily driven by changes in income taxes payable, trade and advertising accruals, and incentive accruals, a 
$230 million change in accounts payable as a result of increased spending on raw materials and packaging as well as the continued 
extension of payment terms, and a $208 million change in prepaid and other current assets, primarily driven by the timing of certain tax 
payments and receipts. 
 
We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2020, core working capital decreased 
$591 million, compared to a net sales increase of 5 percent, primarily driven by the increase in accounts payable and lower inventory 
balances. In fiscal 2019, core working capital decreased $195 million, compared to a net sales increase of 7 percent.

Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities  $ 3.5  $ 0.2 
 
To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States 
and Europe. In response to uncertainty surrounding the availability and cost of commercial paper borrowings as a result of the COVID-
19 pandemic, we issued $750 million of fixed-rate notes in April 2020 and reduced our borrowings under commercial paper programs. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, we will continue to evaluate its impact to our sources of liquidity. We also have uncommitted and 
asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations.  
 
Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 
31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.   
 
We have $2,332 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $100 million of 6.61 
percent medium-term notes due for remarketing in October 2020, €500 million of 2.1 percent notes due November 2020, €200 million 
of 0.0 percent notes due November 2020, $4 million of floating-rate medium term notes due for remarketing in November 2020, $850 
million of floating-rate notes due April 2021, and $600 million of 3.2 percent notes due April 2021 .  We believe that cash flows from 
operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at 
least the next 12 months. 
 
As of May 31, 2020, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 87 percent in fixed-rate 
and 13 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 74 percent in fixed-rate and 26 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 26, 
2019.  
 
Our net debt to operating cash flow ratio declined to 3.2 in fiscal 2020 from 5.0 in fiscal 2019, primarily driven by an increase in cash 
provided by operations. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio declined to 3.2 in fiscal 2020 from 3.9 in fiscal 2019, consistent with 
our plans to reduce our leverage following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use 
of this measure not defined by GAAP).  
 
We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. 
Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated 
financial statements. We record Sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling 
interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and 
Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all 
or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. As of May 31, 2020, 
the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $545 million which approximates its fair value. 
 
30 
 During fiscal 2019, Sodiaal invested $56 million in Yoplait SAS.  
 
The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from 
available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the 
most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). On June 1, 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A 
Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years 
through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. 
 
We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid 
preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital 
account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to 
calculate EPS in that period. 
 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 
As of May 31, 2020, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $130 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated 
affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements were not material as of May 31, 2020. 
 
As of May 31, 2020, we invested in three variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, 
financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. 
 
Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). In the future, the 
PPA may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions 
in fiscal 2021. 
 
The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by

million for net unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts, and fair value adjustments. 
(b) See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information on our lease arrangements. 
(c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course 
of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements 
are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be 
purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant 
penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable 
and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. 
(d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty 
was $43.1 million as of May 31, 2020, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the 
amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of 
liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other 
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay approximately $24 
million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and approximately $21 million of deferred compensation in 
fiscal 2021. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2021.  As of May 31, 2020, our total 
liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $175.8 million.

 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 
of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition 
and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible 
assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and 
postemployment benefit plans. 
 
Considerations related to the COVID-19 pandemic  
The impact that the recent COVID-19 pandemic will have on our consolidated results of operations is uncertain. We saw increased 
orders from retail customers across all geographies in response to increased consumer demand for food at home. We also experienced a 
COVID-19-related decrease in consumer traffic in away-from-home food outlets during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020. 
Near-term elevated retail customer orders may unwind in the coming months, and we are unable to predict the nature and timing of 
when that impact may occur, if at all. We have considered the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in our significant accounting 
estimates as of May 31, 2020, and will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business and consolidated results 
of operations. 
 
Revenue Recognition 
Our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer 
coupon redemption and other reductions to the transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and 
prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for 
offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction price is recognized as a 
change in estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were $471 million as of May 31, 2020, 
and $410 million as of May 26, 2019. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make 
adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.  
 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets  
We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair 
value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. 
 
Intangible Assets  
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment 
testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth 
rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other 
factors.  
 
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a 
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, 
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results 
in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance 
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized 
on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is 
based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates 
that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.  
 
As of May 31, 2020, we had $20 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We assessed our goodwill and brand intangible 
assets for potential impairment indicators using quantitative and qualitative factors, including the estimated impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic, as of May 31, 2020, and concluded that no impairment indicators were present as of that date. While we currently believe 
that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, 
materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could 
result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2020 assessment of our intangible assets as of 
the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related 
fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values, except for the Europe & Australia reporting unit and the Progresso  brand 
intangible asset. 
 
 
  
 
32 
 The excess fair value as of the fiscal 2020 test date of the Europe & Australia reporting unit and the Progresso  brand intangible asset 
were as follows:  
 
In Millions Carrying Value of 
Intangible Asset   Excess Fair Value 
as of Fiscal 2020 
Test Date 
Europe & Australia  $ 672.6  14%
Progresso  $ 330.0  5%
 
In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2020 assessment date, the Pillsbury brand intangible asset had risk of 
decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor our businesses for potential impairment. 
 
Redeemable Interest 
The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value of the redeemable interest include projected revenue growth and 
profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. 
As of May 31, 2020, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $545 million. 
 
Stock-based Compensation   
The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to 
have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, 
employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 12 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 
 
 Fiscal Year 
 2020 2019  2018 
Estimated fair values of stock options granted  $ 7.10 $5.35  $6.18 
Assumptions:            
Risk-free interest rate  2.0 %  2.9 %  2.2 % 
Expected term  8.5 years   8.5 years   8.2 years 
Expected volatility  17.4 %  16.3 %  15.8 % 
Dividend yield  3.6 %  4.3 %  3.6 % 
 
The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in 
effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant 
date fair value by 1 percent.  If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2020 volatility 
assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2020 option awards by 7 percent. 
 
To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to 
final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual 
and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-
year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. 
 
Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings 
(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual 
impact on future years’ cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and 
the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously 
determined for financial reporting purposes. 
 
Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that 
significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.  
 
Income Taxes 
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize 
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in 
 
33 
 judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For 
more information on income taxes, please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans 
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United 
Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under 
certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined 
benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. 
 
We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. 
Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our 
obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net 
periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest 
rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates. 
 
Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets 
 
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our 
estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and 
long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for 
one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. 
 
Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement 
benefit plan assets were 15.4 percent, 8.5 percent, 10.1 percent, 8.2 percent, and 7.9 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods 
ended May 31, 2020. 
 
On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 6.95 percent for fiscal 2020, 7.25 percent for 
fiscal 2019, and 7.88 percent for fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2021, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets 
for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 5.67 percent due to asset allocation 
changes and expected asset returns. 
 
Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense 
by $79 million for fiscal 2021. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related 
valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or 
losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual 
return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual 
expense or income. 
 
Discount Rates 
 
We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our 
international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve 
approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash 
flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, 
and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future 
cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, 
including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows 
to determine our discount rate assumptions. 
 
 
34 
 Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: 
 
 Defined Benefit 
Pension Plans  Other 
Postretirement 
Benefit Plans  Postemployment 
Benefit Plans 
Effective rate for fiscal 2021 service costs  3.59 %  3.44 %  2.54 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2021 interest costs  2.54 %  2.32 %  1.41 % 
Obligations as of May 31, 2020  3.20 %  3.02 %  1.85 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2020 service costs  4.19 %  4.04 %  3.51 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2020 interest costs  3.47 %  3.28 %  2.84 % 
Obligations as of May 31, 2019  3.91 %  3.79 %  3.10 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2019 service costs  4.34 %  4.27 %  3.99 % 
Effective rate for fiscal 2019 interest costs  3.92 %  3.80 %  3.37 % 
 
Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and 
postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2021 by approximately $54 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses 
are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average 
remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants.  
 
Health Care Cost Trend Rates  
 
We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and 
information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and 
projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain 
consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.5 
percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.2 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2020. Rates are graded down annually 
until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the 
retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate 
the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for 
health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. 
 
Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once 
recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active 
plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” 
inactive participants. 
 
Financial Statement Impact   
 
In fiscal 2020, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income of $2 
million compared to $24 million of expense in fiscal 2019 and $23 million of expense in fiscal 2018. As of May 31, 2020, we had 
cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial 
net gains of $114 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower 
interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in 
increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. 
 
Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend 
on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the 
populations participating in these plans.

 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of time to 
ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new standard provides expedients and exceptions to existing 
accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates, 
such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be applied as of the 
beginning of the interim period including March 12, 2020, or any date thereafter, through December 31, 2022. We are in the process of 
reviewing our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate and analyzing the impact of this guidance 
on our results of operations and financial position.  
 
In December 2019, the FASB issued new accounting requirements related to income taxes. The new standard simplifies the accounting 
for income taxes by removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the recognition of deferred tax 
liabilities for outside basis differences, and the methodology for calculating income taxes in interim periods. The new standard also 
simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies accounting for transactions 
that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.  
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, 
including trade receivables. The new accounting requirements replace the incurred loss impairment model with a forward-looking 
expected credit loss model, which will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The requirements of the new standard and 
subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those 
annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 using a 
modified retrospective transition approach. We expect to record an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of 
the effective date to align our calculation of credit losses to the new model with consideration of the economic implications of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
 
NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 
We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures 
provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors.   
 
For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP 
measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful 
information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP 
measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. 
 
Several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events 
or items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating results. 
 
Organic Net Sales Growth Rates 
 
We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to our 
Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation 
purposes. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to 
underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, 
divestitures, and a 53rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net 
sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Segment 
Operations discussions in the MD&A above.  
 
Adjusted Diluted EPS and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate   
 
This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our 
performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is 
the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis.

Constant-currency After-Tax Earnings from Joint Ventures Growth Rate 
 
We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance of

HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
 
This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation 
Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectations and assumptions. We also may make written or oral forward-looking 
statements, including statements contained in our filings with the SEC and in our reports to shareholders. 
 
The words or phrases “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” or similar 
expressions identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such 
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and

43 
 In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important 
factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from any 
current opinions or statements. 
 
Our future results could be affected by a variety of factors, such as: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, suppliers, 
consumers, customers, and employees; disruptions or inefficiencies in the supply chain, including any impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic; competitive dynamics in the consumer foods industry and the markets for our products, including new product introductions, 
advertising activities, pricing actions, and promotional activities of our competitors; economic conditions, including changes in inflation 
rates, interest rates, tax rates, or the availability of capital; product development and innovation; consumer acceptance of new products 
and product improvements; consumer reaction to pricing actions and changes in promotion levels; acquisitions or dispositions of 
businesses or assets, changes in capital structure; changes in the legal and regulatory environment, including tax legislation, labeling 
and advertising regulations, and litigation; impairments in the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets, or other long-lived 
assets, or changes in the useful lives of other intangible assets; changes in accounting standards and the impact of significant accounting 
estimates; product quality and safety issues, including recalls and product liability; changes in consumer demand for our products; 
effectiveness of advertising, marketing, and promotional programs; changes in consumer behavior, trends, and preferences, including 
weight loss trends; consumer perception of health-related issues, including obesity; consolidation in the retail environment; changes in 
purchasing and inventory levels of significant customers; fluctuations in the cost and availability of supply chain resources, including 
raw materials, packaging, and energy; effectiveness of restructuring and cost saving initiatives; volatility in the market value of 
derivatives used to manage price risk for certain commodities; benefit plan expenses due to changes in plan asset values and discount 
rates used to determine plan liabilities; failure or breach of our information technology systems; foreign economic conditions, including 
currency rate fluctuations; and political unrest in foreign markets and economic uncertainty due to terrorism or war. 
 
You should also consider the risk factors that we identify in Item 1A of this report, which could also affect our future results. 
 
We undertake no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those 
statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 
 
ITEM 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 
We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes 
in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our 
exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that place clear 
controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for 
each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For information 
on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
VALUE AT RISK 
 
The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse 
changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte 
Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market 
conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. 
 
The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate 
the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data set. The 
calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the 
derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives 
would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in the 
calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures, and options; and equity 
instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related positions that are offset 
by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.  
 
  
 
44 
 The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign 
currency, commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 31, 2020 and May 26, 2019, and the average 
fair value impact during the year ended May 31, 2020.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
General Mills, Inc.: 
 
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 31, 
2020 and May 26, 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable interest, 
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule 
II (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting 
as of May 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
the Company as of May 31, 2020 and May 26, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in 
the three-year period ended May 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the 
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020 based on criteria 
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission. 
 
Change in Accounting Principle  
 
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of May 
27, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , and related amendments.  
 
Basis for Opinions 
 
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over 
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are 
a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required 
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures 
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits 
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
 
47 
 or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements. 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
Critical Audit Matter 
 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements 
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are 
material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The 
communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, 
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the 
accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
Evaluation of valuation of goodwill and brands and other indefinite-lived intangible assets  
 
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill and brand and other indefinite-lived intangibles 
balances as of May 31, 2020 were $13,923.2 million and $6,561.4 million, respectively. The impairment tests for these assets, 
which are performed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred, 
require the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned as well as the brand and 
other indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow analyses that require 
the Company to make judgments about highly subjective matters, including future operating results, including revenue growth 
rates and operating margins, and an estimate of the discount rates and royalty rates.  
 
We identified the evaluation of valuation of goodwill and brands and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as a critical audit 
matter. There was a significant degree of judgment required in evaluating audit evidence, which consists primarily of forward 
looking assumptions about future operating results, specifically the revenue growth rates, operating margins, royalty rates and 
subjective inputs used to estimate the discount rates. 
 
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the design and 
tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the 
assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure the reporting unit and brand and 
other intangible fair values. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates, operating margins, brand royalty 
rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential assumptions. We evaluated the revenue 
growth rates and operating margin assumptions by comparing them to recent financial performance and external market and 
industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 
Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rates and 
royalty rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data 
for comparable entities.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS 
 
Basis of Presentation 
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling 
financial interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those 
transactions, are eliminated in consolidation. 
 
Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal year 2020 consisted of 53 weeks, while fiscal years 2019 and 2018 consisted of 
52 weeks. 
 
Certain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. 
See Note 2 for additional information.  
 
Change in Reporting Period   
As part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2020 we changed the reporting period of our 
Pet segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, our fiscal 2020 results 
include 13 months of Pet segment results compared to 12 months in fiscal 2019. The impact of this change was not material to our 
consolidated results of operations and, therefore, we did not restate prior period financial statements for comparability. Our India 
business is on an April fiscal year end.  
 
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents   
We consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
 
Inventories   
All inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. 
Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net 
changes in value recorded in earnings currently. 
 
Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net 
realizable value. 
 
Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized 
when the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer. 
 
Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation   
Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded 
at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are 
charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated 
over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or retired, the 
accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized in 
earnings. As of May 31, 2020, assets held for sale were insignificant. 
 
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an 
asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable 
cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the 
carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or independent 
appraisals, as appropriate. 
 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   
Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of the 
first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying 
value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated 
 
54 
 with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the 
carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount 
by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting 
unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined 
using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market 
comparables, and other factors.  
 
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a 
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, 
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results 
in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance 
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized 
on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. 
 
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue Buffalo , Pillsbury , Totino’s, Yoplait, 
Old El Paso , Progresso , Annie’s, Häagen-Dazs , and Yoki brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based 
on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that 
could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.  
 
Our finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss 
would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the 
carrying amount of the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of 
an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a 
discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.  
 
Leases 
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. When our lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components, 
we account for lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.  
 
Any lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and we recognize 
lease costs for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of our lease arrangements provide us with 
options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement. We include these options when we are reasonably 
certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, our lease agreements 
do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants. 
 
We have certain lease arrangements with variable rental payments. Our lease arrangements for our Häagen-Dazs retail shops often 
include rental payments that are based on a percentage of retail sales. We have other lease arrangements that are adjusted periodically 
based on an inflation index or rate. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown, and therefore they are not 
included as minimum lease payments used to determine our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Variable rental payments are 
recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.  
 
As most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, we apply an incremental borrowing rate based on the 
information available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments. 
 
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  
Our investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of 
undistributed earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and 
development), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make 
advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and 
finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices. 
 
In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, 
but not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of 
capital, or significant business disruptions.  The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and 
profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. By their nature, 
these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the 
carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the 
 
55 
 investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary. 
 
Redeemable Interest 
We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 
percent interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, 
up to three times before December 2024. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of 
equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the 
redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the 
redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s 
redemption value, which approximates its fair value. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include 
projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange 
rates, and a discount rate. 
 
Revenue Recognition   
Our revenues primarily result from contracts with customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation 
– the delivery of product. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation 
has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by 
our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable consideration and 
consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption and other reductions to the transaction 
price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise 
taxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance 
levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated and actual reductions to the transaction price are 
recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-
case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable 
condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Payment terms and collection 
patterns vary around the world and by channel, and are short-term, and as such, we do not have any significant financing components. 
Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, as 
determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance 
when we deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 17 for a disaggregation of our revenue into categories that depict how the 
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. We do not have material contract 
assets or liabilities arising from our contracts with customers. 
 
Environmental Costs   
Environmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are 
expensed. Liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably 
estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action. 
 
Advertising Production Costs   
We expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place. 
 
Research and Development   
All expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures 
for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, 
consulting, and supplies attributable to R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including 
assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation   
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated 
at the period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. 
Translation adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses 
from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries 
for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net 
investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. 
 
Derivative Instruments   
All derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their 
fair value, and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of 
derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as 
a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are reclassified 
 
56 
 to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts 
reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time.  
 
Stock-based Compensation   
We generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value of a share 
of our stock on the date of grant. We estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Generally, stock-
based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in selling, 
general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated to each 
reportable segment in our segment results. 
 
Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of 
eligible employees and directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s or director’s retention of the award 
is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is generally recognized immediately 
for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, 
if less than the stated vesting period. 
 
We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow. 
 
Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans   
We sponsor several domestic and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired 
employees. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. 
Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of 
service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. 
 
We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in 
the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI. 
 
Use of Estimates   
Preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These 
estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-
based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans. Actual 
results could differ from our estimates. 
 
New Accounting Standards  
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the annual disclosure requirements for defined 
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The new standard modifies specific disclosures to improve usefulness to financial 
statement users. We adopted the requirements of the new standard using a retrospective approach. The adoption of this guidance did not 
impact our results of operations or financial position.  
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted new accounting requirements for hedge accounting. The new standard amends the hedge 
accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting. The 
new standard also simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results 
of operations or financial position. 
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted new requirements for the accounting, presentation, and classification of leases. This results 
in certain leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We performed a 
review of our lease portfolio, implemented lease accounting software, and developed a centralized business process with corresponding 
controls. We adopted this guidance utilizing the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which required application of the guidance at 
the adoption date, and elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including not reassessing whether 
existing contracts contain leases and carrying forward the historical classification of those leases. In addition, we elected not to recognize 
leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and to continue our historical treatment of land 
easements, under permitted elections. This guidance did not have a material impact on retained earnings, our Consolidated Statements 
of Earnings, or our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information on the impact to our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 
57 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit 
pension expense, net periodic postretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense (collectively “net 
periodic benefit expense”). The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the 
same line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net 
periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, 
the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. The new 
standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective application of the 
capitalization of the service cost component. The impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations was a decrease to 
our operating profit of $87.9 million and $89.4 million and a corresponding increase to benefit plan non-service income of $87.9 million 
and $89.4 million for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. There were no changes to our reported segment operating profit. 
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. 
Under the new standard, we apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised 
goods to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. 
We did not identify any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we 
did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure 
requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments to all contracts in 
the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the cumulative effect approach. We recorded a $33.9 million cumulative effect adjustment net of 
income tax effects to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to deferred income taxes of $11.4 million, and an 
increase to other current liabilities of $45.3 million related to the timing of recognition of certain promotional expenditures. 
 
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that codify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, as it relates to allowing for recognition of provisional amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act (TCJA) in the event that the accounting is not complete and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where necessary information is not 
available, prepared, or analyzed to determine a reasonable estimate, no provisional amount should be recorded. The guidance allows for 
a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting related to the TCJA.  In fiscal 2019, we 
completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. 
 
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax 
effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA 
of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained earnings. This reclassification consisted of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that 
exceeded the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The new accounting requirements allowed for adjustments to reclassification 
amounts in subsequent periods as a result of changes to the provisional amounts recorded. 
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments. The 
adoption of this guidance resulted in the prospective recognition of realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or 
vesting of stock-based awards in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings instead of additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. We retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of realized windfall tax benefits, which resulted in 
reclassifications of cash provided by financing activities to operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Additionally, we retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of employee tax withholdings, which resulted in 
reclassifications of cash used by operating activities to financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Stock-based 
compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures. 
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill 
impairment loss by the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Previously, goodwill 
impairment losses were required to be measured by determining the implied fair value of goodwill. The adoption of this guidance did 
not impact our results of operations or financial position. 
 
NOTE 3. DIVESTITURES 
 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salteña fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in Argentina, and recorded a 
pre-tax loss of $35.4 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our yogurt business in China and simultaneously entered 
into a new Yoplait license agreement with the purchaser for their use of the Yoplait brand. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $5.4 million.

 NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS  
 
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS 
 
In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $192.6 million charge related to the impairment of our Progresso , Food Should Taste Good , and Mountain 
High brand intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. 
 
In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $14.8 million charge in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs related to the impairment of certain 
manufacturing assets in our North America Retail and Asia & Latin America segments. 
 
In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $96.9 million charge related to the impairment of our Yoki, Mountain High , and Immaculate Baking  brand 
intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. 
 
RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES 
 
We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal 
rate of return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as 
each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. 
These activities result in various restructuring costs, including asset write-offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination 
fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets, as used in the context of our 
disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating 
the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. Any 
impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved. 
 
In fiscal 2020, we did not undertake any new restructuring actions and recorded $50.2 million of restructuring charges for previously 
announced restructuring actions.  
 
In fiscal 2019, we recorded $77.6 million of restructuring charges primarily related to approved restructuring actions to drive efficiencies 
in targeted areas of our global supply chain. In fiscal 2020, we increased the estimate of expected severance charges by $3 million and 
decreased the estimate of other exit costs related to these actions by $4 million. We now expect to spend a total of approximately $24 
million of cash related to these actions. Certain actions are subject to union negotiations and works counsel consultations, where required. 
We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2022. The remaining expense to be incurred is approximately $8 million 
of other exit costs.  
 
We paid net $6.6 million of cash related to restructuring actions previously announced in fiscal 2020, compared to $49.3 million in fiscal 
2019. 
 
Charges recorded in fiscal 2019 were as follows:

expense (e.g., asset impairment charges, the gain or loss on the sale of restructured assets, and the write-off of spare parts) and other 
periodic exit costs recognized as incurred, as those items are not reflected in our restructuring and other exit cost reserves on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test was performed on the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 
2020, and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the 
carrying values, except for the Europe & Australia reporting unit and the Progresso  brand intangible asset.  
  
The excess fair values as of the fiscal 2020 test date of the Europe & Australia reporting unit and the Progresso brand intangible asset 
were as follows:  
 
In Millions Carrying Value of 
Intangible Asset  Excess Fair Value as of 
Fiscal 2020 Test Date

Progresso  $ 330.0 5% 
 
In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2020 assessment date, the Pillsbury brand intangible asset had risk of 
decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment. 
 
We did not identify any indicators of impairment, including impacts of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, for any goodwill or indefinite-
lived intangible assets as of May 31, 2020. 
 
In fiscal 2019, as a result of lower sales projections in our long-range plans for the businesses supporting the Progresso , Food Should 
Taste Good , and Mountain High  brand intangible assets, we  recorded a $192.6 million impairment charge in restructuring, impairment, 
and other exit costs. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $96.9 million charge related to the impairment of our Yoki, Mountain High , and 
Immaculate Baking  brand intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. Significant assumptions used in these 
 
62 
 assessments included our long-range cash flow projections for the businesses, royalty rates, weighted-average cost of capital rates, and 
tax rates.

securities. There were no realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2019. Gains and losses are determined by 
specific identification. Classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent is dependent upon our intended holding period 
and the security’s maturity date. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax effects, are 
classified in AOCI within stockholders’ equity.

a foreign uncommitted line of credit. 
 
The fair value and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $14,538.4 million and $13,260.5 million, 
respectively, as of May 31, 2020. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows 
based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level 2 liability in the fair value 
hierarchy. 
 
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 
 
As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and 
commodity and equity prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) 
pursuant to our established policies. 
 
 
64 
 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 
Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives 
to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), 
dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty 
with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination 
of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. 
We offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our 
planned cost as possible. 
 
We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve 
hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently 
in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
 
Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our 
objective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of 
measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment 
operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from 
unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the derivative 
without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.  
 
Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 included: 
 
 Fiscal Year 
In Millions 2020 2019 2018
Net (loss) gain on mark -to-market valuation of commodity positions  $(63.0) $(39.0)$14.3

   corporate items to segment operating profit  35.6  10.0 11.3

Net mark -to-market valuation of certain commodity positions  
   recognized in unallocated corporate items  $ (24.7) $(36.0)$32.1 
 
As of May 31, 2020, the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $234.5 million, of which $159.4 million related to agricultural 
inputs and $75.1 million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 
months.  
 
INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-
rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. 
We use interest rate swaps, forward-starting interest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to 
reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate debt, based on current 
and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-
rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. 
 
Floating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of 
forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes 
in the present value of interest payments on the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into 
earnings over the life of the associated debt.  
 
Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed 
based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and derivatives, using incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans 
with similar terms and maturities.  
 
In advance of planned debt financing, we entered into $750.0 million notional amount of treasury locks due April 2, 2020 with an 
average fixed rate of 0.67 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $1.4 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, 
concurrent with the issuance of our $750.0 million 10-year fixed rate notes. 
 
65 
 In advance of planned debt financing, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we entered into $300.0 million notional amount of treasury 
locks due January 13, 2022 with an average fixed rate of 0.85 percent.  
  
During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we entered into a €600.0 million notional amount interest rate swap to convert our €600.0 million 
fixed rate notes due January 15, 2026, to a floating rate.   
  
During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we entered into a $500.0 million notional amount interest rate swap to convert a portion of our 
$850.0 million floating-rate notes due April 16, 2021, to a fixed rate.  
 
As of May 31, 2020, the pre-tax amount of cash-settled interest rate hedge gain or loss remaining in AOCI, which will be reclassified 
to earnings over the remaining term of the related underlying debt, follows:

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK 
 
Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party 
purchases, intercompany loans, product shipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign 
currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian 
dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to 
selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign-denominated commercial paper 
borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity with foreign 
exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings 
on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance. 
 
As of May 31, 2020, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $967.2 million. 
 
 
66 
 We also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net 
investments by issuing euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 31, 2020, we hedged a 
portion of these net investments with €2,200.0 million of euro denominated bonds.  As of May 31, 2020, we had deferred net foreign 
currency transaction losses of $29.9 million in AOCI associated with net investment hedging activity. 
 
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS  
 
Equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation 
plan are revalued. We use equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May 31, 2020, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was 
$146.9 million. These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2021.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES 
 
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from 
each of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments 
could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative 
instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on May 31, 2020, was $31.4 million. We have 
posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered 
on May 31, 2020, we would have been required to post $31.4 million of collateral to counterparties.

No customer other than Walmart accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. 
 
We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly 
rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the 
amount of credit exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by 
these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through various 
regulated exchanges. 
 
The amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the 
contracts, is $14.2 million, against which we do not hold collateral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions 
require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. 
Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty 
defaults. 
 
We offer certain suppliers access to third party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments online. The third party services 
also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. We have 
no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers, the third parties, or any financial 
institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier 
agreements. As of May 31, 2020, $1,328.9 million of our accounts payable is payable to suppliers who utilize these third party services.

Certain of our long-term debt agreements contain restrictive covenants. As of May 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of these 
covenants.  
 
As of May 31, 2020, the $35.7 million pre-tax loss recorded in AOCI associated with our previously designated interest rate swaps will 
be reclassified to net interest over the remaining lives of the hedged transactions. The amount expected to be reclassified from AOCI to 
net interest in fiscal 2021 is a $9.4 million pre-tax loss. 
 
NOTE 10. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
 
Our principal redeemable and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl, and 
General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we have 4 foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling 
$4.7 million as of May 31, 2020. 
 
73 
 We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. 
Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4 million fair value of 
Sodiaal’s 49 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal 
has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. 
We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the 
redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends annually if it meets certain 
financial metrics set forth in its shareholders’ agreement. As of May 31, 2020, the redemption value of the euro-denominated redeemable 
interest was $544.6 million.  
 
On the acquisition dates, we recorded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait Marques 
SNC and 50 percent Canadian dollar-denominated interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. Yoplait Marques SNC earns a royalty stream through a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights 
to Yoplait and related trademarks. Liberté Marques Sàrl earns a royalty stream through licensing agreements with certain Yoplait group 
companies for the rights to Liberté and related trademarks. These entities pay dividends annually based on their available cash as of 
their fiscal year end.  
 
We paid dividends of $56.9 million in fiscal 2020 and $22.0 million in fiscal 2019 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS, Yoplait 
Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl shareholder agreements. 
 
A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal at market-
determined prices through July 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $201.8 million for fiscal 2020 and $210.8 million for fiscal 2019. 
 
During fiscal 2019, Sodiaal invested $55.7 million in Yoplait SAS. 
 
The holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application 
of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation 
(currently $251.5 million). On June 1, 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A interests was reset to the sum of three-
month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points.  The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the 
Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. 
 
For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non-wholly owned consolidated 
subsidiaries are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third-party investor’s share of the net earnings of these 
subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of 
Earnings.  
 
Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. 
 
NOTE 11. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY 
 
Cumulative preference stock of 5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued. 
 
On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under 
the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other 
derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination 
date. 
 
On March 27, 2018, we issued 22.7 million shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.10 per share, at a public offering price 
of $44.00 per share for total proceeds of $1.0 billion. We paid $30.1 million in issuance costs that were recorded in additional paid-in 
capital. The net proceeds of $969.9 million were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (“Blue 
Buffalo”).

AOCI to retained earnings.  Please see Note 15 for additional information.  
 
NOTE 12. STOCK PLANS 
 
We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 31, 
2020, a total of 26.4 million shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and 
shares of unrestricted stock under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan (2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-
settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, and performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include 
some granted under the 2009 and 2011 stock plans and the 2006 and 2011 compensation plans for non-employee directors, under which 
no further awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for potential accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or 
death of eligible employees and directors.  
 
 
76 
 Stock Options 
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 
 
 Fiscal Year 
 2020 2019  2018 
Estimated fair values of stock options granted  $ 7.10 $5.35  $6.18 
Assumptions:            
Risk-free interest rate  2.0 %  2.9 %  2.2 % 
Expected term  8.5 years   8.5 years   8.2 years 
Expected volatility  17.4 %  16.3 %  15.8 % 
Dividend yield  3.6 %  4.3 %  3.6 % 
 
We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make 
predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We 
estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of 
volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did 
not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 
6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. 
 
Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate 
option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise 
behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee 
groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. 
Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
 
Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings 
(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized 
windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the 
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. We recognized windfall tax benefits from stock-based payments in income tax expense in our 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings of $27.3 million in fiscal 2020, $24.5 million in fiscal 2019, and $25.5 million in fiscal 2018.  
 
Options may be priced at 100 percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date 
of grant. Options generally expire within 10 years and one month after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Units 
Stock and units settled in stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the Compensation Committee 
of the Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2017 Plan. Restricted stock and restricted stock units generally 
vest and become unrestricted four years after the date of grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based on our future 
achievement of three-year goals for average organic net sales growth and cumulative free cash flow. Performance share units are settled 
in common stock and are generally subject to a three year performance and vesting period. The sale or transfer of these awards is 
restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding restricted stock, but not restricted stock units or performance share units, are 
entitled to vote on matters submitted to holders of common stock for a vote. These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, 
but participants only receive payment if the awards vest.

NOTE 14. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
 
Defined Benefit Pension Plans  
 
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United 
Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees 
include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable 
laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019. We do not expect to be required to 
make any contributions in fiscal 2021. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any 
excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. All 
salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension 
plan.  
 
In fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension 
plans that resulted in the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan 
and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The 
benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension 
Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, the 
Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional 
flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan and the 
Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated 
with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants.   
 
 
  
 
79 
 Other Postretirement Benefit Plans  
 
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United 
States salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund 
related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2020 or 
fiscal 2019. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2021.

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and 
information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and 
projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain 
consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.5 
percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.2 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2020. Rates are graded down annually 
until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the 
retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate 
the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for 
health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. 
 
Postemployment Benefit Plans  
 
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. 
Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years 
of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

During fiscal 2020, the increase in defined benefit pension benefit obligations was primarily driven by actuarial losses due to a decrease 
in the discount rate and an update in mortality rates. The decrease in other postretirement obligations was primarily driven by a decrease 
in expected future claims, partially offset by losses due to a decrease in the discount rate. 
 
During fiscal 2019, the increase in defined benefit pension benefit obligations was primarily driven by actuarial losses due to a decrease 
in the discount rate. The decrease in other postretirement obligations was primarily driven by a decrease in expected future claims, 
partially offset by losses due to a decrease in the discount rate. 
 
As of May 31, 2020, other postretirement benefit plans had benefit obligations of $479.4 million that exceeded plan assets of $248.0 
million. As of May 26, 2019, other postretirement benefit plans had benefit obligations of $498.4 million that exceeded plan assets of 
$233.7 million. Postemployment benefit plans are not funded and had benefit obligations of $150.3 million and $128.0 million as of 
May 31, 2020 and May 26, 2019, respectively. 
 
The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $7,285.2 million as of May 31, 2020, and $6,436.9 million

Discount Rates 
 
We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our 
international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve 
approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash 
flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, 
and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May 31 to determine defined benefit pension, other 
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our outside 
actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median 
corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward 
interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

There were no material changes in our level 3 investments in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. 
 
Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets 
 
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our 
estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and 
long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for 
one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to 
participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined 
benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, 
the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, 
the long-term investment policy allocation is: 17 percent to equities in the United States; 11 percent to international equities; 9 percent 
to private equities; 50 percent to fixed income; and 13 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and infrastructure).  For other U.S. 
postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 18 percent to equities in the United States; 10 percent to 
international equities; 4 percent to private equities; 65 percent to fixed income; and 3 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and 
timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market 
valuations. 
 
Contributions and Future Benefit Payments 
 
We do not expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment 
benefit plans in fiscal 2021. Actual fiscal 2021 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to 
undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which 
reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2030 as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans  
 
The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, nonunion, and certain union 
employees. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, including a Company stock fund and an 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net 
assets of $20.6 million as of May 31, 2020, and $22.3 million as of May 26, 2019. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in many 
of our foreign locations. Our total recognized expense related to defined contribution plans was $90.1 million in fiscal 2020, $52.7 
million in fiscal 2019, and $49.2 million in fiscal 2018. 
 
We match a percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is directed to investment 
options of the participant’s choosing. The number of shares of our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was 4.6 million 
as of May 31, 2020, and 5.1 million as of May 26, 2019. The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash balances.

 The Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held $464.8 million and $410.1 million of Company common stock as of May 31, 
2020, and May 26, 2019, respectively.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law.  The CARES Act and 
related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments and estimated income tax 
payments that we expect to defer to future periods. We expect the deferral of certain payroll tax payments to continue into fiscal 2021. 
We do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective 
tax rate or on our liquidity.  We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries 
may have on our business and financial results. 
 
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA resulted in significant revisions to the U.S. corporate income tax 
system, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and a one-time deemed 
repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings. As a result of the TCJA, we recorded a provisional benefit of $523.5 million during fiscal 
2018.  During fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7.2 million which 
included adjustments to the transition tax and the measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability.  While our accounting for the 
recorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete, these amounts were based on prevailing regulations and currently available 
information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the aforementioned amounts in 
future periods. 
 
The legislation also included provisions that affected our fiscal 2019 and forward results, including but not limited to: a reduction in the 
U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision 
that taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well as currently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income 
or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the 
deductibility of certain executive compensation.   
 
As of May 31, 2020, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our 
foreign operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely or the earnings 
will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these 
reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no 
longer indefinitely reinvested.  As a result of the TCJA, we re-evaluated our assertion and have concluded that although earnings prior 
to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal 
2018 earnings. As part of the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from 
which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings.  
 
We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years 
may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the 
timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely 
outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any 
particular position would usually require the use of cash. 
 
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdiction is the United States 
(federal and state). Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which 
vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years.     
 
Several state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on 
our results of operations or financial position.  We have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior. 
 
During fiscal 2017, the Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits of our 2012 and 2013 
tax return years. These audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition 
of Yoki Alimentos S.A. The RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this 
transaction. During fiscal 2020, we received proposed adjustments related to the goodwill amortization benefits for our 2014 and 2015 
tax return years. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to contest the disallowance. 
 
 
88 
 We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize 
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in 
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.  
 
The following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2020 
and fiscal 2019. Approximately $79.3 million of this total in fiscal 2020 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our 
effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because 
certain of the liabilities below would impact deferred taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes 
upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

As of May 31, 2020, we expect to pay approximately $0.1 million of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and accrued interest within the 
next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the 
timing of tax audit outcomes. The remaining amount of our unrecognized tax liability was classified in other liabilities. 
 
We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For fiscal 2020, we 
recognized $3.2 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $27.9 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 31, 
2020. For fiscal 2019, we recognized $0.5 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $26.0 million of accrued interest and 
penalties as of May 26, 2019. 
 
NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
 
As of May 31, 2020, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $129.8 million for the debt and other obligations of non-
consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. Off-balance sheet arrangements were not material as of May 31, 2020. 
 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we received notice from the tax authorities of the State of São Paulo, Brazil regarding our 
compliance with its state sales tax requirements. As a result, we have been assessed additional state sales taxes, interest, and penalties. 
We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this claim and will vigorously defend our position. As of May 31, 2020 , we are 
unable to estimate any possible loss and have not recorded a loss contingency for this matter. 
 
NOTE 17. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  
 
We operate in the packaged foods industry. Our operating segments are as follows: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & 
Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. 
 
Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership 
stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce grocery providers. Our product categories in this business 
segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, 
frozen pizza and pizza snacks, snack bars, fruit snacks, savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including ready-to-eat 
cereal, frozen and shelf-stable vegetables, meal kits, fruit snacks, snack bars, and refrigerated yogurt. 
 
Our Europe & Australia operating segment reflects retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Europe and Australia regions. Our 
product categories include refrigerated yogurt, meal kits, snack bars, super-premium ice cream, refrigerated and frozen dough products, 
shelf stable vegetables, and dessert and baking mixes. Revenues from franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the 
franchisee is located. 
 
 
89 
 Our major product categories in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice operating segment are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated 
yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and bakery flour. Many products we sell are 
branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels 
including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries in the United States. 
 
Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in national pet superstore chains, e-
commerce retailers, grocery stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product 
categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, and vegetables and other high-
quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different 
product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures, and cuts for wet foods. 
 
Fiscal 2020 includes 13 months of Pet operating segment results as we changed the Pet operating segment’s reporting period from an 
April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. Fiscal 2019 included 12 months of results.  
 
Our Asia & Latin America operating segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Asia and South America 
regions. Our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, meal kits, dessert and baking mixes, snack bars, 
salty snacks, refrigerated and frozen dough products, and wellness beverages. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts 
directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Our Asia & Latin America segment also includes products manufactured in the United 
States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international 
joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer or 
franchisee is located. 
 
Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, 
and other exit costs. Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned North American employee 
benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary 
economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating 
performance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-
to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit 
are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive 
management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated 
across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization 
expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we changed the reporting period of our Pet segment from an April fiscal year end to a May 
fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter results include 4 months of Pet segment results 
compared to 3 months in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 also included an additional week of results

 across all other segments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded $19.3 million of expense due to a product recall related to 
our international Green Giant business and $11.5 million of restructuring charges. 
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our yogurt business in China and simultaneously entered into a new Yoplait license 
agreement with the purchaser for their use of the Yoplait brand. We recorded a gain of $5.4 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, 
we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $7.4 million. We recorded $4.3 million of integration costs related to the acquisition 
of Blue Buffalo and $9.8 million of gains related to an investment valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  We also 
recorded a tax benefit of $72.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  Please see Note 15 for more information.

 Glossary  
 
Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets. The increase in depreciation expense caused by updating the salvage 
value and shortening the useful life of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring 
plan, but only if impairment is not present. 
 
AOCI. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  
 
Adjusted diluted EPS. Diluted EPS adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.  
 
Adjusted EBITDA. The calculation of earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures, net interest, and 
depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.  
 
Adjusted operating profit. Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability. 
 
Adjusted operating profit margin. Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability, divided by net 
sales. 
 
Constant currency.  Financial results translated to United States dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the 
rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies 
other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding 
period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign 
currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange 
rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. 
 
Core working capital. Accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, all as of the last day of our fiscal year. 
 
COVID-19. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. In March 2020, the 
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. 
 
Derivatives. Financial instruments such as futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts that we use to manage our risk arising from 
changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. 
 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The calculation of earnings before income taxes and 
after-tax earnings from joint ventures, net interest, depreciation and amortization. 
 
Euribor. European Interbank Offered Rate. 
 
Fair value hierarchy. For purposes of fair value measurement, we categorize assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on the 
assumptions (inputs) used in valuing the asset or liability. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 
generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows: 
 
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2:  Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in 
active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets. 
 
Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, 
as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act. The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable 
assurance to our management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial 
statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020. In making 
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) . 
 
Based on our assessment using the criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) , management 
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2020.

control over financial reporting.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
The following description of our Common Stock and our cumulative preference stock is a summary and does not purport to 
be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of 
Incorporation”) and our By-laws, as amended (the “By-laws”), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our most 
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, our By-laws and the applicable 
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”) for additional information.
General
Our Certificate of Incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of one billion shares of our Common stock, par value $0.10

Dividend Rights
The holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors out of funds 
legally available for that purpose, provided that if any shares of preference stock are at the time outstanding, the payment of dividends 
on Common Stock or other distributions (including purchases of Common Stock) may be subject to the declaration and payment of 
full cumulative dividends, and the absence of overdue amounts in any mandatory sinking fund, on outstanding shares of preference 
stock.
Voting Rights
The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters voted on by stockholders, including the 
election of directors, subject to the voting rights of any preference stock then outstanding. The holders of Common Stock are not 
entitled to cumulative voting of their shares in the election of directors. Directors are to be elected by a majority of the votes cast by 
the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy, provided that if the number of nominees 
standing for election at any meeting of the stockholders exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors will be elected by

with voting, conversion and other rights that could proportionately reduce, minimize or otherwise adversely affect the voting power

General
We issued €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes on November 15, 2013, €500,000,000 aggregate 
principal amount of our 2023 Notes and €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes on April 27, 2015, and 
€600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes on January 15, 2020. The 2020 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 
Notes are listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “GIS20,” “GIS23A,” “GIS26” and 
“GIS27,” respectively. As of May 31, 2020, €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, €500,000,000 aggregate 
principal amount of the 2023 Notes, €600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes and €400,000,000 aggregate 
principal amount of the 2027 Notes were outstanding.
The Notes were each issued as a separate series of securities under the Indenture. The Notes and the Indenture are governed 
by, and are to be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed 
wholly within the State of New York.
Interest and Maturity
The 2020 Notes will mature on November 16, 2020, the 2023 Notes will mature on April 27, 2023, the 2026 Notes will 
mature on January 15, 2026, and the 2027 Notes will mature on April 27, 2027. We will pay interest on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 
2.100% per year annually in arrears on November 16 of each year to holders of record on the preceding November 1. We will pay 
interest on the 2023 Notes at the rate of 1.000% per year annually in arrears on April 27 of each year, beginning April 27, 2016, to 
holders of record on the preceding April 12. We will pay interest on the 2026 Notes at the rate of 0.450% per year annually in arrears 
on January 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2021, to holders of record on the preceding January 1. We will pay interest on the 
2027 Notes at the rate of 1.500% per year annually in arrears on April 27 of each year, beginning April 27, 2016, to holders of record 
on the preceding April 12. Interest payments for the 2020 Notes include accrued interest from and including November 15, 2013 or 
from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to but excluding the 
interest payment date or the date of maturity, as the case may be. Interest payments for the 2023 and 2027 Notes include accrued 
interest from and including April 27, 2015 or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided 
for, as the case may be, to but excluding the next interest payment date or the date of maturity, as the case may be. Interest payments 
for the 2026 Notes include accrued interest from and including January 15, 2020 or from and including the last date in respect of 
which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to but excluding the interest payment date or the date of maturity, as 
the case may be. Interest payable at the maturity of the Notes will be payable to the registered holders of the Notes to whom the 
principal is payable.
Interest on the Notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated 
and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes, to but excluding the next 
scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of 
the International Capital Market Association. If any interest payment date on the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the 
interest payment will be postponed to the next day that is a business day, and no interest on that payment will accrue for the period 
from and after the interest payment date. If the maturity date of the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of 
interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period 
from and after the maturity date.
“Business day” means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is not a day on which banking institutions are 
authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close in the City of New York or London and on which the Trans-European 
Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates.
Payments in Euro
All payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, is payable in euro. If the 
euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no 
longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the 
settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the 
Notes will be made in dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. The amount payable on any date in euro is converted 
into dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euro. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in 
dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture governing the Notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying 
agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.
Issuance of Additional Notes
We may, without the consent of the holders of Notes, issue additional Notes having the same ranking and the same interest 
rate, maturity and other terms as a series of the Notes (except for the public offering price and issue date and, in some cases, the first 
interest payment date). Any additional Notes, together with the Notes with the same terms, will constitute a single series of Notes 
under the Indenture; provided that, if the additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes in this offering for United States federal 
income tax purposes, the additional Notes will have different ISIN and CUSIP numbers. No additional Notes of a series may be issued 
if an event of default has occurred with respect to that series of Notes.
Ranking
The Notes are our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes rank equal in priority with all of our existing and 
future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated 
indebtedness. The Notes effectively rank junior to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the 
assets securing such indebtedness. In addition, because the Notes are only our obligation and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries, 
creditors of each of our subsidiaries, including trade creditors and owners of preferred equity of our subsidiaries, generally will have 
priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes. The 
Notes, therefore, are effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors, including trade creditors, of our subsidiaries, and to claims of 
owners of preferred equity of our subsidiaries. 
Redemption
As discussed below, we may redeem the Notes before they mature. The Notes to be redeemed will stop bearing interest on 
the redemption date. We will give holders of Notes between 15 and 45 days’ notice before the redemption date.
We are not required (i) to register, transfer or exchange the Notes during the period from the opening of business 15 days 
before the day a notice of redemption relating to the Notes selected for redemption is sent to the close of business on the day that 
notice is sent, or (ii) to register, transfer or exchange any Notes so selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any 
Notes being redeemed in part.
We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time. The redemption price for the 2020 Notes to 
be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to August 16, 2020 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be 
equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the 
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2020 Notes to be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of 
interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at 
the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below), plus 15 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid 
interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the 2020 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after

Notes being redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes to the date of redemption. The 
redemption price for the 2023 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to January 27, 2023 (the date that is three 
months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed 
and (2) as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled 
payments of principal and interest on the 2023 notes to be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of 
the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable 
Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date 
of redemption. The redemption price for the 2023 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after January 27, 2023 
(the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes being 
redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2023 Notes to the date of redemption. The redemption price 
for the 2026 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to October 15, 2025 (the date that is three months prior to the 
maturity date) will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined 
by an independent investment bank selected by us, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and 
interest on the notes to be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) 
discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond 
Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption 
price for the 2026 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after October 15, 2025 (the date that is three months 
prior to the maturity date) will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed on the redemption date, plus 
accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the 2027 Notes to be redeemed on any 
redemption date that is prior to January 27, 2027 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to the greater of 
(1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent investment bank selected
by us, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2027 Notes to be redeemed
(excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an
annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in each
case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the 2027 Notes to be redeemed on any
redemption date that is on or after January 27, 2027 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the 2027 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2027 Notes to
the date of redemption. In any case, the principal amount of a Notes remaining outstanding after a redemption in part shall be
€100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.
In connection with such optional redemption of Notes, the following defined terms apply:
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the yield to maturity, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal
places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, of the
Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government
Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected
by us.
“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion
of an independent investment bank selected by us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of
the Notes to be redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in
issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of,
and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the
Comparable Government Bond Rate.
The Notes are also subject to redemption prior to maturity if certain events occur involving United States taxation. If any of
these special tax events occur, the Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and 
unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. See “Redemption for Tax Reasons.”
Payment of Additional Amounts
We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Notes such additional 
amounts as are necessary in order that the net payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes to a holder of the Notes (or the 
beneficial owner for whose benefit such holder holds the Notes) who is not a United States person (as defined below), after 
withholding or deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by the United States or a 
taxing authority in the United States, will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be then due and payable; provided, 
however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:
(1) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed by reason of the holder (or the beneficial owner
for whose benefit such holder holds such note), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is 
an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder, being 
considered as:
(a) being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having or having had a
permanent establishment in the United States;
(b) having a current or former connection with the United States (other than a connection arising solely as a
result of the ownership of the Notes or the receipt of any payment or the enforcement of any rights thereunder), including being or 
having been a citizen or resident of the United States;
(c) being or having been a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled
foreign corporation for United States income tax purposes or a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States 
federal income tax;

United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any successor provision; or
(e) being a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into
in the ordinary course of its trade or business;
(2) to any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion of the Notes, or that is a fiduciary,
partnership or limited liability company, but only to the extent that a beneficial owner with respect to the holder, a beneficiary or 
settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have 
been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its 
beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
(3) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the
holder or any other person to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the 
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is 
required by statute, by regulation of the United States or any taxing authority therein or by an applicable income tax treaty to which 
the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(4) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding by us or an
applicable paying or withholding agent from the payment;
(5) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a change in law,
regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is 
duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
(6) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth, capital gains or personal property tax or similar tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;
(7) with respect to the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes, to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an
individual and that is required to be made pursuant to any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, 
any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings;
(8) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment
of principal of or interest on any note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;
(9) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by
the holder of any note, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment 
became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
(10) with respect to the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes, to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed
or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner being a bank (i) purchasing the Notes in the ordinary course of its lending 
business or (ii) that is neither (A) buying the Notes for investment purposes only nor (B) buying the Notes for resale to a third-party 
that either is not a bank or holding the Notes for investment purposes only;
(11) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any
amended or successor provisions), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into 
pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any 
intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code; or
(12) in the case of any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).
The Notes are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation 
applicable to the Notes. Except as specifically provided under this heading “Payment of Additional Amounts,” we are not required to 
make any payment for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or 
taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.
As used under this heading “Payment of Additional Amounts” and under the heading “Redemption for Tax Reasons”, the 
term “United States” means the United States of America, the states of the United States, and the District of Columbia, and the term 
“United States person” means any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for United States federal income tax 
purposes, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the 
United States or the District of Columbia, or any estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation 
regardless of its source.
With respect to the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes, to the extent permitted by law, we will maintain a paying agent in a Member 
State of the European Union (if any) that will not require withholding or deduction of tax pursuant to European Council Directive 
2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such 
European Council Directive.
Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the 
United States (or any taxing authority in the United States), or any change in, or amendment to, an official position regarding the 
application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, we become or, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel 
selected by us, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described under the heading “Payment of Additional Amounts” 
with respect to the Notes, then we may at any time at our option redeem, in whole, but not in part, any series of the Notes on not less 
than 15 nor more than 45 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with accrued and 
unpaid interest on such Notes to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.
Change of Control Offer to Purchase
If a change of control triggering event occurs, holders of Notes may require us to repurchase all or any part (equal to an 
integral multiple of €1,000) of their Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if 
any, on such Notes to the date of purchase (unless a notice of redemption has been mailed within 30 days after such change of control 
triggering event stating that all of the Notes of such series will be redeemed as described above); provided that the principal amount of 
a Note remaining outstanding after a repurchase in part shall be €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. We are 
required to mail to holders of the Notes a notice describing the transaction or transactions constituting the change of control triggering 
event and offering to repurchase the Notes. The notice must be mailed within 30 days after any change of control triggering event, and 
the repurchase must occur no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days after the date the notice is mailed.
On the date specified for repurchase of the Notes, we will, to the extent lawful:
accept for payment all properly tendered Notes or portions of Notes;
deposit with the paying agent the required payment for all properly tendered Notes or portions of Notes; and
deliver to the trustee the repurchased Notes, accompanied by an officers’ certificate stating, among other things, the
aggregate principal amount of repurchased Notes.
We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other
securities laws and regulations applicable to the repurchase of the Notes. To the extent that these requirements conflict with the 
provisions requiring repurchase of the Notes, we will comply with these requirements instead of the repurchase provisions and will not 
be considered to have breached our obligations with respect to repurchasing the Notes. Additionally, if an event of default exists under 
the Indenture (which is unrelated to the repurchase provisions of the Notes), including events of default arising with respect to other 
issues of debt securities, we will not be required to repurchase the Notes notwithstanding these repurchase provisions.
We will not be required to comply with the obligations relating to repurchasing the Notes if a third party instead satisfies 
them.
For purposes of the repurchase provisions of the Notes, the following terms are applicable:
“Change of control” means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the consummation of any transaction (including, 
without limitation, any merger or consolidation) resulting in any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (other than us or one of our subsidiaries) becoming the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-
3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our voting stock or 
other voting stock into which our voting stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather 
than number of shares; (b) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or 
consolidation), in a transaction or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our 
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to one or more “persons” (as that term is defined in the Indenture) (other than us or one of our 
subsidiaries); or (c) the first day on which a majority of the members of our Board of Directors are not continuing directors. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be considered to be a change of control if (a) we become a direct or indirect 
wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (b)(y) immediately following that transaction, the direct or indirect holders of the 
voting stock of the holding company are substantially the same as the holders of our voting stock immediately prior to that transaction 
or (z) immediately following that transaction no person is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting 
stock of the holding company.
“Change of control triggering event” means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
“Continuing directors” means, as of any date of determination, any member of our Board of Directors who (a) was a member 
of the Board of Directors on the date the Notes were issued or (b) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of 
Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such 
nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of our proxy statement in which such member was 
named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
“Fitch” means Fitch Ratings.
“Investment grade rating” means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) 
by Moody’s and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement rating 
agency or rating agencies selected by us.
“Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
“Rating agencies” means (a) each of Fitch, Moody’s and S&P; and (b) if any of Fitch, Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the 
Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of our control, a “nationally recognized statistical 
rating organization” (as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) selected by us as a 
replacement rating agency for a former rating agency.
“Rating event” means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the rating agencies and the Notes are rated below an 
investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so 
long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after 
the earlier of (a) the occurrence of a change of control and (b) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or our intention to 
effect a change of control; provided that a rating event will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control 
(and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of change of control triggering event) if each rating agency 
making the reduction in rating does not publicly announce or confirm or inform the trustee in writing at our request that the reduction 
was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the change of 
control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event).
“S&P” means S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., and its successors.
“Voting stock” means, with respect to any specified “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the 
election of the board of directors of such person.
Sinking Fund
The Notes are not subject to, or entitled to the benefit of, any sinking fund.
Conversion or Exchange Rights
The Notes are not convertible or exchangeable for shares of our common stock or other securities.
Certain Restrictive Covenants
The Indenture contains restrictive covenants that apply the Notes, the most significant of which are described below.
Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and Canadian Operating Subsidiaries 
Some of our property may be subject to a mortgage or other legal mechanism that gives our lenders preferential rights in that 
property over other lenders, including direct holders of the Notes, or over our general creditors, if we fail to pay them back. These 
preferential rights are called “liens.” The Indenture restricts our ability to create, issue, assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness 
for borrowed money that is secured by a mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance on:
any flour mill, manufacturing or packaging plant or research laboratory located in the United States or Canada owned by us
or one of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries; or
any stock or debt issued by one of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries
unless we also secure all the Notes that are still outstanding under the Indenture equally with the indebtedness being secured. This 
promise does not restrict our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of our interests in any United States or Canadian operating subsidiary.
These requirements do not apply to liens:
existing on February 1, 1996 and any extensions, renewals or replacements of those liens;
relating to the construction, improvement or purchase of a flour mill, plant or laboratory;
in favor of us or one of our United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries;
in favor of governmental units for financing construction, improvement or purchase of our property;
existing on any property, stock or debt existing at the time we acquire it, including liens on property, stock or debt of a
United States or Canadian operating subsidiary at the time it became our United States or Canadian operating subsidiary;
relating to the sale of our property;
for work done on our property;
relating to workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance and similar obligations;
relating to litigation or legal judgments;
for taxes, assessments or governmental charges not yet due; or
consisting of easements or other restrictions, defects in title or encumbrances on our real property.
We may also avoid securing the Notes equally with the indebtedness being secured if the amount of the indebtedness being
secured plus the value of any sale and lease back transactions, as described below, is 15% or less than the amount of our consolidated 
total assets minus our consolidated non-interest bearing current liabilities, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet.
If a merger or other transaction would create any liens that are not permitted as described above, we must grant an equivalent 
lien to the direct holders of the Notes.
Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions 
The Indenture also provides that we and our United States and Canadian operating subsidiaries will not enter into any sale 
and leaseback transactions on any of our flourmills, manufacturing or packaging plants or research laboratories located in the United 
States or Canada owned by us or one of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries (“principal properties”) 
unless we satisfy some restrictions. A sale and leaseback transaction involves our sale to a lender or other investor of a property of 
ours and our leasing back that property from that party for more than three years, or a sale of a property to, and its lease back for three 
or more years from, another person who borrows the necessary funds from a lender or other investor on the security of the property.
We may enter into a sale and leaseback transaction covering any of our principal properties only if:
it falls into the exceptions for liens described above under “— Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and
Canadian Operating Subsidiaries”; or
within 180 days after the property sale, we set aside for the retirement of funded debt, meaning notes or bonds that mature at
or may be extended to a date more than 12 months after issuance, an amount equal to the greater of:
othe net proceeds of the sale of the principal property, or
othe fair market value of the principal property sold, and in either case, minus
othe principal amount of any debt securities issued under the Indenture that are delivered to the trustee for retirement
within 120 days after the property sale, and
othe principal amount of any funded debt, other than debt securities issued under the Indenture, voluntarily retired by
us within 120 days after the property sale; or
the attributable value, as described below, of all sale and leaseback transactions plus any indebtedness that we incur that, but
for the exception in the second to last paragraph of “— Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and
Canadian Operating Subsidiaries” above, would have required us to secure the Notes equally with it, is 15% or less than the
amount of our consolidated total assets minus our consolidated non-interest bearing current liabilities, as reflected on our
consolidated balance sheet.
We determine the attributable value of a sale and leaseback transaction by choosing the lesser of (1) or (2) below:
1. sale price of the leased property   x   remaining portion of the base
term of the lease
the base term of the lease
2. the total obligation of the lessee for rental payments during the remaining portion of the base term of the lease, discounted to
present value at the highest interest rate on any outstanding series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. The rental
payments in this calculation do not include amounts for property taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance, water rates and other
items that are not payments for the property itself.
Mergers and Similar Events
We are generally permitted under the Indenture to consolidate or merge with another company. We are also permitted to sell
or lease some or all of our assets to another company. However, we may not take any of these actions unless the following conditions, 
among others, are met:
where we merge out of existence or sell or lease substantially all our assets, the other company must be a corporation, limited
liability company, partnership or trust organized under the laws of a state or the District of Columbia or under United States
federal law and it must expressly agree in a supplemental indenture to be legally responsible for the Notes; and
the merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not bring about a default on the Notes (for purposes of this test, a default
would include an event of default described below under “Default and Related Matters” and any event that would be an event
of default if the requirements for giving us notice of our default or our default having to exist for a specific period of time
were disregarded).
There is no precise, established definition of what would constitute a sale or lease of substantially all of our assets under
applicable law and, accordingly, there may be uncertainty as to whether a sale or lease of less than all of our assets would subject us to 
this provision.
If we merge out of existence or transfer (except through a lease) substantially all our assets, and the other firm becomes our 
successor and is legally responsible for the Notes, we will be relieved of our own responsibility for the Notes.
Default and Related Matters
Noteholders will have special rights if an event of default occurs and is not cured. For each series of Notes the term “event of 
default” means any of the following:
we do not pay interest on a Note of that series within 30 days of its due date;
we do not pay the principal or any premium on a Note of that series on its due date;
we do not deposit money into a separate custodial account, known as a sinking fund, when such a deposit is due, if we agree
to maintain a sinking fund with respect to that series;
we remain in breach of any restrictive covenant with respect to that series or any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after
we receive a notice of default stating we are in breach (the notice must be sent by either the trustee or direct holders of at least
25% of the principal amount of Notes of the affected series); or
we file for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur.
In the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding, all of the Notes will automatically be due and
immediately payable. If a non-bankruptcy event of default has occurred with respect to any series of Notes and has not been cured, the 
trustee or the direct holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes of the affected series may declare the entire 
principal amount of all the Notes of that series to be due and immediately payable. This is called a “declaration of acceleration of 
maturity.”
A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the direct holders of at least a majority in principal amount of 
the Notes of the affected series if any other defaults on those Notes have been waived or cured and we pay or deposit with the trustee 
an amount sufficient to pay the following with respect to the Notes of that series:
all overdue interest;
principal and premium, if any, which has become due, other than as a result of the acceleration, plus any interest on that
principal;
interest on overdue interest, to the extent that payment is lawful; and
amounts paid or advanced by the trustee and reasonable trustee compensation and expenses.
Except in cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the
Indenture at the request of any direct holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability, 
called an “indemnity.” If reasonable indemnity is provided, the direct holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding 
Notes of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any 
remedy available to the trustee. These majority direct holders may also direct the trustee in exercising any trust or power conferred on 
the trustee under the Indenture.
Before an investor may bypass the trustee and bring its own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce 
its rights or protect its interests relating to any Notes of any series, the following must occur:
the investor must give the trustee written notice that an event of default with respect to the Notes of that series has occurred
and remains uncured;
the direct holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding Notes of that series must make a written request that
the trustee take action because of the default, and must offer reasonable indemnity to the trustee against any cost and
liabilities of taking that action;
the trustee must not have received from direct holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that
series a direction inconsistent with the written notice; and
the trustee must have failed to take action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity.
However, investors are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on a Note on or after its due date.
Every year we will certify in a written statement to the trustee that we are in compliance with the Indenture and each series of 
Notes or specify any default that we know about.
Defeasance
In some circumstances described below, we may elect to discharge our obligations on the Notes through defeasance or 
covenant defeasance.
Full Defeasance 
If there is a change in United States federal tax law as described below, we could legally release ourselves from any payment 
or other obligations on the Notes, called “full defeasance,” if we put in place the following arrangements for investors to be repaid:
we must irrevocably deposit in trust for the benefit of all direct holders of those Notes money or specified German
government securities or a combination of these that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other
payments on those Notes on their various due dates;
there must be a change in current federal tax law or an Internal Revenue Service ruling that lets us make the deposit without
causing investors to be taxed on the Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit and simply repaid such Notes
ourselves (under current United States federal tax law, the deposit and our legal release from the such Notes would be treated
as though we took back such Notes and gave investors their share of the cash and notes or bonds deposited in trust, in which
case investors could recognize gain or loss on those Notes); and
we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming the United States tax law change described above.
In addition, no default must have occurred and be continuing with respect to those Notes at the time the deposit is made (and,
with respect only to bankruptcy and similar events, during the 90 days following the deposit), and we have delivered a certificate and a 
legal opinion to the effect that the deposit does not:
cause any outstanding Notes to be delisted;
cause the trustee to have a “conflicting interest” within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939;
result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which we are party or by
which we are bound; and
result in the trust arising from it constituting an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 (unless we register the trust, or find an exemption from registration, under that Act).
If we ever did accomplish full defeasance, investors would have to rely solely on the trust deposit, and could no longer look
to us, for repayment on the Notes of the affected series. Conversely, the trust deposit would likely be protected from claims of our 
lenders and other creditors if we ever become bankrupt or insolvent.
Covenant Defeasance 
Under current United States federal tax law, we can make the same type of deposit described above and be released from 
many of the covenants in the Notes. This is called “covenant defeasance.” In that event, investors would lose the protection of those 
covenants but would gain the protection of having money and securities set aside in trust to repay the applicable series of Notes. In 
order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the following:
make the same deposit of money and/or German government securities described above under “— Full Defeasance;”
deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that under current United States federal income tax law we may make the
above deposit without causing investors to be taxed on the applicable series of Notes any differently than if we did not make
the deposit and simply repaid the applicable series of Notes ourselves; and
comply with the other conditions precedent described above under “— Full Defeasance.”
If we accomplish covenant defeasance, the following provisions, among others, would no longer apply:
the events of default relating to breach of covenants described below under “Default and Related Matters;” and
any promises regarding conduct of our business, such as those described under “Certain Restrictive Covenants” below and
any other covenants applicable to the series of Notes.
If we accomplish covenant defeasance, investors can still look to us for repayment of the applicable series of Notes if there is
a shortfall in the trust deposit. Depending on the event causing the default, however, investors may not be able to obtain payment of 
the shortfall.
Modification and Waiver
There are three types of changes we can make to the Indenture and the Notes.
First, there are changes that cannot be made to the Notes without specific investor approval. These include:
change of the stated due date for payment of principal or interest on a series of Notes;
reduction in the principal amount of, the rate of interest payable on or any premium payable upon redemption of a series of
Notes;
reduction in the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of a series of Notes following a default;
change in the place or currency of payment on a series of Notes;
impairment of an investor’s right to sue for payment on a series of Notes on or after the due date for such payment;
reduction in the percentage of direct holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required to modify or amend the Indenture;
reduction in the percentage of holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required under the Indenture to waive compliance
with provisions of, or to waive defaults under, the Indenture; and
modification of any of the provisions described above or other provisions of the Indenture dealing with waiver of defaults or
covenants under the Indenture, except to increase the percentages required for such waivers or to provide that other
provisions of the Indenture cannot be changed without the consent of each direct holder affected by the change.
Second, changes may be made by us and the trustee without any vote by holders of any series of Notes. These include:
evidencing the assumption by a successor of our obligations under the Indenture and any series of Notes;
adding to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of any series of Notes, or surrendering any of our rights or powers
under the Indenture;
adding other events of default for the benefit of holders of any series of Notes;
making such changes as may be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of any series of Notes in bearer or uncertificated
form;
establishing the forms or terms of any series of Notes;
evidencing the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee; and
curing any ambiguity, correcting any Indenture provision that may be defective or inconsistent with other Indenture
provisions or making any other change that does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any series of Notes in any
material respect.
Third, we need a vote by direct holders of Notes owning at least a majority of the principal amount of each series affected by
the change to make any other change to the Indenture that is not of the type described in the preceding two paragraphs. A majority 
vote of this kind is also required to obtain a waiver of any past default, except a payment default on principal or interest or concerning 
a provision of the Indenture that cannot be changed without the consent of the direct holder.
When taking a vote, we will decide how much principal amount to attribute to a series of Notes by using the dollar 
equivalent, as determined by our Board of Directors.
Notes will not be considered outstanding, and therefore will not be eligible to vote, if owned by us or one of our affiliates or 
if we have deposited or set aside money in trust for their payment or redemption. Notes will also not be eligible to vote if they have 
been fully defeased as described below under “Defeasance — Full Defeasance.”
We will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the direct holders of outstanding 
Notes that are entitled to vote or take other action under the Indenture. In some circumstances, generally related to a default by us on a 
series of the Notes, the trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders.
Trustee
U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee under the Indenture, has been appointed by us as paying agent and registrar with 
regard to the Notes. The trustee also acts as an agent for the issuance of our United States commercial paper. The trustee and its 
affiliates currently provide cash management and other banking and advisory services to us in the normal course of business and may 
from time to time in the future provide other banking and advisory services to us in the ordinary course of business, in each case in 
exchange for a fee.
Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Note
We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and 
Euroclear Bank, S.A./N.V., or its successor, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and their book-entry systems and 
procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In 
addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream 
and Euroclear as they were in effect at the time of the issuance of the Notes of each series. Those clearing systems could change their 
rules and procedures at any time.
The Notes are represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note is deposited with, or on behalf 
of, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and 
Euroclear. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or 
their respective nominees. Investors may hold interests in the global notes in Europe through Clearstream or Euroclear, either as a 
participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will 
hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating organizations or customers through customers’ securities 
accounts in Clearstream’s or Euroclear’s names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the Notes and all 
transfers relating to the Notes are reflected in the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear.
The distribution of the Notes is cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear. Any secondary market trading of book-entry 
interests in the Notes takes place through Clearstream and Euroclear participants and settles in same-day funds. Owners of book-entry 
interests in the Notes receive payments relating to their Notes in euro, except as described under the heading “Payments in Euro.”
Clearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial 
links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the Notes to be issued, 
held and transferred among the clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to facilitate clearance 
and settlement have been established among these clearing systems to trade securities across borders in the secondary market.
The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the 
investor’s interest in the Notes held by them. We have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear 
or any of their direct or indirect participants. We also do not supervise these systems in any way.
Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they 
have made with one another or with their customers. Investors should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to 
perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at any time.
Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in the Notes will not be entitled to have the Notes registered in their 
names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners 
or holders of the Notes under the Indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to 
the Indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and, if 
such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, in order to exercise 
any rights of a holder of Notes.
We have been advised by Clearstream and Euroclear, respectively, as follows:
Clearstream
Clearstream advises that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds 
securities for its participating organizations (“Clearstream Participants”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants, thereby 
eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants, among other things, 
services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and 
borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. As a professional depositary, Clearstream is subject to 
regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur 
Financier). Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers 
and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect 
access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a 
custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant, either directly or indirectly.
Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Clearstream are credited to cash accounts of 
Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures.
Euroclear
Euroclear advises that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to 
clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, 
thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and 
cash. Euroclear includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in 
several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”). All operations are conducted by the 
Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear 
Operator. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional 
financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear 
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.
The Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System, or the 
Euroclear Terms and Conditions, and applicable Belgian law govern securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the 
Euroclear Operator. Specifically, these terms and conditions govern:
transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear;
withdrawal of securities and cash from Euroclear; and
receipt of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear.
All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities
clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has no 
record of or relationship with persons holding securities through Euroclear Participants.
Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear are credited to the cash accounts of 
Euroclear Participants in accordance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions.
Clearance and Settlement Procedures
We understand that investors that hold their Notes through Clearstream or Euroclear accounts will follow the settlement 
procedures that are applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Notes are credited to the securities custody accounts of 
Clearstream and Euroclear participants on the business day following the settlement date, for value on the settlement date. They are 
credited either free of payment or against payment for value on the settlement date.
We understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants will occur in the ordinary 
way following the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using 
procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form.
Investors should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other 
communications involving the Notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those 
systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.
In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and 
Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. United States investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or 
to make or receive a payment or delivery of the Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until 
the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.
Clearstream or Euroclear will credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as 
applicable, in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the 
Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture on behalf of a 
Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures.
Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the Notes among 
participants of Clearstream and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, 
and they may discontinue those procedures at any time.
Certificated Notes
If the depositary for any of the Notes of any series represented by a registered global note is at any time unwilling or unable 
to continue as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 90 days, we will issue Notes of that series in 
definitive form in exchange for the registered global note that had been held by the depositary. Any Notes issued in definitive form in 
exchange for a registered global note will be registered in the name or names that the depositary gives to the trustee or other relevant 
agent of the trustee. It is expected that the depositary’s instructions will be based upon directions received by the depositary from 
participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the registered global note that had been held by the depositary. In 
addition, we may at any time determine that the Notes of any series shall no longer be represented by a global note and will issue 
Notes of such series in definitive form in exchange for such global note pursuant to the procedure described above.
