Intel previously announced the organizational change to integrate its Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics 
Group into its Client Computing Group and Data Center and AI Group. This change is intended to drive a more 
effective go -to-market capability a nd to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a 
result, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other 
business reorganizations. All prior -period segment data has b een retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the 
company internally receives information and manages and monitors operating segment performance starting in 
fiscal year 2023.

Business Highlights  
 
▪ Intel continues to be on track to meet its goal of achieving five nodes in four years, with two of the five 
nodes nearly complete. Intel 7 is in high -volume manufacturing and CCG's Meteor Lake product  on Intel 4 
is ramping production wafer starts for an expected launch in the second half of 2023. Intel 3, Intel 20A, and 
Intel 18A remain on track.  
▪ DCAI shipped its 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (code -named Sapphire Rapids), a critical part 
of Intel’s heterogeneous hardware and software portfolio to accelerate real -world workloads, including AI, as 
it looks to truly democratize AI through an open and secure ecosystem approach.  
▪ DCAI also announced it expects to deliver Intel’s 5th Gen Xeon Scala ble processor, Emerald Rapids, later 
this year. In addition, the business narrowed the delivery window for Sierra Forest, which is expected to ship 
to customers in the first half of 2024, with Granite Rapids expected to follow shortly thereafter. Clearwate r 
Forest, the follow -on to Sierra Forest, is expected to ship in 2025, and will be manufactured on Intel 18A, 
the node designed to achieve process leadership and representing the culmination of the company’s five -
nodes -in-four-years strategy. Additionally,  the Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) had an all -time record 
revenue quarter in Q1.  
▪ IFS and Arm announced a multigeneration agreement to enable chip designers to build low -power compute 
system -on-chips (SoCs) on the Intel 18A process. Intel delivered and  supplied the first multi -chip package 
(MCP) prototypes created under the U.S. Department of Defense’s State -of-the-Art Heterogeneous 
Integrated Packaging (SHIP) program to BAE Systems six quarters ahead of schedule, showcasing the 
company’s commitment to customers while further supporting the DOD’s mission to return the U.S. to a

^ No adjustment on a non -GAAP basis.  Business Outlook  
Intel's guidance for the second quarter of 2023 includes both GAAP and non -GAAP estimates. Rec onciliations 
between GAAP and non -GAAP financial measures are included below.*  
Q2 2023   GAAP*   Non-GAAP*  
  Approximately   Approximately  
Revenue   $11.5 -12.5 billion   $11.5 -12.5 billion^  
Gross margin   33.2%   37.5%  
Tax rate   (85)%   13% 
Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel - diluted   $(0.62)   $(0.04)  
 
Actual results may differ materially from Intel’s Business Outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors 
described under “Forward -Looking Statements” below.  
 
*Effective January 2023, Intel increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five yea rs to eight years. 
When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by $4.1 
billion. We expect this change will result in an approximately $2.3 billion increase to gross margin, a $400 million decrease  in R&D expenses, 
and a $1.4 billion decrease in ending inventory values. Intel’s Q2 2023 outlook inc ludes an approximately $500 million benefit to operating 
margin or $0.10 benefit to EPS from this change, split approximately 80% to cost of sales and 20% to operating expenses. The change in 
depreciable life will not be counted toward the $3 billion in co st savings in 2023 or the $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025 communicated at Q3 
2022 earnings.   
 
Earnings Webcast  
Intel will hold a public webcast at 2 p.m. PST today to discuss the results for its first quarter 2023. The live public 
webcast can be accessed on Intel's Investor Relations website at www.intc.com . The corresponding earnings

Explanation of Non -GAAP Measures  
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the 
non-GAAP financial measures below. We  believe these non -GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful 
supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results 
between periods where certain items may vary independent of business perfor mance, and allow for greater 
transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our 
performance. These non -GAAP financial measures are used in our performance -based RSUs and our cash bonus 
plans.   
Our non -GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the  following  items, as well as the 
related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using  a fixed long -term projected 
tax rate across all adjustments. We pro ject this long -term non -GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five -year 
non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non -GAAP 
tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax posi tions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation 
in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long -term non -GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a 
variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant change s in our geographic 
earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non -GAAP tax rate in 
managing internal short - and long -term operating plans and in evaluating our performance ; we believe this 
approach facilitate s comparison of our operating results and provide s useful evaluation of our current operating 
performance . Prior -period non -GAAP results have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this updated approach.  
 
These non -GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures 
calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and 
reconciliations from these results sh ould be carefully evaluated.  
 
Non-GAAP 
adjustment or 
measure  Definition  Usefulness to management and investors  
Acquisition -related 
adjustments  Amortization of acquisition -related intangible assets 
consists of amortization of intangible assets such 
as developed technology, brands, and customer 
relationships acquired in connection with business 
combinations. Charges related to the amortization 
of these intangibles are recorded within both cost 
of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial 
statements. Amorti zation charges are recorded 
over the estimated useful life of the related 
acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally 
recorded over multiple years.  We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition -
related intangible assets for purposes of calculat ing 
certain non -GAAP measures because these charges 
are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted 
by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These 
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our 
current operating performance and compariso n to our 
past operating performance and provide investors with 
additional means to evaluate cost and expense 
trends.  
Share -based 
compensation  Share -based compensation consists of charges 
related to our employee equity incentive plans.  We exclude charges related to share -based 
compensation for purposes of calculating certain non -
GAAP measures because we believe these 
adjustments provide better comparability to peer 
company results and because these charges are not 
viewed by management as part of ou r core operating 
performance. We believe these adjustments provide 
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of 
management, of our core business model, how 
management currently evaluates core operational 
performance, and additional means to evaluate 
expense trends, including in comparison to other peer 
companies.  
Intel/Page 12 
 Non-GAAP 
adjustment or 
measure  Definition  Usefulness to management and investors  
Restructuring and 
other charges  Restructuring charges are costs associated with a 
formal restructuring plan and are primarily related 
to employee severance and benefit arrangements. 
Other charges may include periodic goodwill and 
asset impairments, certain pension charges, and 
costs associated with restructuring activity, and in 
Q1 2022 includes a benefit related to the annulled 
EC fine.  We exclude restructuring and othe r charges, including 
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, 
for purposes of calculating certain non -GAAP 
measures because these costs do not reflect our core 
operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a 
useful evaluation of our core  operating performance 
and comparisons to past operating results and provide 
investors with additional means to evaluate expense 
trends.  
Gains (losses) 
from divestiture  Gains (losses) are recognized at the close of a 
divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when 
deferred consideration is received at the time of 
closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the 
NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement 
entered into in connection with the first closing of 
the sale of our NAND memory  business on 
December 29, 2021, a portion of the initial closing 
consideration was deferred and will be recognized 
between first and second closing.  We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures 
for purposes of calculating certain non -GAAP 
measure s because they do not reflect our current 
operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a 
useful evaluation of our current operating performance 
and comparisons to past operating results.  
(Gains) losses on 
equity 
investments, net  (Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists 
of ongoing mark -to-market adjustments on 
marketable equity securities, observable price 
adjustments on non -marketable equity securities, 
related impairment charges, and the sale of equity 
investments and other.  We exclude these non -operating gains and losses for 
purposes of calculating certain non -GAAP measures 
because it provides better comparability between 
periods. The exclusion reflects how management 
evaluates the core operations of the business.  
Adjusted free cash 
flow We reference a non -GAAP financial measure of 
adjusted free cash flow, which is used by 
management when assessing our sources of 
liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. 
Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow 
adjusted for 1) additions to property, plant and 
equipment, net of proceeds from capital grants and 
partner contributions, 2) payments on finance 
leases, and 3) proceeds from the McAfee equity 
sale. This non -GAAP financial measure is helpful in 
understanding  our capital requirements and sources 
of liquidity by providing an additional means to 
evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since 
the 2017 divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and 
sales contributed to prior operating and free cash flow, 
and w hile the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would 
have typically been excluded from adjusted free cash 
flow as an equity sale, we believe including the sale 
proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better, 
more consistent comparison to past presentation s of 
liquidity.
