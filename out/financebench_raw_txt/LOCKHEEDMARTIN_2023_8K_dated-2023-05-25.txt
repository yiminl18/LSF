Ladies and Gentlemen:
Lockheed Martin Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions
stated herein, to issue and sell to the Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the “Underwriters”), for whom you are acting as
representatives (the “Representatives”), an aggregate of $500,000,000 principal amount of 4.450% Notes due 2028 (the “2028
Notes”), an aggregate of $850,000,000 principal amount of 4.750% Notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes”) and an aggregate of
$650,000,000 principal amount of 5.200% Notes due 2055 (the “2055 Notes”) issued by the Company (collectively, the
“Securities”).
The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities for general corporate purposes, as
described under the caption “Use of Proceeds” in the Pricing Prospectus (as defined below).
1.     The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:
(a)    An “automatic shelf registration statement” as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Act”) on Form S-3 (File No. 333-271325) in respect of the Securities has been filed by the Company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) not earlier than three years prior to the date hereof; such
registration statement, and any post-effective amendment thereto, became effective on filing; and no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceeding for
that purpose has been initiated or, to the knowledge of the Company, has been threatened by the Commission, and no
notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto
pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act has been received by the Company (the base prospectus filed as part of such
registration statement, in the form in
    
which it has most recently been filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called
the “Basic Prospectus”; any preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act together with the Basic Prospectus is hereinafter called a “Preliminary
Prospectus”; the various parts of such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto but excluding the Statement
of Eligibility and Qualification under the Trust Indenture Act (the “Form T-1”) and including any prospectus supplement
relating to the Securities that is filed with the Commission and deemed by virtue of Rule 430B under the Act to be part of
such registration statement, each as amended at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, are
hereinafter collectively called the “Registration Statement”; the Basic Prospectus, as amended and supplemented
immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined in Section 1(c) hereof), is hereinafter called the “Pricing
Prospectus”; the form of the final prospectus relating to the Securities filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof is hereinafter called the “Prospectus”; any reference
herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item
12 of Form S-3 under the Act, as of the date of the Registration Statement or such prospectus; any reference herein to
any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed
to refer to and include any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, any prospectus supplement relating
to the Securities filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act and any documents filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and incorporated by reference therein, in each
case after the date of the Basic Prospectus, such Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus, as the case may be; any
reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of
the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration
Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and any “issuer free writing prospectus” as
defined in Rule 433 under the Act relating to the Securities is hereinafter called an “Issuer Free Writing Prospectus”).
(b)    No order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus has been issued by the Commission, and each Preliminary Prospectus, at the time of filing thereof,
conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder, and did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with the information furnished in writing to the Company by an
Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, which for the avoidance of doubt, solely consists of
the information contained in Annex III hereto (the “Underwriter Provided Information”).
(c)    For the purposes of this Agreement, the “Applicable Time” is 3:50 p.m. (New York City time) on the date
of this Agreement; the Pricing Prospectus as supplemented by the final term sheet in the form attached as Schedule III
hereto and to be filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, taken together (collectively, the “Pricing Disclosure Package”)
as of the Applicable Time, did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule II(a) hereto does not conflict with the
information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the
Prospectus and each such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as supplemented by and taken together with the Pricing
Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time, did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to
2
    
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided,
however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to statements or omissions made in the Pricing
Disclosure Package or an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter
Provided Information.
(d)    The documents incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, when they
became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the
requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder, and when read together with other information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and
the Prospectus, at the respective times they became effective or were filed with the Commission, did not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; any further documents so
filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such
documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects
to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions
made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Provided Information; and no such documents were filed
with the Commission since the Commission’s close of business on the business day immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement and prior to the execution of this Agreement, except as set forth on Schedule II(b) hereto.
(e)    The Registration Statement conforms, and the Prospectus and any further amendments or supplements to
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”), and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to each part of the Registration
Statement and as of the applicable filing date and as of the Time of Delivery (as defined below) as to the Prospectus
and any amendment or supplement thereto, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that
this representation and warranty shall not apply to (i) any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in
conformity with the Underwriter Provided Information or (ii) any statements in or omissions from the part of the
Registration Statement that shall constitute the Form T-1 of the Trustee under the Indenture (as defined below).
(f)    (i) The Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole have not sustained since the date of the latest
audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any material loss or
material interference with their business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity or from any labor dispute or court or
governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus; (ii) since
the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus, there
has not been any material adverse change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus; and (iii) since the respective
dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have
been any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting
the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, otherwise
than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus.

(g)    The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under
the laws of the State of Maryland, with the corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business
as described in the Pricing Prospectus.
(h)    The Securities have been duly authorized and, when issued pursuant to the Indenture and delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute valid
and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the indenture, dated as of April 18,
2023 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (the
“Trustee”), under which they are to be issued; the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and to the effect of general
principles of equity.
(i)    The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the
Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein
contemplated (i) will not conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any of the terms or provisions

any of its subsidiaries is a party or is bound, (ii) will not result in any violation of the provisions of the Charter or Bylaws
of the Company or (iii) will not result in any violation of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties,
except in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) where the effect of such conflict, breach or default would not be material to the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole and would not adversely affect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such
court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture, except for those that have been
obtained or that may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and
distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.
(j)    The Company is not in violation of its Charter or Bylaws or in breach of any terms of, or in default under,
any agreement or undertaking of the Company in any such case in which the violation, breach or default would have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
(k)    Other than as set forth in the Pricing Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending
to which the Company is a party or of which any property of the Company is the subject which reasonably could be
expected individually, or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the financial position, stockholders’
equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to the Company’s
knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.
(l)    (A) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto
for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective
amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), and
(iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)
under the Act) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 under the Act, the
Company was a “well-known seasoned issuer” as
4
    
defined in Rule 405 under the Act; and (B) at the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the
Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) under the Act) of
the Securities, the Company was not an “ineligible issuer” as defined in Rule 405 under the Act.
2.    Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to each of the
Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, the principal
amounts of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto at a purchase price of 99.470% of
the principal amount of 2028 Notes, 99.224% of the principal amount of 2034 Notes and 98.365% of the principal amount of
2055 Notes, plus in each case accrued interest from May 25, 2023 to the Time of Delivery.
3.    Upon the authorization by you of the release of the Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer the
Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Prospectus. The Underwriters shall give
notice to the Company when all the Securities are sold for purposes of Section 5(c).
4.    (a) The Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter hereunder will be represented by one or more global
Securities in book-entry form that will be deposited by or on behalf of the Company with The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”) or its designated custodian. The Company will deliver the Securities to the Representatives, for the account of each
Underwriter, against payment by or on behalf of such Underwriter of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer in Federal
(same day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives, by causing DTC to credit the Securities to
the account of the Representatives at DTC. The Company will cause the certificates representing the Securities to be made
available to the Representatives for checking at least twenty-four hours prior to the Time of Delivery. The time and date of such
delivery and payment shall be 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on May 25, 2023 or such other time and date as the
Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing. Such time and date are herein called the “Time of Delivery”.
(b)    The Securities and documents to be delivered at the Time of Delivery by or on behalf of the parties hereto
pursuant to Section 8 hereof, including the cross-receipt for the Securities and any additional documents requested by the
Underwriters pursuant to Section 8(i) hereof, will be delivered, via remote communications, at the offices of Davis Polk &
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 (the “Closing Location”) (for the avoidance of doubt,
delivery of an executed counterpart signature page with respect to any of the aforementioned documents by facsimile, email
(PDF) or other electronic signature shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart). For the purposes of this
Section 4, “New York Business Day” shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day
on which banking institutions in New York City are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
5.     The Company agrees with each of the Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters:
(a)    to prepare the Prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b)
under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the date of this
Agreement; to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or
the Prospectus prior to the Time of Delivery which shall be disapproved by you in your reasonable judgment promptly
after reasonable notice thereof; to advise you, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any
amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any amendment or supplement to the
Prospectus has been filed and to furnish you with copies thereof; to file the term sheet attached hereto as Schedule III
pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such Rule; to file promptly all other material required
to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act; to file promptly all reports and
any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to
Section
5
    
13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the delivery of
a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required under the Act in
connection with the offering or sale of the Securities; to advise you during the period the delivery of a prospectus (or in
lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required under the Act in connection with the offering
or sale of the Securities, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus in respect of the
Securities, of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act, of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any
request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for
additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the
use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use all
reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; and in the event of any such issuance of a notice of objection,
promptly to take such steps including, without limitation, amending the Registration Statement or filing a new
registration statement, at its own expense, as may be necessary to permit offers and sales of the Securities by the
Underwriters (references herein to the Registration Statement shall include any such amendment or new registration
statement);
(b)    if required by Rule 430B(h) under the Act, to prepare a form of prospectus in a form approved by you and
to file such form of prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than may be required by Rule 424(b)
under the Act; and to make no further amendment or supplement to such form of prospectus which shall be disapproved
by you in your reasonable judgment promptly after reasonable notice thereof;
(c)    if by the third anniversary (the “Renewal Deadline”) of the initial effective date of the Registration
Statement, any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will file, if it has not already done so
and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to
you. If at the Renewal Deadline the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the
Company will, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form
satisfactory to you and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180
days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public
offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the
Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration
statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be;
(d)    promptly from time to time to take such action as you may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for
offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as you may request and to comply with such laws so as
to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to
complete the distribution of the Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be obligated to
subject itself to taxation or to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or be required to
qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
(e)    prior to 6:00 p.m., New York City time, on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this
Agreement and from time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with electronic copies of the Prospectus as you may
reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the
Act) is required at any time prior to the expiration of nine months after the time of issue of the Prospectus in
6
    
connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of
which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is
delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or
supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify you and upon your
request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in
securities electronic copies as you may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a
supplement to the Prospectus that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any
Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in
connection with sales of any of the Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus,
upon your request but at the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written
and electronic copies as you may reasonably request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with
Section 10(a)(3) of the Act;
(f)    during the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the Time of Delivery, not
to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company that are substantially similar to the
Securities, without the prior written consent of the Representatives;
(g)    to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement of the
Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158);
(h)    to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)
(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under
the Act; and
(i)    to use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement in the
manner specified in the Pricing Prospectus under the caption “Use of Proceeds”.
6.    (a)    (i) The Company represents and agrees that, other than the final term sheet in the form attached as Schedule
III hereto and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, without the prior consent of the Representatives, it has not made and will not
make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a “free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 405 under the Act;
(ii)    each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the
Representatives, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Securities, containing certain information
contemplated by the final term sheet in the form attached as Schedule III hereto and related customary marketing
information (which marketing information shall have been agreed to by the Company), and conveyed to
purchasers of Securities in an electronic format customary in the industry, it has not made and will not make any
offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a “free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 405 under the
Act; and
(iii)    any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the
Representatives (other than the final term sheet in the form attached as Schedule III hereto filed pursuant to
Section 5(a) hereof) is listed on Schedule II(a) hereto.
7
    
(b)    The Company has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending.
(c)    The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event
occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the
Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then
prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the
Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other
document that will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall
not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with the
Underwriter Provided Information.
7.    The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid
the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the
registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the
Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the
Prospectus and any amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters
and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing this Agreement, the Indenture, the closing documents (including any
compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities;
(iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as
provided in Section 5(c) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such
qualification; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities;
(vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance
of its obligations hereunder that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that,
except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses,
including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses
connected with any offers they may make.
8.    The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in the Representatives’ discretion, to the condition
that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Applicable Time and
the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder
theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
(a)    The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within
the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with
Section 5(a) hereof; the final term sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed
by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable
time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or
threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order
suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or
threatened by the
8
    
Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to
your reasonable satisfaction.
(b)    Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to you such opinion or
opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, with respect to such matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel
shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such
matters.
(c)    Hogan Lovells US LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to you their written opinion, dated
the Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto.
(d)    In-house counsel to the Company shall have furnished to you its written opinion, dated the Time of
Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto.
(e)    On the date of the Prospectus and also at the Time of Delivery, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to
you a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to you
containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants “comfort letters” to underwriters
with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into
the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus.
(f)    (i) The Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole shall not have sustained since the date of the latest
audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any material loss or
material interference with their business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity or from any labor dispute or court or
governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii)
since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any
material adverse change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,
otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus or in connection with the adoption or effectiveness
of new accounting standards and (iii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing
Prospectus there shall not have been any material adverse change in the general affairs, management, financial
position or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from
transactions in the ordinary course of business, or any material adverse change, or any development involving a
prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders'
equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or
contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), in your
judgment makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as
contemplated in this Agreement and in the Prospectus.
(g)    On or after the Applicable Time, no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's
debt securities by any “nationally recognized statistical rating organization”, as that term is defined by the Commission

activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or
securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv)
9
    
the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national
emergency or war; or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic
conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clauses (i) through (v) in your
judgment makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms
and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
(i)    The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of
officers of the Company satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be
performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such
other matters as you may reasonably request.
9.    (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any and all losses, claims,
damages and liabilities, joint or several (including any reasonable investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in
connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, provided that legal
expenses relate to counsel acceptable to the Company), to which they, or any of them, may become subject under the Act, the
Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities arise solely out of or are based solely upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing
Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any “issuer
information” filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission was made in (i) the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the
Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in
reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Provided Information or (ii) that part of the Registration Statement that
constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualifications on Form T-1 of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act, except
statements or omissions in such Form T-1 made in reliance upon information furnished in writing to the Trustee by or on behalf
of the Company for use therein.
(b)    Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise solely out
of or are based solely upon any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that was made in the
Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with the
Underwriter Provided Information; provided, however, that the obligation of each such Underwriter to indemnify the Company
hereunder shall be limited to the total price at which the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder were offered to
the public.
(c)    Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 9 will, promptly after receipt of
notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against any such party in respect of which a claim is to be made
against an indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify each such indemnifying party of the commencement of such action,
suit or proceeding, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party of any such
action, suit or proceeding shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under
Section 9(a) or 9(b), as applicable (it being understood that the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall relieve it
from any liability it may have to any indemnified party under Section 9(a) or 9(b); provided, however, that timely notice
hereunder to the
10
    
Representatives made pursuant to Section 13 hereof shall be deemed timely notice to any Underwriter that is an indemnifying
party). In case any such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party or parties shall be entitled to participate in, and, to
the extent that it or they shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party or parties to such indemnified
party of its or their election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party or parties shall not be liable to such
indemnified party for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ its counsel in any
such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the
employment of counsel by such indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties, (ii) the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party or
parties and the indemnified party in the conduct of the defense of such action (in which case the indemnifying party or parties
shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party), or (iii) the indemnifying party or
parties shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and
expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. In the event that the indemnified party retains
separate counsel pursuant to clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of the previous sentence, such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
indemnifying party. Any indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its
written consent.
(d)    If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to hold harmless an indemnified party under
subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to
therein (other than because such indemnification, by its terms, does not apply), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand
and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in
respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by
applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one
hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such
offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions
received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if
the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as
a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall
be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall
be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it
and distributed to investors were offered to investors
11
    
exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their
respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e)    The obligations of the Company under this Section 99 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may
otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter
within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability
which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer
and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10.    (a)    If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase any Securities that it has agreed to purchase
hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the
terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of
such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party
or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective
prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company
notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone
the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made
necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company
agrees to prepare and file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in
your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term “Underwriter” as used in this Agreement shall include any person
substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to
such Securities.
(b)    If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities
that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company
shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such
Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata
share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of
such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve
a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)    If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that
remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b)
above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters
to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without
liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company
and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but
nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(d)    For purposes of this Section 10, the Securities shall be treated as separate series, and Section 10 shall apply to
each series as if this Agreement applied solely to such series.
12
    
11.    The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and
the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this
Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof)
made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director
or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12.    If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any
liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not
delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all
out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the
Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under
no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13.    In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be
entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be
delivered or sent by mail, email or facsimile transmission to you as the Representatives in care of (a) Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, Attention: General Counsel, Facsimile: (646) 291-1469; (b) Barclays
Capital Inc., 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Registration, Facsimile: (646) 834-8133);
and (c) Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Schlomo
Schiff; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration
Statement, Attention: Vice President and Treasurer (with a copy, which shall not constitute notice, to the Senior Vice President
and General Counsel). Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
14.    This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to
the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the
Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other
person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any
Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15.    Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term “business day” shall mean any day
when the EDGAR System on the Commission's website is accepting filings.
16.    The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this
Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters,
on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a
principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility
in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of
whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the
Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and
financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of
them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in
connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
13
    
17.    (a)    In the event that any Underwriter that is a Covered Entity becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S.
Special Resolution Regime, the transfer from such Underwriter of this Agreement, and any interest and obligation in or under
this Agreement, will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution
Regime if this Agreement, and any such interest and obligation, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of
the United States.
(b)    In the event that any Underwriter that is a Covered Entity or a BHC Act Affiliate of such Underwriter becomes
subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under this Agreement that may be exercised
against such Underwriter are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under
the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United
States.
(c)    For purposes of this Section 17 a “BHC Act Affiliate” has the meaning assigned to the term “affiliate” in, and shall
be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. § 1841(k). “Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as
that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined
in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in
accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b). “Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in
accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable. “U.S. Special Resolution Regime” means each of (i) the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
18.    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York.
19.    This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart signature page by facsimile, email (PDF) or other electronic signature shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
20.    The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction
that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction,
and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits, without the Underwriters
imposing any limitation of any kind.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us counterparts hereof, and upon the
acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a
binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on
behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of
which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of

described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(b)    The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Corporation.
(c)    The Notes have been duly authorized by the Corporation, and, when executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in the
manner provided for in the Indenture against payment therefor in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will
constitute valid and binding obligations of the Corporation, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable
against the Corporation in accordance with their terms.
(d)    The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Corporation and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Corporation, enforceable against the Corporation in accordance with its terms.

the extent that such information constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by us and is correct
in all material respects, and (ii) the information in the Prospectus under the caption “Certain United States Federal Tax
Consequences,” to the extent that such information describes provisions of United States federal income tax law and
regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitutes an accurate summary of the matters described therein
in all material respects.

Corporation on the date hereof, do not (i) violate the Charter or Bylaws of the Corporation or (ii) violate any provision of
Applicable Federal Law or Applicable State Law.
S3-1
    
(g)    Based solely upon our review of the information regarding the Corporation provided through the EDGAR System on the
Commission's website, the Registration Statement became effective under the Securities Act. Based solely upon a
review of the Stop Orders page of the Commission’s website (http://www.sec.gov/litigation/stoporders.shtml), no stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities Act and no
proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
(h)    The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except for the financial statements and supporting schedules and other
financial or accounting information and data included therein or omitted therefrom and the Statement of Eligibility on
Form T-1 of the Trustee, in each case, as to which we express no opinion), at the time they were filed with the
Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act.
(i)    No approval or consent of, or registration or filing with, any federal governmental agency or the State Department of
Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland is required to be obtained or made by the Corporation under
Applicable Federal Law, the Maryland General Corporation Law or Applicable State Law in connection with the
execution and delivery by the Corporation of the Agreements or the consummation of the Agreements by the Company.
(j)    The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
Hogan Negative Assurance Letter
Subject to the foregoing, we confirm to you that, on the basis of the information we gained in the course of performing the
services referred to above, no facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that:
(i)    the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading;
(ii)    the Prospectus, as of its date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; or
(iii)    the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of [●] p.m. (New York City time) on May [●], 2023 (which you have informed us
is a time prior to the time of the first sale of the Notes by any Underwriter), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading;
A-I-2
    
provided that in making the foregoing statements, we do not express any belief with respect to the financial statements and
supporting schedules and other financial or accounting information and data derived from such financial statements and
schedules or the books and records of the Corporation or assessments of or reports on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting contained or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure

A-I-3
    
ANNEX II
Form of opinion of In-house counsel to the Company
1.    The Corporation is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to
qualify and be in good standing would not materially and adversely affect the financial condition of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
2.    To my knowledge, other than as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package, there are
not any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Corporation is subject, or of
which any property of the Corporation is subject, that reasonably are expected to have a material adverse effect
on the financial position, stockholders equity or results of operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole.
3.    Neither the issue and sale of the Notes, the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated by the
Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, nor the fulfillment of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and
the Indenture, will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under the terms of any indenture or
other agreement or instrument to which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries is a party or is bound, except
where the effect of such conflict, breach or default would not be material to the Corporation and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole and would not adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
4.    The documents filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and
incorporated by reference into the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, and all documents filed under the
Exchange Act and so deemed to be included in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto, (the "Exchange Act Reports") (other than the financial statements and notes thereto, the
financial statements schedules and the other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to
which I express no opinion), subject to any amendments or supplements thereto included in the Exchange Act
Reports filed before the date of the Underwriting Agreement, when they were filed with the Commission,
complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder.
5.    The execution and delivery by the Corporation of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes, and
the performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes by the Corporation on the date of
this opinion, do not, to my knowledge, violate any order or regulation applicable to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental agency or arbitrator having
jurisdiction over the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

4.450% Note due 2028
1. Inter est. Lockhee d Martin Corporation (the “Corporation”), a Maryland corporation, promises to pay interest on
the princip al amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Corporation will pay interest semi-annually in arrears
on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2023. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most
recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from May 25, 2023. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
2. Method of Payment.  The Corporation will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest, which shall be
paid as set forth below) to the persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the record date for the next
interest payment date even if the Notes  are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Any such
interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such regular record date
and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of
business on a specia l record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Corporation, notice whereof shall
be given to Holders  of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner , all as more fully provi ded in the Indenture. Holders must surrender the Notes to a Paying Agent to collect
principal payments. The Corporation will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However , the Corporat ion may pay principal and interest by its check
payable in such money . It may mail an interest check to a
3
    
Holder ’s registered address. To the extent lawful, the Corporation shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the
Notes and shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate.
3. Paying Agent and Registrar . Initially , U.S. Bank Trust Company , National Association (the “Trustee”) will act as
Paying Agent and Registrar . The Corporation may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar .
4. Indentur e. The Corporation issued the Notes under an Indenture, dated as of April 18, 2023 (the “Indenture”),
between the Corporation and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S. Code §§ 77aaa-77bbbb) (the “Act”). The Notes are subject to
all such terms, and Holders are referred  to the Indenture, all applicable supplemental indentures and the Act for a statement of
those terms. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities issued under the Inden ture may be issued in one or more series, which
different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at
different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or
analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture
provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Notes designated on the face hereof, unlimited in aggregate principal
amount.
5. Optional  Redemption . Prior to the Par Call Date (as defined below), the Corporation may redeem the Notes at its
option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of:
    (1)    (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments  of principal and interest thereon discounted
to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption;
and
    (2)    100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed;
plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
On or after the Par Call Date, the Corporation may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time,
at a redem ption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to the redemption date.
“Par Call Date” means April 15, 2028 (the date that is one month prior to the maturity date of the Notes.)
4
    
“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date, the yield determine d by the Corporation in accordance with the
following two paragraphs.
The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Corporation after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields
on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business
Day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day
in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as “Selected
Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15” (or any successor designation or publication) (“H.15”) under the caption “U.S. government
securities–T reasury constant maturities–Nominal” (or any successor caption or heading) (“H.15 TCM”). In determining the
Treasury Rate, the Corporation shall select, as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal
to the period from the redemption date to the applicable Par Call Date (the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no such Treasury
constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal  to the Remaining Life, the two yields – one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant
maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately
longer than the Remaining Life – and shall interpolate to the applicable Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual
number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant
maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15
closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15
shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months  or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant
maturity from the redemption date.
If on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date, H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Corporation shall
calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the second Business Day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on,
or with a maturity that is closest to, the applicable Par Call Date, as applicab le. If there is no United States Treasury security
maturing on the applicable Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally
distant from the applicable Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the applicable Par Call Date and one with a maturity
date follow ing the applicable Par Call Date, the Corporation shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date
preceding the applicable Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Par
Call Date or two or more United States  Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall
select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest
to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City
time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of the
applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage
of principal amount) at 1 1:00
5
    
a.m., New York City time, of such United States Treasury security , and rounded to three decimal places.
The Corporation’ s actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error .
6. Notice of Redemption; Partial Redem ption. Notice of any redem ption will be mailed  or electronically delivered
(or otherwise transmitted in accordance  with the Depositary’ s procedures) at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the
redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed. Any redemption or notice may, at the Corporation’ s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent and, at the Corporation’ s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such
time as any or all such conditions precedent included at the Corporation’ s discretion shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Corporation) or the redemption date may not occur and such notice may be rescinded if all such conditions precedent included at
the Corporation’ s discretion shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Corporation). In the case of a partial redemption,
selection of the Notes for redemption will be made pro rata, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion
deems appropriate and fair. No Notes of a principal amount of $2,000 or less will be redeemed in part. If any Note is to be
redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the Note will state the portion of the principal amount of the Note
to be redeemed. A new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Note will be issued in the name of the
Holder of the Note upon surrender for cancellation of the original Note. For so long as the Notes are held by DTC (or another
Depositary), the redemption of the Note s shall be done in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Depositary . Unless
the Corporation defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange . The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and $1,000 multiples above that amount. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with
the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder , among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. Also, it need not transfer or exchange any
Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or before an interest payment date.
This Note is issued in the form of a Global Security and may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes registered, and
no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any person other than the Depositary for
such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (1) such Depositary has notified the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for such Global Security or has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and a
successor Depositary is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days after the Corporation’ s receipt of such notice, (2) there
shall have  occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security and the Registrar has received a
request from the Depositary to issue certificated securities in lieu of the
6
    
Global Security , or (3) the Corporation shall determine in its sole discretion that Notes issued in global form shall no longer be
represented by a Global Security . In any such case, such Global Security may be exchanged by such Depositary for definitive
Notes of the same series, of any authorized denomination and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor , registered in the
names of, and the transfer of such Global Security or portion thereof may be registered to, such persons as such Depositary shall
direct. If the Corpor ation designates a successor Depositary pursuant to clause (1) above, such Global Security shall promptly be
exchanged in whole for one or more other Global Securities registered in the name of the successor Depositary , whereupon such
designated successor shall be the Depositary for such successor Global Security or Global Securities.
8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes,
and none of the Corporation, the Truste e, any Registrar , any Paying Agent or any co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the
contrary .
9. Unclaimed  Money . If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee
or the Paying Agen t will pay, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory provi sions of applicable abandoned property law, the
money back to the Corporation at its request. After that, Holders entitled to unclaimed money must look only to the Corporation
and not to the Trustee for payment unless an abandoned property law designates another person.

4.750% Note due 2034
1. Inter est. Lockhee d Martin Corporation (the “Corporation”), a Maryland corporation, promises to pay interest on
the princip al amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Corporation will pay interest semi-annually in arrears
on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2023. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from May 25, 2023. Interest will be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
2. Method of Payment.  The Corporation will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest, which shall be
paid as set forth below) to the persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the record date for the next
interest payment date even if the Notes  are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Any such
interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such regular record date
and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of
business on a specia l record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Corporation, notice whereof shall
be given to Holders  of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner , all as more fully provi ded in the Indenture. Holders must surrender the Notes to a Paying Agent to collect
principal payments. The Corporation will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However , the Corporat ion may pay principal and interest by its check
payable in such money . It may mail an interest check to a Holder ’s registered address. To the extent lawful, the Corporation shall
pay interest on overdue
3
    
principal at the rate borne by the Notes and shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate.
3. Paying Agent and Registrar . Initially , U.S. Bank Trust Company , National Association (the “Trustee”) will act as
Paying Agent and Registrar . The Corporation may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar .
4. Indentur e. The Corporation issued the Notes under an Indenture, dated as of April 18, 2023 (the “Indenture”),
between the Corporation and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S. Code §§ 77aaa-77bbbb) (the “Act”). The Notes are subject to
all such terms, and Holders are referred  to the Indenture, all applicable supplemental indentures and the Act for a statement of
those terms. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities issued under the Inden ture may be issued in one or more series, which
different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at
different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or
analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture
provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Notes designated on the face hereof, unlimited in aggregate principal
amount.
5. Optional  Redemption . Prior to the Par Call Date (as defined below), the Corporation may redeem the Notes at its
option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of:
    (1)    (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments  of principal and interest thereon discounted
to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points, less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption;
and
    (2)    100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed;
plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
On or after the Par Call Date, the Corporation may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time,
at a redem ption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to the redemption date.
“Par Call Date” means November 15, 2033 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes.)
“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date, the yield determine d by the Corporation in accordance with the
following two paragraphs.
4
    
The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Corporation after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields
on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business
Day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day
in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as “Selected
Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15” (or any successor designation or publication) (“H.15”) under the caption “U.S. government
securities–T reasury constant maturities–Nominal” (or any successor caption or heading) (“H.15 TCM”). In determining the
Treasury Rate, the Corporation shall select, as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal
to the period from the redemption date to the applicable Par Call Date (the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no such Treasury
constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal  to the Remaining Life, the two yields – one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant
maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately
longer than the Remaining Life – and shall interpolate to the applicable Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual
number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant
maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15
closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15
shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months  or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant
maturity from the redemption date.
If on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date, H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Corporation shall
calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the second Business Day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on,
or with a maturity that is closest to, the applicable Par Call Date, as applicab le. If there is no United States Treasury security
maturing on the applicable Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally
distant from the applicable Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the applicable Par Call Date and one with a maturity
date follow ing the applicable Par Call Date, the Corporation shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date
preceding the applicable Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Par
Call Date or two or more United States  Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall
select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest
to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City
time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of the
applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage
of principa l amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, of such United States  Treasury security , and rounded to three decimal
places.
5
    
The Corporation’ s actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error .
6. Notice of Redemption; Partial Redem ption. Notice of any redem ption will be mailed  or electronically delivered
(or otherwise transmitted in accordance  with the Depositary’ s procedures) at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the
redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed. Any redemption or notice may, at the Corporation’ s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent and, at the Corporation’ s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such
time as any or all such conditions precedent included at the Corporation’ s discretion shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Corporation) or the redemption date may not occur and such notice may be rescinded if all such conditions precedent included at
the Corporation’ s discretion shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Corporation). In the case of a partial redemption,
selection of the Notes for redemption will be made pro rata, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion
deems appropriate and fair. No Notes of a principal amount of $2,000 or less will be redeemed in part. If any Note is to be
redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the Note will state the portion of the principal amount of the Note
to be redeemed. A new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Note will be issued in the name of the
Holder of the Note upon surrender for cancellation of the original Note. For so long as the Notes are held by DTC (or another
Depositary), the redemption of the Note s shall be done in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Depositary . Unless
the Corporation defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange . The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and $1,000 multiples above that amount. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with
the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder , among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. Also, it need not transfer or exchange any
Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or before an interest payment date.
This Note is issued in the form of a Global Security and may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes registered, and
no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any person other than the Depositary for
such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (1) such Depositary has notified the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for such Global Security or has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and a
successor Depositary is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days after the Corporation’ s receipt of such notice, (2) there
shall have  occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security and the Registrar has received a
request from the Depositary to issue certificated securities in lieu of the Global Security , or (3) the Corporation shall determine in
its sole discretion that Notes issued in global form shall no longer be represen ted by a Global Security . In any such case, such
Global Security may be exchanged by such Depositary for definitive Notes of the same series, of any authorized denomination
and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor , registered in the
6
    
names of, and the transfer of such Global Security or portion thereof may be registered to, such persons as such Depositary shall
direct. If the Corpor ation designates a successor Depositary pursuant to clause (1) above, such Global Security shall promptly be
exchanged in whole for one or more other Global Securities registered in the name of the successor Depositary , whereupon such
designated successor shall be the Depositary for such successor Global Security or Global Securities.
8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes,
and none of the Corporation, the Truste e, any Registrar , any Paying Agent or any co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the
contrary .
9. Unclaimed  Money . If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee
or the Paying Agen t will pay, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory provi sions of applicable abandoned property law, the
money back to the Corporation at its request. After that, Holders entitled to unclaimed money must look only to the Corporation
and not to the Trustee for payment unless an abandoned property law designates another person.
10. Defeasance . In accordance with Article 8 of the Indenture, the Corporation may defease certain of its obligations

Limitation on Liens
    The Corporation shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur a Lien on Restricted Property to secure a
Debt unless:
7

5.200% Note due 2055
1. Inter est. Lockhee d Martin Corporation (the “Corporation”), a Maryland corporation, promises to pay interest on
the princip al amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Corporation will pay interest semi-annually in arrears
on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2023. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from May 25, 2023. Interest will be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
2. Method of Payment.  The Corporation will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest, which shall be
paid as set forth below) to the persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the record date for the next
interest payment date even if the Notes  are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Any such
interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such regular record date
and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of
business on a specia l record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Corporation, notice whereof shall
be given to Holders  of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner , all as more fully provi ded in the Indenture. Holders must surrender the Notes to a Paying Agent to collect
principal payments. The Corporation will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However , the Corporat ion may pay principal and interest by its check
payable in such money . It may mail an interest check to a Holder ’s registered address. To the extent lawful, the Corporation shall
pay interest on overdue
3
    
principal at the rate borne by the Notes and shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate.
3. Paying Agent and Registrar . Initially , U.S. Bank Trust Company , National Association (the “Trustee”) will act as
Paying Agent and Registrar . The Corporation may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar .
4. Indentur e. The Corporation issued the Notes under an Indenture, dated as of April 18, 2023 (the “Indenture”),
between the Corporation and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S. Code §§ 77aaa-77bbbb) (the “Act”). The Notes are subject to
all such terms, and Holders are referred  to the Indenture, all applicable supplemental indentures and the Act for a statement of
those terms. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities issued under the Inden ture may be issued in one or more series, which
different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at
different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or
analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture
provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Notes designated on the face hereof, unlimited in aggregate principal
amount.
5. Optional  Redemption . Prior to the Par Call Date (as defined below), the Corporation may redeem the Notes at its
option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of:
    (1)    (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments  of principal and interest thereon discounted
to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points, less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption;
and
    (2)    100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed;
plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
On or after the Par Call Date, the Corporation may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time,
at a redem ption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to the redemption date.
“Par Call Date” means August 15, 2054 (the date that is six months prior to the maturity date of the Notes.)
“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date, the yield determine d by the Corporation in accordance with the
following two paragraphs.
4
    
The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Corporation after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields
on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business
Day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day
in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as “Selected
Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15” (or any successor designation or publication) (“H.15”) under the caption “U.S. government
securities–T reasury constant maturities–Nominal” (or any successor caption or heading) (“H.15 TCM”). In determining the
Treasury Rate, the Corporation shall select, as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal
to the period from the redemption date to the applicable Par Call Date (the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no such Treasury
constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal  to the Remaining Life, the two yields – one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant
maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately
longer than the Remaining Life – and shall interpolate to the applicable Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual
number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant
maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15
closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15
shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months  or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant
maturity from the redemption date.
If on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date, H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Corporation shall
calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the second Business Day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on,
or with a maturity that is closest to, the applicable Par Call Date, as applicab le. If there is no United States Treasury security
maturing on the applicable Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally
distant from the applicable Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the applicable Par Call Date and one with a maturity
date follow ing the applicable Par Call Date, the Corporation shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date
preceding the applicable Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Par
Call Date or two or more United States  Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall
select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest
to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City
time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of the
applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage
of principa l amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, of such United States  Treasury security , and rounded to three decimal
places.
5
    
The Corporation’ s actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error .
6. Notice of Redemption; Partial Redem ption. Notice of any redem ption will be mailed  or electronically delivered
(or otherwise transmitted in accordance  with the Depositary’ s procedures) at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the
redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed. Any redemption or notice may, at the Corporation’ s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent and, at the Corporation’ s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such
time as any or all such conditions precedent included at the Corporation’ s discretion shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Corporation) or the redemption date may not occur and such notice may be rescinded if all such conditions precedent included at
the Corporation’ s discretion shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Corporation). In the case of a partial redemption,
selection of the Notes for redemption will be made pro rata, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion
deems appropriate and fair. No Notes of a principal amount of $2,000 or less will be redeemed in part. If any Note is to be
redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the Note will state the portion of the principal amount of the Note
to be redeemed. A new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Note will be issued in the name of the
Holder of the Note upon surrender for cancellation of the original Note. For so long as the Notes are held by DTC (or another
Depositary), the redemption of the Note s shall be done in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Depositary . Unless
the Corporation defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange . The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and $1,000 multiples above that amount. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with
the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder , among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. Also, it need not transfer or exchange any
Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or before an interest payment date.
This Note is issued in the form of a Global Security and may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes registered, and
no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any person other than the Depositary for
such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (1) such Depositary has notified the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for such Global Security or has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and a
successor Depositary is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days after the Corporation’ s receipt of such notice, (2) there
shall have  occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security and the Registrar has received a
request from the Depositary to issue certificated securities in lieu of the Global Security , or (3) the Corporation shall determine in
its sole discretion that Notes issued in global form shall no longer be represen ted by a Global Security . In any such case, such
Global Security may be exchanged by such Depositary for definitive Notes of the same series, of any authorized denomination
and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor , registered in the
6
    
names of, and the transfer of such Global Security or portion thereof may be registered to, such persons as such Depositary shall
direct. If the Corpor ation designates a successor Depositary pursuant to clause (1) above, such Global Security shall promptly be
exchanged in whole for one or more other Global Securities registered in the name of the successor Depositary , whereupon such
designated successor shall be the Depositary for such successor Global Security or Global Securities.
8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes,
and none of the Corporation, the Truste e, any Registrar , any Paying Agent or any co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the
contrary .
9. Unclaimed  Money . If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee
or the Paying Agen t will pay, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory provi sions of applicable abandoned property law, the
money back to the Corporation at its request. After that, Holders entitled to unclaimed money must look only to the Corporation
and not to the Trustee for payment unless an abandoned property law designates another person.
10. Defeasance . In accordance with Article 8 of the Indenture, the Corporation may defease certain of its obligations
with respect to the Notes or dischar ge its obligations with respect to the Notes by, among other things, irrevocably depositing
