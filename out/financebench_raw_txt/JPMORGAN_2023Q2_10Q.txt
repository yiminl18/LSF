Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the second

otherwise specified.
Firmwide overview 
For the second  quarter of 2023 , JPMorgan Chase reported 
net income of $14.5 billion, up 67%, earnings per share of 
$4.75, ROE of 20% and ROTCE of 25% . The Fi rm's results 
for the second quarter of 2023 included an estimated 
bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion in Corporate and a net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses of $1.2 billion 
associated with the First Republic acquisition. The Firm's 
results also included investment securities losses of $900 
million in Treasury and CIO. 
•Total net revenue  was $41.3 billion, up 34%, reflecting:
–Net interest income of $21.8 billion, up 44%, driven by 
higher rates and,  to a lesser extent, t he impact of the 
First Republic acquisition, partially offset by lower 
Markets net interest income and lower average deposit balances. Net interest income excluding Markets was 
$22.4 billion, up 63%.
–Noninterest revenue was $19.5 billion, up 25%, driven 
by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, higher 
Markets non interest revenue and the absence of losses 
on equity investments in Payments in the prior year, 
partially offset by higher net investment securities 
losses in Treasury and CIO. The impact of the First 
Republic acquisition included a $2.7 billion estimated 
bargain purchase gain in Corporate. 
–Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower 
Markets NII, largely offset by higher NIR.
•Noninterest expense  was $20.8 billion, up 11%, driven 
by higher compensation expense due to additional 
headcount and the impact of wage inflation, $599 million 
expense associated with  the First Republic acquisition, 
higher technology and marketing investments and higher 
legal expense.
5
•The provision for credit losses  was $2.9 billion, 
reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the allowance for 
credit losses and $1.4 billion of net charge-offs. The net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses included $1.2 
billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic 
loans and lending-related commitments. The net addition 
also reflected:
–$233 million in consumer predominantly in  Card 
Services, and
–$79 million in  wholesale reflecting $389 million in CB, 
largely offset by a $243 million reduction in Corporat e.
Net charge-offs increased $754 million, predominantly 
driven by CCB, primarily Card Services , as 30+ day 
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
The prior year included a $428 million net addition to the 
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $657 
million.
•The total allowance for credit losses  was $ 24.3 billion at 
June 30, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses 
to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.75%, compared 
with 1.69% in the prior year.
•The Firm’s nonperforming assets  totaled $7.8 billion at 
June 30, 2023, relatively flat from the prior year, as 
lower consumer nonaccrual loans due to loan sales in the 
prior year were offset by higher wholesale nonaccrual 
loans, reflecting client-specif ic downgrades . Refer to 
Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 70-79  for additional 
information.
•Firmwide  average loans  of $1.2 trillion were up 13%, 
driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, largely as a result  
of the First Republic acquisition. 
•Firmwid e average deposits  of $2.4 trillion were down 
6%, driven by: 
–the continued migration into higher-yielding 
investments in AWM; declines in CIB and CB primarily 
due to continued deposit attrition, which for CIB 
included actions to reduce certain deposits; and  a net 
decline in CCB primarily f rom existing accounts due to 
increased customer spending,
partially offset by
–the impact of the First Republic acquisition  in CCB, and 
an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's 
international consumer initiatives.

Recent events
•Basel III Finalization: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve,  
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and 
the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based 
capital framework, entitl ed "Regulatory capital rule: 
Amendments applicable to large banking organizations 
and to banking organizations with significant trading 
activity". Under the proposal, changes would include 
replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded 
risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of 
internal models for the calculation of risk-weighted 
assets, other than for Market risk. In addition, the stress 
capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both 
the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized 
approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk-
based capital requirements for all banks with assets of 
$100 billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. 
global systemically important banks ("GSIBs"). The 
proposed effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three year 
transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based 
approach.
•GSIB Surcharge: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also 
released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB 
surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments 
would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on an 
annual basis, using the average of the quarterly 
surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year, with 
daily averaging required for certain measures within the 
surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments would be 
reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there would also be 
other technical amendments to the Method 2 calculation. 
The proposed amendments would revise risk-based 
capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, 
and would become effective on two calendar quarters 
after the adoption of the final rule.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53  for 
additional information.Outlook
These current  expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, 
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties . Refer to 
Forward-Looking Statements on page 95 of this Form 10-Q; 
Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32  of the 2022  Form 
10-K; and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on page 209  of this 
Form 10-Q  for a further discussion of certain of those risks 
and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause 
JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because 
of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that 
actual results in 2023 will be in line with the outlook 
information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake 
to update any forward-looking statements.
JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023 should 
be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. 
economies,  financial markets activity, the geopolitical 
environment, the competitive environment, client and 
customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative 
developments in the U.S. and other countries where the 
Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the 
performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make 
appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in 
response to ongoing developments in the business, 
economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it 
operates.
In May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking recommending a special assessment related to 
the systemic risk determination made on March 12, 2023, 
to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") 
arising from the protection of uninsured depositors 
resulting from recent bank resolutions. In its current form, 
the rule would impose a special assessment at an annual 
rate of 12.5 basis points on certain banks’ estimated 
uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022.  If 
this rule is finalized as proposed, the Firm expects to 
recognize an estimated assessment expense of 
approximately $3 billion (pre-tax) in the quarter in which 
the rule is finalized, which is expected to occur in the 
second half of 2023.
Full-year 2023
•Management expects both net interest income and net 
interest income excluding Markets to be approximately 
$87 billion, market dependent .
•Management expects adjusted expense to be 
approximately $8 4.5 billion, market dependent and 
excluding any FDIC special assessment .
•Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card 
Services to be approximately 2.6 %.
Net interest income excl uding Markets and adjusted 
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 .

Business Developments 
First Republic acquisition
On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets 
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the 
"First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver, for $67.9 
billion , resulting in an estimated bargain purchase gain of 
$2.7 billion  recorded in other income. In connection with 
the First Republic acquisition, the Firm issued a five-year, 
$50 billion  secured not e to the FDIC (the "Purchase Money 
Note"), and entered into shared-loss agreements with the 
FDIC with respect to certain loans acquired and lending-
related commitments assumed in the acquisition . Refer to 
Note 28 for additional information.
JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of 
and for the period ended June 30, 2023 reflect the impact 
of the First Republic acquisition . Where meaningful to the 
disclosure, the impact of the First  Republic acquisition is 
disclosed in various sections of this Form 10-Q. The Firm 
continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate 
clients, products and services, associated with the First 
Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and 
operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which 
segments certain clients, products and services associated 
with the First Republic acquisition, including deposits, 
should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications 
and allocations may change in future periods, including 
across the Firm's segments .
Current market and economic conditions
Refer to Part I , Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32  of 
JPMorgan Chase's 2022  Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, 
Risk Factors on page 209 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion 
of material risk factors that could affect the Firm. These risk 
factors include potential impacts to the Firm associated 
with current market and economic conditions, including 
inflationary pressures, high er interest rates and geopolitical 
tensions (including secondary effects of the war in Ukraine), 
any or all of which could result in additional market 
disruption, government actions (including with respect to 
monetary policies), ongoing impacts to global supply 
chains, and other geopolitical risks.Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
The publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. 
dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-
month and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June 30, 2023 
(“LIBOR Cessation”). The one-month, three-month and six-
month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be 
published on a "synthetic" basis, which will allow market 
participants to use such rates for certain legacy LIBOR-
linked contracts through September 30, 2024.
In the second quarter of 2023, the Firm successfully 
converted predominantly all of its cleared derivatives 
contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR to the Secured 
Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as part of initiatives by the 
principal central counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared 
derivatives prior to LIBOR Cessation. Nearly all of the Firm’s 
other U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked products that remained 
outstanding at LIBOR Cessation will be remediated through 
contractual fallback provisions or through the framework 
provided by the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act 
(“LIBOR Act”). The Firm continues its client outreach 
activities with respect to the limited amount of  contracts 
that continue to reference “synthetic” U.S. dollar LIBOR in 
order to complete remediation by September 30, 2024.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees  decreased in CIB, reflecting:
•lowe r advis ory fees due to  a lower level of announced 
deals  in prior p eriods amid a challenging environment,  
largely offset by 
•higher equity  underwriting fees primarily due to higher 
convertible securities offerings and, in the second half of 
the quarter, follow-on offerings that benefited from the 
lower equity market  volatility . 
Refer to C IB segment results on pages 30-36  and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue  increased, reflecting:
•higher Equity Markets revenue in principal transactions, 
primarily  in Prime Finance,
•higher Fixed Income Markets revenue in principal 
transactions, driven by Securitized Products and Fixed 
Income Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in 
Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets,
–the increase in Markets principal transactions revenue 
was more than offset by a decline in Markets NII, 
primarily due to higher funding costs
•the absence of $337 million of markdowns in the prior 
year on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded 
commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and 
CB,
•a gain of $36 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in 
CIB, compared with a loss of $218 million in the prior 
year,  and•higher revenue  related to cash deployment transactions 
in Treasury and CIO,
partially offset by
•net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in 
Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets 
across other revenue lines, including net interest income. 
The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business 
on a total net revenue basis.

•lower cash management fees in CIB and CB associated 
with the higher level of credits earned by clients that 
reduce such fees,
largely offset by
•higher lending -related fees driven by the impact of the 
First Republic acquisition in AWM a nd CCB .
Refer to CIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages 30-36 , 
pages 37-40  and pages 41-44 , respectively, and Note 6 for

securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. R efer to Corporate 
segment results on pages 45-46  and Note 10 for additional 
information.
Mortgage fees and related income decreased in Home 
Lending, reflecting lower production revenue due to a 
decline in volume, and lower net mortgage servicing  
revenue . Refer to CCB segment results on pages 25-29  and 
Notes 6 and 15 for additional information.
Card income  decreased driven by:
•lower  net interchange income as a resul t of an increase to 
the rewards liability due to adjustments to the terms of 
certain reward programs in CCB ,
largely offset by
•higher payments- related r evenue, reflecting growth in 
Commercial Card in CIB and CB.
Refer t o CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 25-29 , 
pages 30-36  and pages 37-40 , respectively, Critical 
Accounting Estimates on pages 91-93 , and Note 6 for

Other income  incre ased, reflecting: 
•the $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain 
associated with the First Republic acquisition in 
Corporate,
•the absence of losses on equity investments in Payments 
in the prior year, and
•the impa ct of net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO ,
partially offset by

method investment received in partial satisfaction of a 
loan in CB .
Refer to Business Segment Results on page 24  and Note 28 
for additional information on the First Republic acquisition;

measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the 
Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21

Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees  decreased in CIB, reflecting:
•lower debt underwriting fees as challenging market 
conditions resulted in lower issuance activity in 
acquisition financing , and
•lower advisory fees due to a lower level of announced 
deals in prior periods amid a challenging environment,  
partially offset by
•higher equity  underwriting fees primarily due to higher 
convertible securities offerings and, in the second half of 
the second quarter, follow-on offerings that benefited 
from the lower equity market volatility.
Principal transactions revenue  increased, reflecting:
•higher Fixed Income Markets net revenue in principal 
transactions,  driven by Securitized Products and Fixed 
Income Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in 
Currencies & Emerging Markets  and Rates ,
•higher Equity Markets revenue in principal transactions, 
primarily in Prime Finance,
–the increase in Markets principal transactions revenue 
was more than offset by a decline in Markets NII, 
primarily due to higher funding costs
•losses of $117 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in 
CIB, driven by losses on certain components of fair value 
option elected liabilities,  compared with losses of $742 
million in the prior year,  and
•higher revenue related to cash deployment transactions 
in Treasury and CIO.
Lending- and deposit-related fees  decr eased due to:
•lower cash management fees in CB and CIB associated 
with the higher level of credits earned by clients that 
reduce such fees,
partially offset by
•higher lending-related fees driven by the impact of the 
First Republic acquisition  in AWM and CCB .
Asset management fees  increased driven by the impact of 
the First Republic acquisition in CCB.
Asset management  fees in AWM was relatively flat, as the 
decline in market levels was predominantly offset by the 
removal of most money market fund fee waivers and the 
impact of net inflows.
Commissions  and other fees  was relatively flat. Refer to 
CIB and AWM segment results on pages 30-36  and pages 
41-44 , respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.

sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government 
agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment 
securities portfolio in both periods in Treasury and CIO.
Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by 
11
Home Lending, reflecting lower production revenue due to a 
decline in volume, and lower net mortgage servicing 
revenue due to lower net gains in MSR risk management.
Card income  increased driven by higher payments-related 
revenue, reflecting  growth i n Commercial Card in CIB and 
CB.
Net interchange in come in CCB was relatively flat as the 
benefit in partner payments in the first quarter of 2023 
related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed 
was offset by an increase to the rewards liability due to 
adjustments to the terms of certain reward programs .
Other income  increased, reflecting: 
•the $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain 
associated with the First Republic acquisition in 
Corporate,
•the impact of net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO , 
and
•a gain of $339 million recognized in first quarter of 2023 
in AWM on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the 
Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the 
entity,
partially offset by
•lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a decline 
in volume,
•the absence of proceeds in the prior year from an 
insurance settlement,
•the absence of a gain in the prior year on an equity-
method investment received in partial satisfaction of a 
loan in CB, and
•lower net gains related to certain other Corporate 
investments .
Net interest income  increased driven by higher rates and, 
to a lesser extent, higher revolving balances in Card 
Services and the impact from the First Republic acquisition, 
partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and 
lower average deposit balances.

Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses  was $2.9 billion, reflec ting a 
$1.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
and $1.4 billion of net charge-offs. 
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included 
$1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic 
loans and lending -related commitments, composed of $763 
million in wholesale  and $400 million in consumer .
The net addition also reflected:
•$233 million in consumer predominantly in  Card 
Services , and
•$79 million in  wholesale reflecting $389 million in CB , 
largely offset by a $243 million reduction in Corporate. 
Net charge-offs increased $754 million, predominantly 
driven by CCB, primarily Card  Services, as 30 + day 
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels .
The prior year included a $428 million net addition to the 
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $657 
million.

The provision  for credit losses  was $5.2 billion, reflecting a  
$2.6 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
and $2.5 billion of net charge-offs. 
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses  included 
$1.5 billion, consisting of:
•$800 million in wholesale, predominantly driven by net 
downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions 
related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter of 
2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed on 
the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, and
•$649 million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card 
Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of changes 
in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the 
impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment 
rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the 
additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the 
first quarter of 2023, partially offset by reduced 
borrower uncertainty.
The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the 
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments, in the second quarter of 2023.
Net charge-offs increased $1.3 billion, predominantly 
driven by CCB, primarily Card  Services,  as 30+ day 
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels.
The prior year included a $1.3 billion net addit ion to the 
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $1.2

Total assets $ 3,868,240 $ 3,665,743  6 %
Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
decreased primarily as a result of the First Republic 
acquisition, which included the impact of the repayment of 
deposits provided to First Republic Bank in March 2023 by 
the consortium of large U.S. banks and amounts paid to the 
FDIC, as well as CIB Markets ac tivities. Deposits with banks 
reflect the Firm’s placement of its excess cash with various 
central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements  increased due to the impact of a lower level of 
netting on a reduced level of resale balances in Markets.
Securities borrowed  decreased driven by Markets , 
reflecting lower client-driven activities and lower demand 
for securities to cover short positions.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.
Trading  assets  incr eased due to higher levels of debt and 
equity instruments in Markets, in response to demand from 
client-driven market-making activities, and when compared 
with the seasonally lower levels at year-end . Refer to Notes 
2 and 5 for additional information.
Investme nt securities  decreased due to:
•lower available-for-sale ("AFS") securities driven by 
paydowns, maturities and net sales, partially offset by 
$25.8 billion of securities associated with the First 
Republic acquisition as well as  the transfer  of securities 
from held-to-maturity in the first quarter of 2023 
(“HTM”), and
•lower HTM securities driven by paydowns, maturities and 
the transfer  of securities to AFS.
Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 45-46 , Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 83, and 
Notes 2 and 10 for additional information.
Loans  increased, reflecting :
•$150 billion of loans associated with the First Republic 
acquisition, primarily reflected  in CCB, CB and AWM.
The increase also included:
•growth in new accounts and revolving balance s which 
continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels  in Card 
Services , and
•higher revolver utilization and originations in CB,
partially offset by
•lower securities-based lending in AWM.
The allowance for loan losses  increased, reflecting:
•a net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $1.8 
billion, consisting of:
–$1.1 billion in wholesale,  predominantly driven by net 
downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions 
related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter 
of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed 
on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, 
and
–$620 million in consumer , predominantly driven by 
Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of 
changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, 
including the impact from the weighted average U.S. 
unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 
2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset 
by reduced borrower uncertainty, and
•$1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the First 
Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023.
16
The allowance for loan losses also reflected a reduction of 
$587  million , on January 1, 2023, as a result of the 
adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: 
Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance. 
References in this Form 10-Q to "changes to the TDR 
accounting guidance" pertain to the Firm's adoption of this 
guidance.
There was also a $ 196 million net reduction in the 
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in 
other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which 
included a $97 million addition to establish the allowance 
for the First Republic lending-related commitments .
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
62-83 , and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for additional 
information on loans and the total allowance for credit 
losses; and Business Segment Results on page 24  and Note 
28 for additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition.Accrued interest and accounts receivable  decreased 
primarily due to l ower client receivables r elated to client-
driven activities in Markets .
Premises and equipm ent increas ed as a result o f the  First 
Republic acquisition , largely  lease right-of-use assets, and 
the construction-in-process associated with the Firm 's 
headquarters. Refer to  Note 17 for information on leases.
Goodwill , MSRs and other intangible assets  increased 
predominantly due to the other intangibles and goodwill 
related to the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% 
interest in CIFM, and the core deposit intangibles associated 
with the First Republic acquisition . Refer to N ote 15 and 28 
for additional information.
Other assets  decreased reflecting lower cash collateral 
placed with central counterparties ("CCPs").

Deposits  increased, reflecting:
•increases in CIB due to deposit inflows related to client-
driven activities and net issuances of structured notes as 
a result of client demand,
•$68 billion of deposits in CCB associated with the First 
Republic acquisition, partially offset by a net decline 
primarily in existing accounts due to increased customer 
spending,  and
•an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's 
international consumer initiatives,
partially offset by
•the continued migration into higher-yielding investments 
in AWM as a result of the rising interest rate environment , 
and
•ongoing attrition in CB driven by higher rates and 
seasonal outflows, predominantly offset by inflows as a 
result of disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 
2023 .
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements  increased due to  higher 
secured financing of trading assets and th e impact of a 
lower level of netting on client-driven market-making 
activities in Markets.Short-term borrowings  decreased predominantly as a 
resul t of lower financing requirements in Markets , partially 
offset by short-term FHLB advances associated with the 
First Republic acquisition in Treasury and CIO.

information.
Accounts payable and other liabilities  decreased primarily 
due to lower client paya bles related to client-driven

driven by higher levels of Firm-adminis tered multi-seller 
conduit  commercial paper held by third parties, reflecting 
changes in the Firm’s short-term liquidity management, and 
an increase in loans in the conduits in CIB. Refer to Liquidity 
Risk Management on pages 54-61  and Notes 14 and 24 for 
additional information, specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and 
loan securitization trusts.
17
Long-term debt  increased, reflecting the impact of the First 
Republic acquisition, which included the Purchase Money 
Note  issued to the FDIC,  and $25  billion of FHLB advanc es, 
partially offset by maturities  and redemptions in Treasury 
and CIO . Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
54-61 ; and Note 28 for additional informatio n on the First

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.
The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21  for a 
definition of managed basis.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses 
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an 
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business 
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and 
analysts in assessing performance. 
Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the 
participating business segments may agree to share 
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally 
recognized in the segment responsible for the related 
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) 
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect 
these revenue-sharing agreements.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the 
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and 
Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk 
and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. 
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest 
rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and 
liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the 
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process 
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other 
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest 
income to the segments.Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and 
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues 
and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks 
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate 
movements related to the transferred risk in its results. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 84-89  for 
additional information.
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is 
referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, 
judgments and methodologies  used to allocate capital are 
reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the 
LOBs may change.  As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated 
its line of business capital allocations to reflect the impact 
of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Line of business 
equity on  page 51, and  page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 
Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.
Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62  and Note 
32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of those methodologies.

          Quarterly results 
Net income was $5.3 billion , up 71% .
Net revenue was $17.2 billion , an increase of 37% . 
Net interest income was $13.7 billion , up 57% , driven by:
•deposit margin expansion on higher rates in Banking & 
Wealth Management ("BWM"),  and
•higher NII in Card Ser vices driven by increased revolving 
balances.
Noninterest revenue was $3.5 billion , down 8%, driven by:
•lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 
in volume, and
•a decrease in card income driven by lower net interchange, 
as a result of an increase to t he rewards liability due to 
adjustments to certain reward program terms, 
partially offset by
•higher  asset management fees in BWM predominantly 
driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition.
Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income, 
asset management fees, and commissions and other fees; 
and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 91-93  for card 
income.
Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income. 
Noninterest expense was $8.3 billion , up 9%, driven by:
•higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and 
headcount growth , as well as higher marketing  and 
technology,
partially offset by
•lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease assets.
The provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion , and included:
•net charge-offs of $1.3 billion , up $640 million , 
predominantly driven by Card Services, as 30+ day 
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and
•a $611 million net additi on to the allowance for credit 
losses, reflecting $408 million to establish the allowance 
for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments. The net addition also included $203 million 
driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, and the 
net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, 
including the impact from the weighted average U.S. 
unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, 
largely offset by  reduced borrower uncertainty.
The prior year included a $150 million addition to the 
allowance for credit losses in Card Services.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
62-83  and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 80-82  for a 
further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance 
for credit losses.Year-to-date results  
Net income was $10.5 billion , up 75% . 
Net revenue was $33.7 billion , an increase of 36% . 
Net interest income was $26.5 billion , up 56% , driven by:
•deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset 
by lower average deposits in BWM, and
•higher NII in Card Services driven by increased revolving 
balances,
partially offset by
•the impact of lower PPP loan forgiveness in BWM . 
Noninterest revenue was $7.2 billion , down 7%, driven by:
•lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 
in volume and
•in Home Lending, lower production revenue from a decline 
in volume and lower net mortgage servicing revenue 
predominantly driven by lower net gains on MSR risk 
management,
partially offset by
•higher  travel-related commissions in Card Services,
•higher asset managemen t fees in BWM  driven by the 
impact of the First Republic acquisition.
Card income was relativel y flat as the increase in net 
interchange in the first quarter of 2023 due to a reduction in 
rewards costs and partner payments related to a periodic tax 
refund on airline miles redeemed was offset by an increase 
to the rewards liability due to ad justments to certain reward 
program terms  in the second quarter of 2023.
Noninterest expense was $16.4 billion , up 7%, driven by:
•higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and 
headcount growth, as well as higher marketing and 
technology,
partially offset by
•lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease assets.
The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion , and included:
•net charge-offs of $2.3 billion , up $1.1 billion , 
predominantly driven by Card Services, as 30+ day 
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and
•a $553 million net addition, predominantly driven by Card 
Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of changes 
in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact 
from the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the additional 
weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter 
of 2023, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty, 
and
•a $408 million net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses to establish the allowance for the First Republic 
loans and lending-related commitments, in the second 
quarter of 2023.  
The prior year included a $275 million addition to the 
allowance for credit losses in Card Services and Home 
Lending.

as challenging market conditions resulted in lower 
issuance  activit y in the leveraged loan market primarily 
related to acquisition financing.
–Equity underwriting fees were $318 million , up 30% , 
primarily due to higher convertible securities offerings 
and, in the second half of the quarter, follow-on 
offerings that benefited from the lower equity market 
volatility. 
•Payments revenue was $2.5 billion , up 61% . Excluding 
the net impact of equity investments, Payments revenue 
was up 32%, driven  by deposit margin expansion on

predominantly driven by lower revenue in Equity 
Derivatives, compared to a strong second quarter in the

driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, 
largely offset by lower fees and lower average deposits.
•Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain  of $36 million , 
compared with a loss of $218 million  in the prior year, 
largely driven by funding spread widening.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets 
revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K 
for further information.
For the periods presented below, the primary source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transaction s.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion , up 22% .  
Net revenue was $4.0 billion , up 49% . Net interest income 
was $3.2 billion , up 77% , predominantly driven by deposit 
margin expansion on higher rates and higher average loans, 
partially offset by lower average deposits.
Noninterest revenue was $835 million , down 8%, driven by 
lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level of credits 
earned by clients that reduce such fees, partially offset by 
higher card income . 
Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion , up 12% , 
predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, 
including headcount growth, as well as higher  volume-
related expense.
The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion , reflecting 
an addition of $608 million to establish the allowance for 
the First Republ ic loans and lending-related commitments. 
The net addition also reflected $389 millio n driven by 
updates to certain assumptions related to office real estate, 
as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking . 
The prior year provision was $209 million .

was $5.9 billion , up 78% , driven by deposit margin 
expansion on higher rates and higher average loans,

lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level of credits 
earned by clients that reduce such fees, partially offset by

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion , up 14% , largely 
driven by higher compensation expense, including

an addition of $608 million to establish the allowance for 
the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments, 
in the second quarter of 2023. The net addition also

higher rates , partially offset by lower Firmwide average 
deposit balances available for deployment in Treasury and 
CIO .

of $244 million  in the prior year, driven by:  
•a $2.7 billion  estimated bargain purchase ga in assoc iated 
with the First Republic acquisition
•higher revenue related to cash deployment transactions in 
Treasury and CIO, and
•higher losses  in the prior year on certain revenues 
associated with foreign exchange rate movements ,partially offset by
•higher  net investment securities losses on sales of U.S.

associated with repositioning the investment securities 
portfolio , and 
•net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in

45
expense were not material to net income. Refer to Foreign 
Exchange Risk on page 22 for additional information.

million , reflecting a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses associated with the deposit placed with First Republic 
Bank in the first quarter of 2023. 
Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the 
investment securities portfolio, and Note 13 for additional 
information on the allowance for credit losses.
The current period tax expense benefited from the income

•higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues 
associated with foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by 
•higher net investment securities losses related to the sales

MBS, associated with repositioning the investment 
securities portfolio,  
•the absence of proceeds in the prior year from an 
insurance settlement, and
•lower net gains related to certain other Corporate 
investments.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT 
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors, and 
protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. 
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 
•Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 
•Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 
•A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure. 
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 
Refer to pages 86-96  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-
K, Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
capital risk.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S.  Bank Holding Companies  
(“BHCs” ) and banks, including the Firm and its insured 
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries,  including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of 
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), 
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive 
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a 
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an 
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the 
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is 
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approac hes compared to their respective 
regulatory capital ratio requirements.  The Firm’s Basel III 
Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding 
than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.  
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 51  for additional 
information.
Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition
Beginning January 1, 202 2, the $ 2 . 9  b i l l i o n CECL capital 
benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25%  per year 
over a three-year period.  As of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm's 
CET1 capital reflected the remaining $ 1 . 4  b i l l i o n benefit 
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.
Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm phased 
out 50% of the other CECL capital transition provisions 
which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, 
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.  
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  and Note 
1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further 
information on CECL capital transition provisions and the 
CECL accounting guidance.Risk-based Capital Targets
The Firm’s  target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital 
ratio for the first quarter of 2024 remains at 13.5%. The 
Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary from the target 
dependent on market conditions. The target is based on the 
Basel III capital rules currently in effect.
Base l III Finalization
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve,  the OCC and the FDIC 
released a p roposal to amend the risk-based capital 
framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule: Amendments 
applicable to large banking organizations and to banking 
organizations with significant trading activity". Under the 
proposal, changes would include replacement of the 
advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, 
which would not permit the use of internal models for the 
calculation of risk-weighted assets, other than for Market 
risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would 
be applicable to both the expanded risk-based approach 
and the standardized approach. The proposal would 
significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all 
banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the 
Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The proposed effective date is 
July 1, 2025 with a three year transition period applicable 
to the expanded risk -based approach.
GSIB Surcharge
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal 
to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted 
as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to 
assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the 
average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout 
the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain 
measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge 
increments would be reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there 
would also be other technical amendments to the Method 2 
calculation. The proposed amendments would revise risk-
based capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. 
GSIBs, and would become effective on two calendar 
quarters after the adoption of the final rule.  Refer to Risk-
based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages 89-90 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information 
on the GSIB surcharge.

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced 
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  
Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics. Refer to Note 23 for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s risk-based and 
leverage-based capital metrics. First Republic  Bank was not subject to Advanced approach regulatory capital requirements. As 
a result, for certain exposures associated with the First Republic acquisition, Advanced RWA and any impact on Advanced Total 
capital is calculated under the Standardized approach as permitted by the transition provisions in the U.S. capital rules. Refer

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
On April 5, 2023, the Firm submitted its 2023 Capital Plan 
to the Federal Reserve. On June 30, 2023, the Firm 
announced that it had completed the Federal Reserve's 
2023 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) 
stress test process.
On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve announced the 
Firm's 2023 SCB requirement of 2.9% (down from the 
current 4.0%), which will result in a Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, of 
11.4% (down from the current 12.5%) for the fourth 
quarter of 2023. The SCB requirement will become 
effective on October 1, 2023 and will remain in effect until 
September 30, 2024.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
Liquidity risk  is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104  of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk.
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible  HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress.  
Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-
alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not 
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from 
the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.  The LCR for both the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%.  
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended  
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, M a r c h  3 1 ,  2 0 2 3 and J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2 based 
on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.

2022 , respectively.
The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months 
ended June 30, 2023, compared with the three months 
period ended March 31, 2023, due to long-term debt 
maturities, c ommon stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid, predominantly offset b y a dividend payment 
from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to  the Parent Company.
The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months 
ended June 30, 2023, compared with the prior year period, 
driven by dividend payments  from JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. to the Parent Company , partially offset by common 
stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during 
the three months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, compared with the 
three months ended M a r c h  3 1 ,  2 0 2 3, reflecting an 
approximate 50% decline associated with the First Republic 
acquisition, reducing HQLA and increasing net cash 
outflows. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA  was further 
impacted by a reduction in cash primarily driven by higher 
average loans, a dividend payment to the Parent Company, 
and a decline in average deposits.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three 
months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 decreased when compared 
with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease 
in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a 
reduction in cash from a decline in average deposits and 
loan growth, as well as lower market values of HQLA-
eligible inv estment securities and the impact of the First 
Republic acquisition. 
Refer to Note 10 and Note 28 for ad ditional information on 
the Firm's investment securities portfolio and the First 
Republic acquisition .
Actions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor 
behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, 
including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR  may fluctuate 
from period to period due to changes in their respective 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of 
Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors.  
Refer to page 98  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K and 
the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional 
information on HQLA and net cash outflows.
Internal stress testing
The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing  that is 
intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal 
entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse 
scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s 
resolution and recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios 
are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are 
performed in response to specific market events or 
concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the 
formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its 
liquidity position.
The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the 
Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating 
subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk 
tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to 
54
manage through periods of stress when access to normal 
funding sources may be disrupted.
Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, 
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. 
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was 
approximately  $620 billion  and $694 billion  as of J u n e  3 0 ,  
2023  and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively, although the 
amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular 
time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions . 
The decrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven 
by a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., largely offset  by an increase in 
CIB trading assets and AFS securities associated with the 
First Republic acquisition. 
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the  
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of 
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $332 billion  and $323 billion  as of  J u n e  3 0 ,  
2023  and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively. This borrowing 
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities 
reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered 
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve 
Banks discount window and other central banks.  Although 
available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at 
the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other 
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.
NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable 
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts 
of stable funding over a one-year horizon.  
As of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR 
requirement, based on the Firm's current interpretation of 
the final rule. By the end of August 2023, the Firm will be 
required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR on 
a semiannual basis .
55
Funding  
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- 
and long-term cash requirements.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term 
secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured 
long-term debt, or from borrowings from  the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from 
long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured 
borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested 
by Treasury and CIO  in the Firm’s investment securities 
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid 
investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk 
characteristics.  
Refer to Note 24 for additional information on off-balance 
sheet obligations.
Deposits

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of 
funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale 
funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits 
are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, 
which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. 
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to 
be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated 
from customers that maintain operating service 
relationships with the Firm .
The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of 
market disruption those trends could be affected.
Average deposits were lower for the three months ended 
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 compared to the three months ended 
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2. The decrease was driven by:
•the continued migration into higher-yielding investments 
in AWM as a result of the rising interest rate environment,
•continued deposit  attrition in CIB, including actions to 
reduce certain deposits, partially offset by net issuances 
of structured notes as a result of client demand, 
•continued deposit attrition in CB, partially offset by 
continued  inflows  as a result of disruptions in the market 
in the first quarter of 2023,  and
•a net decline in CCB primarily from existing accounts due 
to increased customer sp ending , largely offset by  the 
impact of the First Republic acquisition ,
partially offset by  •an increase in Corporate  related to the Firm's 
international consumer initiatives.
Average deposits were lower for the six months ended 
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 compared to the six months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  
2022 . The decrease was driven by:
•the continued migration  into higher-yielding investments 
in AWM as a result of the rising interest rate environment,
•continued deposit attrition in CIB, including actions to 
reduce certain deposits, partially offset by net issuances 
of structured notes as a result of client demand,
•continued deposit attrition in CB, partially offset by 
continued inflows as a result of disruptions in the market 
in the first quarter of 2023, and 
•a net decline in CCB primarily from existing accounts due 
to increased customer spending, partially offset by the 
impact of the First Republic acquisition,
partially offset by
•an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's 
international consumer initiatives.
56
Period-end deposits increased, reflecting :
•increases in CIB due to deposit inflows related to client-
driven activities and net issuances of structured notes as 
a result of client dem and,
•$68 billion  of deposits in CCB associated with the First 
Republic acquisition, partially offset by a net decline 
primarily in existing accounts due to increased customer 
spending,  and
•an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's 
international consumer initiatives,  
partially offset by
•the continued migrati on into higher-yielding investments 
in AWM as a result of the rising interest rate environment , 
and
•ongoing  attrition  in CB driven by higher rates and 
seasonal outflows, predominantly offset by inflows as a 
result of disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 
2023 .
Refer to the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis 
and the Business Segment Results on pages 16-19  and 
pages 22-46 , respectively, for further information on 
deposit and liability balance trends. Refer to Note 3 for 
further information on structured notes.Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that 
provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit 
to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available 
to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are 
placed. For example, the FDIC  provides deposit insurance 
protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository 
institution. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022(a), 
the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were $1,381.1 
billion  and $1,353.1 billion , respectively, primarily 
reflecting wholesale operating deposits. 
Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table 
below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. 
time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s 
estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on 
data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable 
FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non-
U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.  
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 
at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, compared with D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, due 
to higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact 
of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-making 
activities in Markets.
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.  The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding 
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds.  
The decrease in commercial paper at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 from 
December 31, 2022, and for the average three and six 
months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 compared to the prior year 
periods, was due to lower net issuance levels  resulting from 
short-term liquidity management.
The decrease in average unsecured other borrowed funds 
for the three and six months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 
compared to the prior year periods was due to  a lower level 
of overdrafts as well as net maturities of structured notes 
classified as other borrowed funds in CIB.
59
Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan 
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including  TLAC . Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.  
The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in 
support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries.  The Parent Company advances substantially all net 
funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties.  The following table 
summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended  June 30, 2023 
and 2022 . Refer to Note 18 of this Form 10-Q and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104  of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2022  
Form 10-K  for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.
Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Note 5 and Note 14 
for additional information.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, were

On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR 
accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and 
disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement 
to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or 
involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure 
for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate 
reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term 
extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm 
has defined these types of modifications as financial 
difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the 
elimination of the requirement to assess whether a 
modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs will 
differ from those previously considered TDRs. Refer to Note 
1 and Note 12 for further information. Total credit portfolio

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased compared to D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2 driven 
by residential  real estate loans  associated with the  First 
Republic acquis ition  and higher auto loans.
Residential real estate:  The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit.
Retained loans increased compared to D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, 
reflecting reside ntial real estate loans associated with the 
First Republic acquisition . Retained nonaccrual loans 
decreased compared to D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. Net recoveries 
were lower for the  three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  
2023  compared to the same periods in the prior year 
driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates. 
Loans at fair value  decreased from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, 
driven by a decrease in CIB due  to sales outpacing 
purchases largely offset by an increase in Home Lending as 
originations outpaced warehouse loan sales.  Nonaccrual 
loans at fair value were relatively flat compared to 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2.
At J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, the carrying 
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was $90.0 
billion  and $36.3 billion , respectively. The increase was 
driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition.  
These loans have an interest-only payment period generally 
followed by an adjustable-r ate or fixed-rate fully amortizing 
payment period to maturity and are typically originated as 
higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers . The 
credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the 
performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio and 
there were no charge-offs associated with the First Republic 
acquisition.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $16.9 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, which 
included $2.6 billion associated with the First Republic 
acquisition. The carrying value of home equity lines of 
credit outstanding  included $4.6 billion  of HELOCs that 
have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments 
or have been modified and $4.7 billion  of interest-only 
balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The 
Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving 
period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure 
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related 
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

At J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, $229.8 billion , or 70%  of the total 
retained residential real estate loan portfolio, was 
concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and 
Massachusetts, compared with $147.8 billion , or 62%  at 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. 
Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic 
composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s 
residential real estate loans.
Modified residential real estate loans
For the three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, 
residential real estate FDMs were $35 million  and $75 
million , respectively.  In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had 
$33 million  and $48 million  of loans subject to trial 
modification where the terms of the loans have not been 
permanently modified, as well as $3 million  and $5 million  
of loans subject to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
proceedings ("Chapter 7 loans") for the three and six 
months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, respectively. The changes to 
the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR 
reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. 
Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were 
considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 
12 for further information.
For the three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, 
residential real estate TDRs were $115 million  and $233 
million , respectively. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information on TDRs in prior periods.
67
Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value consists of prime-quality scored 
auto and business banking loans, other consumer 
unsecured loans, and overdrafts . The portfolio increased 
when compared to D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2 due to originations 
of scored Auto loans and an i ncrease in other consumer 
unsecured fair value option loans associated with the First 
Republic acquisition, largely offset by paydown s. Net 
charge-offs increased for the three and six months ended  
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 compared to the same periods in the prior 
year due to higher scored Auto charge-offs as d elinquency 
levels normalized  and vehicle valuations declined. The 
scored Auto net charge-off rates were 0.41%  and 0.12%  
for the three months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 2022 , 
respectively, and 0.43%  and 0.15%  for the six months 
ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 2022 , respectively.

Credit card
Tota l credit card loans increased from D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2 
reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving 
balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic 
levels.  The J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 30+ and 90+ day delinquency 
rates of 1.70%  and 0.84% , respectively, increased 
compared to the D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2 30+ and 90+ day 
delinquency rates of 1.45%  and 0.68%  respectively, and 
net charge-offs increas ed for the three and six months 
ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 compared to the same periods in the 
prior year as 30+ day delinquencies have normalized. 
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.
Modifications of credit card loans
For the three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, credit 
card FDMs were  $181 million  and $326 million , 
respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had  $26 
million  of loans subject to trial modification where the 
terms of the loans have not been permanently modified for 
both the three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3. The 
changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR 
reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. 
Accordingly, trial modifications were considered TDRs, but 
not FDMs.
For the three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, credit 
card TDRs were $81 million  and $163 million , respectively. 
Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash m anagement and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 72-75  for further information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM 
and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the 
wholesale methodology is applied when determining the 
allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert 
certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and 
services, associated with the First Republic acquisition to 
align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. 
Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk 
rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in 
future periods.  Refer to Business Develop ments on page 9 
for additional information.
As of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the increase in nonperforming 
exposure was driven by loans, resulting from client-specific 
downgrades in CB and AWM, partially offset by a reduction 
in lending-related commitments. For the six months ended 
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, wholesale charge-offs remained low, 
despite an increase in charge-offs in the second quarter of 
2023 concentrated in Office real estate.
As of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, retained loans increased $64.5 billion  
predominantly driven by the impact of the First Republic 
acquisition. Lending-related commitments increased $69.1 
billion  driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, 
and net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an 
increase in held-for-sale positions in th e bridge financ ing 
portfolio .Wholesale credit portfolio

Wholesale  credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries 
with actual or potential credit concerns.
Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the 
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, was $35.0 billion  and $31.3 billion  as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, representing approximately 2.8%  
and 2.7%  of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively . Criticized exposure increased, driven by client-specific downgrades 
largely in Real Estate, Consumer and Retail, Technology, Media & Telecommunications, and Healthcare, as well as exposures 
associated with the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by client-specific upgrades. Of  the $35.0 billion  of criticized 
exposure at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, approximately half was undrawn and $31.8 billion  was performing.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. The industry of 
risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 24 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of 
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is 
generally held against these receivables. To manage its 
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and 
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, 
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other 
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and 
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives 
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to 
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions 
from its market-making activities, including the 
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. 
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its 
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature 
of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the 
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is 
exposed. For over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives the Firm 
is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. 
For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures 
and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) 
derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk 
of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”). 
Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk 
exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use 
of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and 
collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative 
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding 
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically 
covered by collateral agreements due to their short 
maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily 
— was approximately 88%  and 87%  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements and for a further discussion of derivative 
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets was $64.2 billion  and $70.9 
billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, 
respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by market 
movements in CIB Markets. Derivative receivables represent 
the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect 
to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the 
related cash collateral held by the Firm. 
In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that may be used as security when the fair value 
of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these 
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent 
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in 
the LCR rule. 
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other 
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not 
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The 
benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each 
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master 
netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the 
derivative receivables for each counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative 
contracts move in the Firm’s favor.  Refer to Note 5 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements for derivatives transactions.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains 
credit protection against certain loans in the retained 
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related 
notes. Information on credit portfolio management 
activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial asset s 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses generally consists of :
•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),
•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets, and
•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is reflected in investment securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 was  
$24.3 billion , reflecting a net addition of $2.7 billion  from 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. 
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included  
$1.5 billion , consisting of:
•$819 million  in wholesale , predominantly driven by 
net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions 
related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter 
of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed 
on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, 
and
•$649 million  in consumer , predominantly driven by 
Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of 
changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, 
including the impact from the weighted average U.S. 
unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 
2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset 
by reduced borrower uncertainty. 
The net addition also included  $1.2 billion  to establish the 
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.
The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on 
the relative adverse scenario in the first quarter of 2023, 
reflecting an increased probability of a moderate recession 
due to tightening financial conditions.
The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of 
$587 million  as a result of the adoption of changes to the 
TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 
1 for further information.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.5% 
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024.The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:  
Assumptions at June 30, 2023
4Q23 2Q24 4Q24
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.2 %  4.9 %  5.0 %
YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 0.5 %  — %  1.0 %
Assumptions at December 31, 2022
2Q23 4Q23 2Q24
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 3.8 %  4.3 %  5.0 %
YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.5 %  0.4 %  — %
(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
(b)The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of 
the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real 
GDP levels from the prior year. 
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates 
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future 
periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists 
of high-quality securities. At J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Treasury 
and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the 
allowance for credit losses, was $610.2 billion , and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio w as AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available, and where not  available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 45-46  and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61  for 
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market 
Risk Management on pages 84-89  for further information 
on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial 
instruments representing ownership interests or other 
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments 
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to 
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and 
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance 
sheets.  These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy.  The 
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and 
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial 
results.  The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in 
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to 
support underserved communities and minority-owned 
businesses.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term.  Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 131-138  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities 
that give rise to market risk. 
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 148  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 
10-K.
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time.  Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”),  a statistical 
risk measure , to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment.  The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR .  
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a  
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events.  The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.
Refer to page 133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K 
for further information regarding VaR, including the 
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website,  for 
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 136-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

(a)Divers ification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 
of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as 
the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.
(b)Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions 
revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's 
internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening 
of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now 
reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.
(c)Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.
(d)The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans, MSR, and related hedges.
(e)For the period ended June 30, 2022, maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated due to the effects of nickel price increases and the associated 
volatility in the nickel market which occurred during the first quarter of 2022 .
Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR was flat for the three months ended 
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, when compared with March 31, 2023 , 
reflecting increases in fixed income offset by market volatility 
relating to commodities rolling out of the one-year historical 
look-back period. Year over year results
Average total VaR decreased by $7 million  for the three 
months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, compared with the same

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily  VaR model backtesting , which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses  depicted in the chart below do not reflect  the 
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution 
of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other 
valuation adjustments and net interest income.  These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the 
backtesting gain or loss on a particular day.  The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily  Risk Management VaR for the prior day.  
Under the Firm’s  Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the 
historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to  incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100  
trading days on average . The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number 
of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility 
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 134 of the 259 days , and observed 15 VaR 
backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 34 of the 65 days, 
and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions.
The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for  the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk 
Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals.  
Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent.  The results in the chart 
below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s  Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Structural interest rate risk management
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, 
issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio.
One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate 
risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates 
the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 
132 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and 
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many 
different factors, including:
•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding 
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the 
Firm or its clients and customers in response to 
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience. 
Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's 
earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain 
assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative 
Easing that are highly uncertain and require management 
judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held 
by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by 
actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary 
policy, including through the use of the Reverse 
Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors 
that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition 
for deposits.
•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 
betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and 
periodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk 
calculations, the Firm updated its model in the second 
quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags 
impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits . The 
model change incorporated observed pricing and 
customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate 
environments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from 
the modeled assumptions, primari ly due to customer 
behavior and competition for deposits .
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income. 
Refer to Outlook on page 8  for additional information.
The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table 
below.

(a)Reflects the impact of the aforementioned model update to 
incorporate deposit repricing lags. Prior periods have not been 
revised.
In the absence of th e model update to incorporate deposit 
repricing lags in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S. 
dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2023, would have been 
lower by $4.2 billion  to the +100 basis points shift in short-
term and parallel rate scenarios and higher by $4.4 billion 
to the -100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate 
scenarios .
In addition, the change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities 
as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 compared to D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2  
reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet 
including the impact of the First Republic acquisition.
As of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm’s sensitivity to the +/-100 
basis points parallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a 
greater impact from assets repricing compared to the 
impact of liabilities repricing.
87
The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to 
integrate products associated with the First Republic 
acquisition to align with the Firm’s business and operations. 
The Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments 
certain products associated with the First Republic 
acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated. 
Accordingly, earnings-at-risk results may be impacted in 
future periods.
The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the 
table below.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario 
involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates 
increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term 
rates staying at current levels were not material to the 
Firm’s earnings-at-risk at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  
2022 .
In addition to earnings-at-risk, the Firm also measures 
Economic Value Sensitivity (EVS). EVS stress tests the 
longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the 
sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily 
retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as 
well as related hedges, under various interest rate 
scenarios. In accordance with the CTC structural interest 
rate risk policy, the Firm has established limits on  EVS as a 
percentage of  TCE.

JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional 
information.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the 
potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant 
market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2022  Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, as the movement in market 
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these 
sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.
Refer to pages 139-140  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.
Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and their 
comparative exposures as of D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows.
The increases in exposures to Germany and the United 
Kingdom were primarily driven by incre ases in  cash placed 
with the central banks of those countries, due to client-
driven activities, including as a result of changes in interest 
rates.  
The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by a 
reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia 
due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in 
interest rates.
The Firm continues to monitor potential impacts to the Firm 
associated with the war in Ukraine. As of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, 
exposure to Russia was approximately  $430  million . This 
amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of 
clients  at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.Top 20 country exposures (excluding the U.S.)(a)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorgan Chase ’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses generally consists of:
•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated).
•The allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets, and
•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is reflected in investment securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2022 Form 10-K for further information on these 
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies 
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; 
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 80-82  and 
Note 13 of this Form 10-Q for further information.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are 
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest 
effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by 
portfolio and geography.
•Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. 
unemployment and HPI.
•Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. 
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. 
interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, 
commercial real estate prices and HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.
As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm 
recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans 
acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of 
May 1, 2023 . Given the differences in risk rating 
methodologies for the First Republic Portfolio, and the 
ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance 
for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was 
measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm 
with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled 
estimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is 
excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis  
below. The allowance for credit losses for  predominantly all 
of the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm’s 
modeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is 
predominantly residential real estate that has more 
commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to 
value ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in 
the sensitivity analysis  below. Refer to Note 28 for 
additional information on the First Republic acquisition. 
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.
For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 80 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
91
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment 
rate, averaging approximately 1.6% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
2.2% in the first quarter of 2024; lower
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining 
approximately 3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter 
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.4% in 
the third quarter of 2024; and lower national HPI with a 
peak difference of approximately 10.5% in the first quarter 
of 2025.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:
•The allowance as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, reflects credit losses 
beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to 
the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.
•The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables. 
•Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition 
and borrower behavior can significantly affect the 
allowance for credit losses.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm 
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse 
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering 
offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative 
components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the 
comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures 
below reflect the following differences:
•An increase of approximately  $750 million  for residential 
real estate loans and lending-related commitments , 
including the First Republic portfolios
•An increase of approximately $2.4 billion  for credit card 
loans
▪An increase of approximately  $3.8 billion  for wholesale 
loans and lending-related commitments, excluding the 
First Republic portfolios. 
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3.Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.
Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 
therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more 
significant than those required when estimating the fair 
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed s, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.Credit card rewards liability 
The credit card rewards liability was  $12.2 billion  and 
$11.3 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase 
in the liability was predominantly driven by continued 
growth in rewards points ear ned on higher  spend and 
promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 
2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain 
reward program terms in the second quarter . Refer to 
pages 151-152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, 
associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.
Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2022  Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with 
the accounting for income taxes.
Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on 
page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
Note  1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase  & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a 
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law 
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the 
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in 
investment banking, financial services for consumers and 
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction 
processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, 
JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed 
certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic 
acquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain 
operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, 
associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with 
the Firm’s businesses and operations. The Firm also 
continues to evaluate to which segments certain clients, 
products and services a ssociated with the First Republic 
acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated. 
Accordingly, reporting classifications and allocations may 
change in future periods including across the Firm's 
segments. Refer to Note 27 for a further discussion of the 
Firm’s business segments and Note 28 for additional 
information on the First Republic acquisition. 
The accounting and financial reporting policies of  JPMorgan 
Chase  and its subsidiaries conform to  U.S. GAAP. 
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the 
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by 
regulatory authorities.  
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared 
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the 
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual 
results could be different from these estimates. In the 
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments 
have been included such that this interim financial 
information is fairly stated.
These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should 
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated 
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in  
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2022  Form 10-K.
Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been 
revised to conform with the current presentation.  
Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts 
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which  the Firm has 
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany 
balances and transactions  have been eliminated.Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by  
the Firm are not assets of  JPMorgan Chase and are not 
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial 
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is 
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.  
Refer to Notes  1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 
10-K for a further description of  JPMorgan Chase’s 
accounting policies regarding consolidation.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables 
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the 
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net 
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP 
also permits securities financing  balances to be presented 
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including 
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting 
agreement.  The Firm has elected to net such balances 
where it has determined that the specified conditions are 
met. Refer to Note  1 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2022  Form 10-K  
for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.  
Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023
Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio 
Layer Method
The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge 
a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the 
portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be 
included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size of 
the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This 
guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that can be 
used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and 
disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting 
adjustments. As permitted by the guidance,  the Firm 
elected to transfer  HTM securities to  AFS and designate 
those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon 
adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained 
earnings was not material.
Refer to Note  5 and Note  10 for additional information.
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt 
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures
The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting 
and disclosure requirements for  TDRs , including the 
requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted 
cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a 
non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to 
troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for 
these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-
101
modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-
modification effective interest rate.
The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based 
allowance approach for modified loans to troubled 
borrowers for all portfolios except modified nonaccrual 
risk-rated loans which the  Firm elected to continue applying 
a DCF methodology. Refer to Note  13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2022  Form 10-K for a description of the portfolio-based 
allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance 
approach.
This guidance was adopted under the modified 
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to 
the allowance for credit losses of  $ 5 8 7  m i l l i o n and an 
increase to retained earnings of  $ 4 4 6  m i l l i o n, after-tax , 
predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit 
card.
The adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure 
requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess 
whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan 
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 
consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, 
other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a 
combination of these modifications.  The Firm has defined 
these types of modifications as financial difficulty 
modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the 
requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably 
expected or involves a concession, the population of loans 
considered FDMs will differ from those previously 
considered TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of 
current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination 
year. 
Refer to Note  12 for further information.

related.
(b)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. 
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not 
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities 
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further 
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have 
been included in each period presented.

(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). 
(d)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be 
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, 
private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $956 million  and $950 million , respectively. Included in these balances at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, were trading assets of $40 million  and $43 million , respectively, and other assets of $916 million  and $907 million , respectively.
(e)At J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, included $9.3 billion  and $9.7 billion , respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, a nd $6.8 billion  of 
commercial first-lien mortgages for both periods. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. 
GSEs and government agencies of $3.3 billion  and $2.4 billion , respectively.
(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid 
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit 
associated with cash collatera l.
Level 3 valuations 
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for 
further information on the  Firm’s valuation process and a 
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for 
individual financial instruments.  
The following table presents the  Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the 
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for 
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of 
such inputs.  While the determination to classify an 
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the 
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, 
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable 
components (that is, components that are actively quoted 
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the 
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs 
are not included in the table. In addition, the  Firm manages 
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial 
instruments using securities and derivative positions that 
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The range of values presented in the table is representative 
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the 
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted 
averages of the input values presented in the table are 
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that 
the input is being used to value.  
In the  Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic 
average values do not reflect the degree of input 
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the  
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the 
characteristics of the various instruments held by  the Firm 
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range 
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation 
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied 
volatility levels because the option contracts have different 
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and 
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the 
characteristics of the instruments held by the  Firm at each 
balance sheet date.

(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued 
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b)Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $706 million , nonagency securities of $5 million  and non-trading loans of $930 million .
(c)Comprises nonagency securities of $6 million , trading loans of $72 million  and non-trading loans of $2.2 billion .
(d)Comprises trading loans of  $1.0  billio n and non-trading loans of $638  million.
(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain 
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The 
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f)Includes equity securities of $843 million  including $213 million  in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is 
generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant 
both individually and in aggregate.
(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-
based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100 .
(h)Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i)Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.
107
Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note  2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K f or a 
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in 
unobservable inputs and the relationships between 
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of 
the underlying instruments and external market factors that 
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the  Firm’s 
positions.  
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the 
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in 
fair value) for financial instruments classified by  the Firm 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the  three 
months  ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 2022 . When a 
determination is made to classify a financial instrument 
within level 3, the determination is based on the 
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair 
value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments 
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 
components, observable components (that is, components 
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external 
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table 
below include changes in fair value due in part to 
observable factors that are part of the valuation 
methodology. Also,  the Firm risk-manages the observable 
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities 
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 
risk management instruments are not included below, the 
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the 
effect of  the Firm’s risk management activities related to 
such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis 
Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets 
since  December 31, 2022, for those items measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on  page 115 
for further information on changes impacting items measured 
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  
Three and six months ended June 30, 2023  
Level 3 assets were $26.8 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, reflecting 
an increase of $3.0 billion  from March 31, 2023, and an 
increase of $3.2 billion  from December 31, 2022.
The increase for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2023 was predominantly driven by:
•$2.3 billion  and $ 2 . 4  b i l l i o n, respectively, in non-trading 
loans pr imarily due to $ 1 . 9  b i l l i o n of loans in CIB  
associated with the First Republic acquisition.
Refer to the sections below for additional information.
Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair 
value on a recurring basis 
For the three months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, significant 
transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:
•$ 1 . 2  b i l l i o n of gross interest rate derivative payables as a 
result of transition to term SOFR for certain interest rate 
options.
•$ 7 6 0  m i l l i o n of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in 
observability.
For the three months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, there were no

result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the 
significance of unobservable inputs.
•$ 9 1 7  m i l l i o n of non-trading loans driven  by a decrease in 
observability.
For the six months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, significant transfers 
from level 3 into level 2 included the following:
•$ 1 . 3  b i l l i o n and $ 8 2 7  m i l l i o n of gross equity derivative 
receivables and gross equity derivative payables, 
respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and

a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in 
the significance of unobservable inputs.
For the six months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, significant transfers 
from level 2 into level 3 included the following:
•$ 1 . 6  b i l l i o n of total debt and equity instruments, largely 
due to equity securities of $ 9 5 9  m i l l i o n driven by a 
decrease in observability predominantly as a result of 
restricted access to certain markets.
•$ 1 . 3  b i l l i o n of gross equity derivative payables as a result 
of a decrease in observability and an increase in the 
significance of unobservable inputs.
For the six months ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, significant transfers 
from level 3 into level 2 included the following:
•$ 9 6 5  m i l l i o n of gross interest rate derivative receivables as 
a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in 
the significance of unobservable inputs.
•$ 9 2 0  m i l l i o n and $ 1 . 4  b i l l i o n of gross equity derivative 
receivables and gross equity derivative payables, 
respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and 
a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs.
All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or 
significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur 
at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which 
they occur.

nonrecurring basis as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, $220 million  related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities 
are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.
(b)Of the $840 million  in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, $23 million  related to residential real estate 
loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are 
valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with 
actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 3% to 56%  with a weighted average of 25% .

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or 
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), 
with such changes recognized in other income.  
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes,  the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed 
necessary to arrive at  the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different 
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with  the Firm’s valuation techniques for 
private equity direct investments.  
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of  June 30, 
2023 and 2022 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the 
periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair 
value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is  the Firm’s interest in approximately  37 million  Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”). 
These shares are subject to certain transfer r estrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) 
at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. On  June 29, 2023, Visa filed a 
Current Report on Form  8-K with the SEC indi cating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from  
1.5991  to 1.5902  effective  June 28, 2023. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments 
related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters 
may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, there is significant uncertainty regarding 
when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will 
be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to 
Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.
In connection with prior sales of Visa B shares,  the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the 
shares under which  the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative 
instruments,  the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make 
periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue 
as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value 
using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon  the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of 
the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in 
other income. As of  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with  2 3  m i l l i o n Visa B shares that  the Firm 
had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, 
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and 
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying 
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected 
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including 
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. 
(b)Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money Note in level 3 of Long-term debt associated

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,  the Firm 
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without 
notice. Refer to  page 169  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K  for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related 
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm 
commitments, and written loan commitments.  
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement 
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that 
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted 
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.  
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:  
•Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed 
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments  
•Certain securities financing agreements  
•Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise 
be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument  
•Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded 
derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities  
•Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by  CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are 
carried at fair value  
Changes in fair value under  the fair value option election  
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the  three and six 
months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 2022 , for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information 
presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk 
management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(c)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected 
structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for 
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors 
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if 
applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value 
option was elected was  $10.2 billion  and $7.6 billion , respectively,  with a corresponding fair value of  $264 million  and $24 
million , respectively. Refer to Note  28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K, and Note  24 of this Form 10-Q for further

Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, 
counterparties or customers are engaged in similar 
business activities or activities in the same geographic 
region, or when they have similar economic features that 
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to 
be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.
JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its 
credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk 
concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when 
deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s 
agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in 
the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are 
adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite.
In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are 
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic 
region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the 
portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations 
can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies 
and portfolio guidelines.  Refer to Note 12 for additional 
information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s 
consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit 
risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and 
monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level 
and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan 
syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, 
credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral 
and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information on loans. 
The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any 
particular loan product or industry segment results in a 
significant concentration of credit risk. 
Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included 
in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and 
establishing its allowance for loan losses.

The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by  the Firm’s 
three credit portfolio segments as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. The wholesale industry of risk category is 
generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin 
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce 
positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 5 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients 
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk 
exposures. Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the  Firm’s use of and 
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.  
The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting 
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited 
number of  the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the 
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net 
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge 
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are 
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and 
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as 
derivatives used in  the Firm’s market-making businesses or 
for other purposes.
The following table outlines  the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure 
category.

information on volumes and types of credit derivative contracts.
(b)Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional 
derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an 
indication of the volume of  the Firm’s derivatives activity, 
the notional amounts significantly exceed, in  the Firm’s 
view, the possible losses that could arise from such 
transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional 
amount is not exchanged; it is simply a reference amount 
used to calculate payments.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by 
contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, 
have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where  the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the 
master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on 
the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.  
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables,  
the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit 
risk associated with  the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

“Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount . For the 
purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined 
in the LCR rule;
•the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date 
presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and  
•collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features  
Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related 
contingent features related to the  Firm’s derivative contracts.  
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that 
contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated 
collateral  the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of  JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries , predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, 
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered 
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be 
triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a 
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in 
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), 
nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the 
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset  
In certain instances  the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure 
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The 
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note  11, but in limited 
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers 
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material  at both J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2.

securities. Gai ns and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b)Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item.  Excludes the accrual 
of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses 
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were 
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net 
realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. 
(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward 
points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis sprea ds. Excluded components may impact earnings either through 
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-
currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a)Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $12.8 billion  and $26.0 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively, to which 
the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus 
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income 
in future periods.
(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not 
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is 
$20.9 billion  and $20.3 billion , respectively, and for long-term debt is $216 million  and $221 million , respectively.
(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method 
hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedge d. At J u n e  3 0 ,  
2023 , the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $67.8 billion , of whic h $49.6 billion  was  designated as hedged. The 
cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $(1.1) billion , reflecting $(865) million  and $(229) million  for active and discontinued hedging relationships, 
respectively. Refer to Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information.
(d)Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in 
future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net 
interest income in future periods.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the  three and six months ended  June 30, 2023 
and 2022 .
Over the next 12 months,  the Firm expects that approximately  $(1.3) billion  (after-tax) of net losses  recorded in AOCI at  
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the 
maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately  
seven years , corresp onding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.  For open cash flow hedges, the 
maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately  seven years . The Firm’s longer-dated 
forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note  5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables 
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the  Firm sold and purchased as of  
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure 
of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the 
occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, 
each of which reduces, in  the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

Note 10 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are 
classified as  AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading 
assets are discussed in Note  2. Predominantly all of the  Firm’s 
AFS and HTM securities are held  by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with its asset-liability management activities.  At 
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the investment securities portfolio consisted 
of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based 
upon external ratings where available, and where not 
available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).  
Effective January 1, 2023,  the Firm adopted the portfolio 
layer method hedge accounting guidance which permitted a 
transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption.  The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a 
carrying value of  $ 7 . 1  b i l l i o n resulting in the recognition of  
$ 3 8  m i l l i o n net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. This 
transfer was a noncash transaction. Refer to Note  1 and Note  
21 for additional information.
During 2022,  the Firm transferred  $ 7 8 . 3  b i l l i o n of 
investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital 
management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized 
losses of  $ 4 . 8  b i l l i o n on the securities at the date of transfer.

(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. 
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, 
including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; 
and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for 
certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b)For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $ ( 3 0 )  m i l l i o n and the portfolio 
layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $(865) million  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance 
for credit losses of $ ( 7 4 )  m i l l i o n at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3.
(c)Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years  or more, based on contractual maturity. The 
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years  for agency residential MBS, seven years  for 
agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and six years  for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.
(d)Includes  AFS securities associated with the First Republic acquisition , primarily impacting due after 10 years. Refer to Note 28 for add itional information.

Note 11 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note  11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K  for 
a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities 
financing activities. Refer to Note  3 for further information 
regarding securities financing agreements for which the fair 
value option has been elected. Refer to Note  25 for further 
information regarding assets pledged and collateral 
received in securities financing agreements.
The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of  
the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of  J u n e  3 0 ,  
2023  and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. When  the Firm has obtained 
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master 
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met,  the Firm 
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances 
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with 
the same counterparty. In addition,  the Firm exchanges 
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to 
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but 
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where  the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty 
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with 
securities financing balances that do not meet all these 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in 
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the 
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net 
amounts” presented.  Where a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances 
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In 
transactions where  the Firm is acting as the lender in a 
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives 
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral,  the Firm 
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other 
assets and the obligation to return those securities within 
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At both J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, the Firm held $692 million  of financial assets for which the rights have been 
transferred to third parties; however, the  transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have 
been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transfer red assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and 
the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan.  The Firm accounts for loans based on the following 
categories:
•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
•Loans held-for-sale
•Loans at fair value
Refer to Note  12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer 
to Note  3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on  the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. 
Refer to Note  2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.  
On January 1, 2023  the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage 
Disclosures accounting guidance as discussed in Note  1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and 
disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure requirements for FDMs. The disclosure requirements 
for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after  January 1, 2023. Refer to Note  12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 
10-K for a detailed discussion on loan modifications prior to  January 1, 2023 , which were accounted for and reported as TDRs. 
This new guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for periods 
beginning on or after  January 1, 2023.
Loan portfolio 
The Firm’s loan portfolio , including loans of $ 1 4 9 . 8  b i l l i o n associated with the First Republic acquisition, is divided into three  
portfolio segments , which are the same segments used by the  Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, 
excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the  Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk 
in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.  
Consumer, excluding 
credit cardCredit card Wholesale(c)(d)
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)• Credit card loans • Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)
(a)Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB .
(b)Includes scored auto , business banking loans and overdrafts in BWM and other consumer unsecured loans in CIB.
(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is 
applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d)The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, 
purpose, and type of borrower.
(e)Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to 
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB). Refer to Note

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist 
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity 
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, 
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. 
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by 
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only 
payment period and certain payment-option loans that may

Approximatel y 37%  of th e total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien 
position the  Firm holds is considered in the  Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to 
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the 
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available 
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm 
reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed 
by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, approximately 
9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days  or more past due.

(c)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered 
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of 
the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(d)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $44 million  and $45 million  and $89 million  and $90 million  for the three and six

available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(g)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.

Loan modifications
The Firm grants certain modifications of residential real 
estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, 
which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs.  The 
Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as 
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that 
generally provide variou s modifications to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited 
to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-
insignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness that 
would otherwise have been required under the terms of the 
original agreement, are considered FDMs.  
For the  three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, 
residential real estate FDMs were  $35 million  and $75 
million , respectively. The financial effects of the FDMs, 
which were largely in the form of term extensions and 
interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-
average life of the loans by  15 years  and 18 years , and 
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate 
from  6.90%  to 4.21%  and 6.75%  to 4.01%  for the three 
and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.  There 
were  no additional commitments  to lend to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been 
modified as FDMs. In addition to FDMs,  the Firm also had  
$ 3 3  m i l l i o n and $ 4 8  m i l l i o n of loans subject to a trial 
modification , and $ 3  m i l l i o n and $ 5  m i l l i o n of Chapter 7 
loans for the  three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, 
respectively. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance 
eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession 
assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and 
Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs.  
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications 
of residential real estate loans where  the Firm granted 
concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial 
difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as 
TDRs.  For the three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 2, 
new TDRs were  $ 1 1 5  m i l l i o n and $ 2 3 3  m i l l i o n, 
respectively. There were  no additional commitments to lend 
to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been 
modified in TDRs. Refer to Note  12 of JPMorgan Chase's 
2022 Form 10-K for further information on TDRs.  Nature and extent of modifications

(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In 
accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that 
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the 
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral 
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves 
subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

Loan modifications
The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January 
1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for  60 
months , and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card under long-term programs. If the cardholder does not 
comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in 
accordance with  the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases,  the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.
The following table s provide information on credit card loan modifications considered FDMs.

For both the three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm also had  $26 million  of loans subject to trial modifications. 
The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. 
Accordingly, trial modifications are not considered FDMs.

For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is 
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses  two 
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit 
card loans remain in the modification program and continue 
to be charged off in accordance with  the Firm's standard 
charge-off policy.
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications 
of credit card loans where  the Firm granted concessions to 
borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were 
generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Refer to Note  
12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further 
information on TDRs.  Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

For the three and six months ended  June 30, 2023 , Secured 
by real estate FDMs were $ 7 7  m i l l i o n and $ 8 5  m i l l i o n 
respectively. The financial effects of FDMs were largely term 
extensions which extended the loans by a weighted-average 
of nine months . There were no re-defaults during the three 
months ended June 30, 2023  and $ 1  m i l l i o n in modified 
term extensions that re-defaulted during the six months 
ended June 30, 2023. There were no additional 
commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs for the  
three and six months ended  June 30, 2023 .
Prior to January 1, 2023, c ertain loan modifications were 
considered TDRs.  
For the  three and six months ended  June 30, 2022, new 
TDRs were  $60 million  and $479 million , respectively. New 
TDRs for the  three and six months ended June 30, 2022 
reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers 
primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. For the  
three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the impact of 
these modifications were not material to  the Firm . 
As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess 
whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is 
greater than those previously considered TDRs.

Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represe nts 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the  Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments.
On January 1, 2023  the Firm adopted the Financial 
Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings 
accounting guidance as described in Note  1.
The adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement 
to measure the allowance for TDRs using a DCF 
methodology and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-
based approach for modified loans to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF methodology is 
still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must 
be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of 
the pre-modification effective interest rate.  
The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance 
approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance 
approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all 
portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual 
risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance 
approach will continue to apply.
This guidance was adopted under the modified 
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to 
the allowance for credit losses of  $ 5 8 7  m i l l i o n and an 
increase to retained earnings of  $ 4 4 6  m i l l i o n, after-tax 
predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit 
card.
Refer to Note  13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022  Form 10-K  for 
a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and 
the related accounting policies.

163
Discussion of changes in the allowance  
The allowance for credit losses as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 was  
$24.3 billion , reflecting a net additio n of $2.7 billion  from 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. 
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included  
$1.5 billion , consisting of:
•$819 million  in wholesale , predominantly driven by 
net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions 
related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter 
of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed 
on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, 
and
•$649 million  in consumer , predominantly driven by 
Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of 
changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, 
including the impact from the weighted average U.S. 
unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 
2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset 
by reduced borrower uncertainty. 
The net addition  also included  $1.2 billion  to establish the 
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending -related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.
The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on 
the relative adverse scenario in the first quarter of 2023, 
reflecting an increased probability of a moderate recession 
due to tightening financial conditions.
The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of 
$587 million  as a result of the adoption of changes to the 
TDR accounting guidance  on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 
1 for further information.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at  5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.5% 
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024.The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:  
Assumptions at June 30, 2023
4Q23 2Q24 4Q24
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.2 %  4.9 %  5.0 %

(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
(b)The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of 
the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real 
GDP levels from the prior year. 
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates 
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future 
periods.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal 
amount of assets held in  Firm-sponsored private-label 
securitization entities, including those in which  the Firm has 
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by  
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the 
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests 
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, 
and derivative contracts. In certain instances,  the Firm’s 
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The  
Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and 
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

In the normal course of business,  JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.  The Firm held 
$12.4 billion  and $13.8 billion  of the commercial paper 
issued by  the Firm -administered multi-seller conduits at  
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively,  
which have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Firm’s 
investments reflect  the Firm’s funding needs and capacity 
and were not driven by market illiquidity.  Other than the 
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules,  the Firm is not obligated under any 
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and 
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been 
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related 
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were  
$11.3 billion  and $10.6 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively,  and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other 
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note  24 
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments.  
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are 
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB 
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party.  
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB 
transactions.

third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, 
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of 
JPMorgan Chase . Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $1.1 billion  and $2.1 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively. 
(f)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by 
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a 
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider , investor , 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee 
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the 
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying assets. Where  the Firm does not 
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a 
variable interest that could potentially be significant,  the 
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance 
sheets in the same manner it would record and report 
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.  
Tax credit vehicles 
The Firm  holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit 
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities 
that own and operate affordable housing , energy, and other  
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A 
third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the 
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly  the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles.  The Firm generally invests in 
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return 
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the 
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by 
equity investments and funding commitments, was  $32.4 
billion  and $30.2 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, of which  $12.6 billion  and $10.6 
billion  was unfunded at  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  
2022 , respectively.  The Firm assesses each project and to 
reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its 
capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. 
Refer to Note  25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for 
further information on affordable housing tax credits  and 
Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments.  
168
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB 
trusts, including  remarketing agent, liquidity or tender 
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,  the 
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a 
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.  
In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,  
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders 
for any shortfall.  The Firm does not have any intent to 
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the 
underlying municipal bonds.  The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since  the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.  
The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to 
customer TOB trusts at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  
2022  was $5.9 billion  and $5.8 billion , respectively.  The 
fair value of assets held by such VIEs at  both J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 
and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2 was $8.2 billion . 
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, 
commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.
Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to  the Firm’s securitization activities for the  three and six months ended  
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 2022 , related to assets held in Firm -sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by  the 
Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored 
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to 
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization 
activity tables above,  the Firm, in the normal course of 
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans 
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, 
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs 
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the 
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans).  The Firm also sells loans 
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae 
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed 
by another U.S. government agency.  The Firm does not 
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these 
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a 
limited number of loan sales,  the Firm is obligated to share 
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note  24 of this Form 10-Q for 
additional information about  the Firm’s loan sales- and 
securitization-related indemnifications and Note  15 for 
additional information about the impact of  the Firm ’s sale

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to  the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain 
loans due to material breaches of representations and 
warranties as discussed in Note  24, the Firm also has the 
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for 
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements . The Firm typically 
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan 
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the 
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable 
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or 
guaranteed. When  the Firm’s  repurchase option becomes 
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding 
liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.  
The following table presents loans  the Firm repurchased or 
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and 
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage 
loans recognized on  the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets 
as of  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. Substantially

months ended June 30, 2022, represents estimated goodwill 
associated with the acquisitions of Frosch Travel Group, LLC in CCB and 
Volkswagen Payments S.A. in CIB. 
(b)Predominantly foreign currency adjustments.Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter 
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or 
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business 
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.  Refer to 
Note  15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of  the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases 
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as 
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse 
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the 
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated 
fair values of the  Firm’s reporting units to decline in the 
future, which could result in a material impairment charge 
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill.  
As of  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, the Firm reviewed current economic 
conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as 
actual business results and projections of business 
performance . Based on such reviews, the Firm has 
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of J u n e  3 0 ,  
2023 , or D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, nor was goodwill written off 
due to impairment during the six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  
2023  or 2022 .
171
Mortgage servicing right s
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value 
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally 
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing 
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage 
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Note s 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2022  Form 10-K  for a further description of the 
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.  
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the  three and six months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 2022 .

advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right 
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if 
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements .

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions 
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the 
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change 
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be 
linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a 
particular assumption may have on the fair value is 
calculated without changing any other assumption. In 
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in 
another, which would either magnify or counteract the 
impact of the initial change.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions 
used to determine the fair value of  the Firm’s MSRs at  
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, and outlines

Note 18 – Long-term debt
JPMorgan Chase issues long-term debt denominated in various currencies, predominantly U.S. dollars, with both fixed and 
variable interest rates. Included in senior and subordinated debt below are various equi ty-linked or other indexed instruments, 
which  the Firm has elected to measure at  fair value ; changes  in fair value are recorded in principal transactions revenue in the 
Consolidated statements of income, except for unrealized gains/(losses) due to DVA which are recorded in OCI. The following 
table is a summary of long-term debt carrying values (including unamortized premiums and discounts, issuance costs, valuation 
adjustments and fair value adjustments, where applicable) by remaining contractual maturity as  of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3.

2022 , respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments. 
(c)Included $78.6 billion  and $72.3 billion  of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively. 
(d)Included $11.2 billion  and $10.3 billion  of outstanding zero-coupon notes at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively. The aggregate principal 
amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $45.7 billion  and $45.3 billion , respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual 
principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable.
(e)Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included amounts  accounted for at fair value which 
were not material at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $18.5 
billion  and $10.5 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively. 
(f)The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively, including non-U.S. 
dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if 
applicable. The interest rates shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.
(g)As of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, included  $25.0 billion  of FHLB advances associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Note 28 for additional information.
(h)As of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, long-term debt in the aggregate of $191.7 billion  was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to 
maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.
(i)The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 is $41.9 billion , 
$58.5 billion , $38.0 billion , $29.2 billion  and $75.2 billion , respectively.
175
The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total 
long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at 
fair value were 3.45%  and 3.26%  as of  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively. In order to modify 
exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate 
movements,  JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative 
instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency 
interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt 
issuances. The use of these instruments modifies  the Firm’s 
interest expense on the associated debt. The modified 
weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, 
including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 
5.02%  and 4.89%  as of  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  
2022 , respectively.  
JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term 
debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These 
guarantees rank pari passu  with the Firm’s other unsecured 
and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such 
guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $34.5 
billion  and $28.2 billion  at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 
D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, respectively. 
The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements 
that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities 
or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any 
limitations on future borrowings or require additional 
collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s 
credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

Note 23 – Regulatory capital
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for 
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized requirements, for the 
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes similar 
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s 
principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines 
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to 
maintain minimum ratios  for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, 
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR . Failure to meet 
these minimum requirements  could cause the Federal 
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to 
these capital requirements  established by their respective 
primary regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based  regulatory 
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to 
which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of  
J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2.

CET1 capital reflected the remaining $ 1 . 4  b i l l i o n benefit 
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.
Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm phased 
out 50% of the other CECL capital transition provisions 
which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, 
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.  
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for

Note 24 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and other 
commitments
JPMorgan Chase  provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address 
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The 
contractual amount of these financial instruments 
represents the maximum possible credit risk to  the Firm 
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment 
or the Firm  be required to fulfill its obligation under the 
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most 
of these commitments and guarantees have historically 
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total 
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in  the 
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit 
exposure or funding requirements.  Refer to Note  28 of 
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2022  Form 10-K  for a further discussion 
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the  
Firm’s related accounting policies.  
To provide for expected  credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 
is maintained. Refer to Note  13 for further information 
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments .The following table summarizes the contractual amounts 
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments 
at J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2. The amounts in 
the table below for credit card, home equity and certain 
scored business banking lending-related commitments 
represent the total available credit for these products.  The 
Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all 
available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at 
the same time.  The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card 
and certain scored business banking lines of credit by 
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as 
permitted by law, without notice. In addition,  the Firm 
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is  60 
days  or more past due.  The Firm may reduce or close 
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of 
the underlying property, or when there has been a 
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the 
borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally 
consist of commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support 
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event 
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new 
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing 
organizations.  The Firm also issues commitments under 
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in 
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of 
credit.Standby  letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are 
conditional lending commitments issued by  the Firm to 
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a 
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial 
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, 
trade financings and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial

The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have 
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to 
Note  28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for further 
information on these derivatives.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee,  the Firm is both a purchaser 
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives 
market. Refer to Note  5 for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives.  Merchant charge-backs  
Under the rules of payment networks,  in its role as a 
merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant Services business 
in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed 
processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a 
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the 
cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s 
issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder 
and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the 
Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the 
Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded 
to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by 
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve 
accounts or obtaining other collateral.  In addition, the Firm 
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment 
or performance risk  related to charge-back s. 
186
Loan sales and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with  the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with GSEs  the Firm has made 
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet 
certain requirements, and that may require  the Firm to 
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan 
purchaser if such representations and warranties are 
breached by  the Firm. 
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with 
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the  
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note  26 
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.  
Sponsored member repo program  
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements 
through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed 
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients 
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. 
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full 
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ 
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The  Firm 
minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a 
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities 
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house 
therefore the  Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The  
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into 
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the 
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments 
line on  page 185 . Refer to Note  11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2022  Form 10-K  for additional information on credit risk 
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of 
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.  
Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt 
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan 
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100% -owned 
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and 
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees 
these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu 
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated 
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 185  of 
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 
10-K for additional information.Note 25 – Pledged assets and collateral
Refer to Note  29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K  for 
a discussion of the  Firm’s pledged assets and collateral.  
Pledged assets 
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain 
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with 
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and 
FHLBs. Additionally, the  Firm pledges assets for other 
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other 
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to 
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits . Certain of 
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise 
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically 
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets 
pledged.

Collateral 
The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is 
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This 
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other 
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related 
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative 
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and 
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales 
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 26 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of June 30, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and 
affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal 
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government 
investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The 
litigations range from individual actions involving a single 
plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of 
class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement 
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by 
both governmental agencies and self-regulatory 
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages 
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve 
each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies 
and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort 
and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and 
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel 
legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of 
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately  $ 1 . 3  b i l l i o n at June 30, 2023. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
was based upon information available as of that date for 
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an 
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For 
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an 
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate 
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
involves significant judgment, given:
•the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
•the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability 
(if any) has yet to be determined, 
•the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
•the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of 
such proceedings, including where the Firm has made 
assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or 
other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of 
adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those 
assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be 
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may 
vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal 
proceedings.
1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a 
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia 
by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian 
state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan 
(Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges 
“dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in 
relation to payments of $ 3 0 0  m i l l i o n and $ 5 0 0  m i l l i o n, 
from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB 
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 
1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company 
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. 
In September 2022, the Firm filed an application 
challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s 
jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB 
discontinued its claim against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but 
requested permission of the Court to refile in the future, 
which the Court took under consideration.  
Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in 
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by 
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase 
entities into residential housing projects developed by the 
A m r a p a l i  G r o u p  ( “ A m r a p a l i ” ) .  I n  2 0 1 7 ,  n u m e r o u s  c r e d i t o r s  
filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions 
brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or 
failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ 
petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India 
and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order 
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately 
$31.5 million . The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. 
Relatedly, i n July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued 
an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and 
other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities 
and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, 
violated certain currency control and money laundering 
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry 
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) 
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million  from J.P. 
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the 
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and 
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.   
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.  The Firm 
previously reported settlements with certain government 
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and 
trading activities and controls related to those activities. 
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded 
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The 
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions 
that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on 
the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) 
188
through the ten-year  disqualification period following the 
antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental 
inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter 
which is currently pending before the South Africa 
Competition Tribunal.
With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a 
consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, 
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws 
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign 
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of 
persons who transacted in FX futures and options on 
futures. Although certain members of the settlement class 
filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an 
agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 
2022. The District Court denied certification of a putative 
class action against the Firm and other foreign exchange 
dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign 
currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary 
judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023.  
Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition, 
some FX-related individual and putative class actions based 
on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed 
outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the 
Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve 
one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In 
July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for 
class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement 
in principle has been reached in the putative class action, 
which remains subject to court approval. 
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging 
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, 
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card 
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of 
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases 
for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on 
appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for 
the Eastern District of New York.
The original class action was divided into two separate 
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other 
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the 
parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement 
which amends and supersedes the prior settlement 
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants 
collectively contributed an additional $900 million  to the 
approximately $5.3 billion  previously held in escrow from 
the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended 
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. 
In March 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s approval of the 
settlement, and two merchants have filed petitions for 
rehearing of the Appellate Court’s approval. Based on the 
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended 
class settlement, $700 million  has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with 
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action 
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District 
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in 
part, and denied the motion in part.
Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages 
class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as 
well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of 
those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached 
settlements with the merchants who opted out representing 
approximately 65%  of the combined Mastercard-branded 
and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. 
Jeffrey Epstein Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was 
named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of New York 
alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly 
facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other 
unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein 
until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, 
was a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-
trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was 
filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the 
government of the United States Virgin Islands and also 
alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. In March 
2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s motions to dismiss these 
complaints, allowing some claims to proceed in both 
lawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm’s former 
employee, James Edward Staley, into the two lawsuits, 
asserting claims for indemnification, contribution, breach of 
fiduciary duty and violation of the faithless servant 
doctrine. In May 2023, the Court denied Staley’s motion to 
dismiss the impleader complaints. In June 2023, the Court 
granted the putative class’  motion for class certification and 
granted a preliminary approval of a settlement between the 
class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will pay $ 2 9 0  m i l l i o n to a fund 
for Epstein survivors. The actions involving the government 
of the United States Virgin Islands and Staley are 
proceeding. 
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from 
various governmental agencies and entities around the 
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s 
(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for 
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s 
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss 
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to 
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain 
subject, continues. In December 2016, the European 
Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other 
banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules 
relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that 
decision with the European General Court, and that appeal 
is pending.

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along 
with other banks in various individual and putative class 
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar 
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the 
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has 
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain 
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims 
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the 
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative 
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was 
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been 
dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a 
lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and 
other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement 
to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the 
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In 
September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint 
in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have 
moved to dismiss. The Firm’s settlements of putative class 
actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and 
the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill 
Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in 
November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss 
franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval.
Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, 
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are 
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust 
law and New York State common law in connection with an 
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous 
exchange trading for securities lending transactions. 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. 
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which 
defendants have opposed. The parties have reached an 
agreement in principle to settle this action, subject to final 
documentation and court approval.
Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class 
actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting 
to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the 
Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and 
former officers.  
Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical 
trading practices by former employees in the precious 
metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct 
which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the 
DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary 
activities that were separately the subject of a resolution 
between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in 
November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits 
was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in 
May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust 
enrichment claims relating to the historical trading 
practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In 
December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to 
dismiss this action in full, and in January 2023, the plaintiff 
filed a notice of appeal, which remains pending. A second 
shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of New York in 
December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices 
and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty 
and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is 
excused from making a demand to commence litigation 
because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants 
have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a 
consolidated putative class action is pending in the United 
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on 
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan 
Chase common stock during the putative class period, 
alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially 
false or misleading because they did not disclose certain 
information relating to the historical trading practices and 
conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended 
complaint in this action. 
A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 
2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty 
and violations of federal securities laws based on the 
alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise 
adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records 
preservation requirements which were the subject of 
resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and 
the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the 
amended complaint is pending.
Two shareholder derivative suits were filed in May and June 
2023, respectively, in the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York asserting breaches of 
fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on the alleged 
failure of the Board of Directors and James Dimon to 
exercise adequate oversight with respect to the Firm’s 
provision of banking services to Jeffrey Epstein. These 
actions allege that the shareholders are excused from 
making a demand to commence litigation because such a 
demand would have been futile. These actions were 
consolidated and defendants have moved to dismiss the 
amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. 
*     *     *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as 
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has 
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to 
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may 
be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with 
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm 
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable 
190
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its 
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its 
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $420 million  and 
$73 million  for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 
2022 , respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s 
litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. 
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome 
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek 
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters 
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of 
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot 
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of 
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate 
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or 
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase 
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a 
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial 
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the 
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no 
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently 
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among other 
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level 
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 27 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are 
determined based on the products and services provided, or 
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in 
which financial information is currently evaluated by the 
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented 
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and 
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further 
discussion of JPMorgan Chase ’s business segments.
Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
segment results as of or for the three and six months ended  
June 30, 2023 and 2022 , on a managed basis. The Firm’s 
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. 
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax 
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the 
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the 
Firm’s managed basis. 
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is 
referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, 
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the 
LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated 
its line of business capital allocations to reflect the impact 
of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Line of business 
equity on  page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for 
additional information on capital allocation.

Note 28 – Business combinations 
On M a y  1 ,  2 0 2 3, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets 
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the 
"First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver, fo r $67.9 
billion , resulting in an estimated  bargain purchase gain of 
$2.7 billion  recorded in other income. The estimated 
bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the 
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the 
purchase price. T he First Republic acquisition further 
advances  the Firm's wealth management  strategy and  is 
complementary to  the Firm's existing franchises.
The Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a 
business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the 
initial recognition of the assets acquired  and liabilities 
assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair 
values as of  M a y  1 ,  2 0 2 3. The determination of those fair 
values required management to make certain market-based 
assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount 
rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the 
acquisition.  The Firm believes th at the fair value estimates 
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a 
reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain 
purchase gain.  
The Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the 
settlement process under which the purchase price, and the 
identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
will be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process 
may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase 
gain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into 
with the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a 
year after the acquisition date . 
In addition, t he purchase price and the estimated bargain  
purchase gain could change pending management's 
finalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for 
certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed ( such 
as loans and commitments, intangible assets and leases),  
which may take place up to one  year from the acquisition 
date , as permitted by U.S. GAAP.
In connection with the First Republic acquisition,  the Firm 
and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with 
respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments 
(the "shared-loss assets"): the Commercial Shared-Loss 
Agreement ("CSLA") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss 
Agreement (“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers  80%  of credit 
losses, on a pari-passu basis, over  5 years  with a 
subsequent  3-year  recovery period for certain acquired 
commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The 
SFSLA covers  80%  of credit losses, on a pari-passu basis, 
for 7 years  for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages 
on real property or shares in cooperative property 
constituting a primary residence . The indemnification assets 
which represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA are 
reflected in the total assets acquired.As part of the consideration paid , JPMorgan Chase issued  a 
five-year , $50 billion  secured note to the FDIC (the 
"Purchase Money Note"). The Purchase Money Note bears 
interest at a fixed rate of  3.4%  and is secured by certain  of 
the acquired loans . The Purchase Money Note is prepayable 
upon notice to the FDIC.
The Firm had placed  a $5 billion  deposit with First Republic 
Bank on  M a r c h  1 6 ,  2 0 2 3, as part of  $30 billion  of deposits 
provided by a consortium of large U.S. banks.  The Firm's $5 
billion  deposit was effectively settled  as part of the 
acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses 
was released upon closing.  The Firm  subsequently  repaid 
the remaining  $25 billion  of deposits  to the consortium of 
banks, including accrued interest  through the payment date 
on M a y  9 ,  2 0 2 3.

The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by  the Firm for the following 
assets acquired and liabi lities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss agreements and the 
related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances.
Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of  the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies for 
securities, loans , deposits, and lending-related commitments.
Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles
Core deposit and certain wealth management customer 
relationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First 
Republic transaction. The core deposit intangible of  $1.3 
billion  was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost 
savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using 
the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost 
savings w ere estimated based on the difference between 
the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the 
cost of next best alternative funding sources available to 
market participants. The customer relationship intangibles 
of $187 million  were  valued by discounting estimated after-
tax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the 
multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset 
valuations utilized assumptions  that the Firm believes a 
market participant would use to estimate fair values , such 
as gr owth and attrition rate s, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships, and discount 
rates. The core deposit and customer relationship 
intangibles will be amortized over a projected period of 
future cash flows of approximately  7 years . As of June 30, 
2023, the carrying values of the core deposit and customer 
relationship intangibles were  $1.2 billion  and $183 million , 
respectively , reflecting accumulated amortization of 
approximately  $30 million  and $4 million , respectively .
Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements
The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries 
from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over 
the respective shared loss recovery periods. The 
indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other 
assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the 
acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification 
assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted 
losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses.  
195
The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the 
indemnification assets will be based on changes in amount 
and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit 
losses associated with the shared loss assets and will be 
recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances,  the 
Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon 
termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the 
level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss 
assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected 
as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price 
consideration.Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances
The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on 
the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the 
Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted 
cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market 
discount rates.  
The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded 
in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair 
value of the FHLB advances was based on a discounted cash 
flow methodology and  considered the observed FHLB 
advance issuance rates.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the 
“Firm”) as of J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, and the related consolidated 
statements of income, comprehensive income and changes 
in stockholders’ equity for the three-month and six-month 
periods ended June 30,2023 and 2022 and the 
consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month 
periods ended J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3 and 2022 , including the 
related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim 
financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not 
aware of any material modifications that should be made to 
the accompanying interim financial statements for them to 
be in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of 
the Firm as of D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the 
year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report 
dated February 21, 2023, which included a paragraph 
describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit 
losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we 
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated 
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set 
forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
information as of D e c e m b e r  3 1 ,  2 0 2 2, is fairly stated, in all 
material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance 
sheet from which it has been derived.  Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial 
information consists principally of applying analytical 
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the 
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements 
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an 
opinion.

derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a

another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence 
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, 
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its 
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the 
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the 
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to 
the protection seller for the difference between the face

settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as 
to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by

Embedded derivatives:  are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of 
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner 
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms 
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of 
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred 
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid 
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument 
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the 
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a 
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, 
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a 
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio” : For residential real estate 
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between 
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of 
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.
Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination 
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual 
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the 
origination date.
Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current 
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated 
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home 
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area 
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist 
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data 
where actual data is not available. As a result, the 
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do 
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; 
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise 
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.
Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well 
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV 
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Mortgage product types :
Alt-A  
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A 
lending characteristics may include one or more of the 
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; 
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) 
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial 
proportion of  the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a 
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his 
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.
Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the 
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only 
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option 
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the 
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually 
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed 
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once 
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and 
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The 
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest 
202
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is 
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. 
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which 
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan 
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date 
triggers.
Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related 
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage 
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have 
reliable payment histories.
Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or 
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a 
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the 
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) 
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all 
sources of funds.
NFA:  National Futures Association
NM: Not meaningful
Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is not 
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status 
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more 
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of 
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically 
maintained on nonaccrual status.
Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain 
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real 
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

total net revenue.
Parent Company:  JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: represents unvested share-based 
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to 
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, 
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share 
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase 
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees 
under its share-based compensation programs, which 
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the 
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested 
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under 
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and 
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock 
and participating securities, based on their respective rights 
to receive dividends.
PCD:  “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent 
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition 
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in 
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.
Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” 
approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital 
requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and

Pillar 3:  The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” 
approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through 
disclosure requirements which allow market participants to 
assess the risk and capital profiles of banks.

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue 
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this 
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a 
lending institution to generate income in excess of its 
provision for credit losses.
Principal transactions revenue : Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer 
spread, which is the difference between the price at which  
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and 
the price at which  the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. 
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or 
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and 
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and 
losses on financial and other instruments (including those 
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in 
client-driven market-making activities and on private equity 
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities,  the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue 
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and 
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives 
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships 
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign 
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk 
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and 
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”:  Basel III establishes two 
comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which 
include capital requirements for  credit risk, market risk, and 
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk.  Key 
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive 
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally 
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall 
fund performance:
Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in 
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services rank 
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over 
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and 
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide 
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the 
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating 
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is 
derived from a weighted average of the performance 
associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if 
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled 
funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual 
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on 
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with 
fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence 
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer 
207
categories and the asset values used to derive these 
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating 
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers 
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage 
of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for 
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the star rating of all other funds, except for 
Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. 
The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not 
indicative of future results.
Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in 
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and 
five years):  All quartile rankings, the assigned peer 
categories and the asset values used to derive these 
rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. 
Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute 
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating 
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The 
percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and 
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and 
Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. 
The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not 
indicative of future results.
“Primary share class ” means the C share class for 
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and 
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the 
oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About 
Market Risk.
Refer to the Market Risk Management section of 
Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 131-138  of 
JPMorgan Chase ’s 2022  Form 10-K  for a discussion of the 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an 
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with 
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial 
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, 
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 
for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.
The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of 
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, 
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all 
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls 
may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance 
that any such deficiencies will not result in significant 
deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the 
future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to 
“Management’s report on internal control over financial 
reporting” on page 155  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-
K for further information. 
On May 1, 2023, the Firm acquired certain assets and 
assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the 
FDIC. The Firm has included  internal controls over these 
acquired assets and assumed liabilities in its evaluation of 
the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures. 
Otherwise, there was no change in the Firm’s internal control 
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during 
the three months ended  J u n e  3 0 ,  2 0 2 3, that has materially 
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting. 
Part II – Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

proceedings in Note 26 of this Form 10-Q  for information

Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk 
factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk 
Factors on pages 9-32  of JPMorgan Chase ’s 2022  Form 10-K  
and Forward-Looking Statements on page 95 of this Form 
10-Q. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets 
forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should 
not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a 
complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition of certain assets and 
liabilities of First Republic Bank may not result in all of the 
benefits anticipated.
On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired certain  
assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank 
from the FDIC (the “First Republic acquisition”). There can be 
no assurance that the First Republic acquisition will have the 
anticipated positive results, including with respect to:
•the total cost of integration
•the time required to complete the integration
•the amount of longer-term cost savings
•the overall performance of the assets and liabilities 
acquired in the First Republic acquisition, or
•an improved price for JPMorgan Chase’s common stock.
Integration of an acquired business can be complex and 
costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant 
accounting and data processing systems and management 
controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with 
employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. 
Integration efforts could divert management attention and 
resources, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s 
operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could 
incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the 
First Republic acquisition and its integration efforts.
Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that 
cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or 
cause clients and customers to move their business to 
competing financial institutions. It is possible that the 
integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing 
businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, 
procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, 
customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of 
key employees in connection with the First Republic 
acquisition  could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to 
successfully conduct its business.
