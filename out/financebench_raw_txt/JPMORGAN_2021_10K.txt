Firm culture
The foundations of JPMorgan Chase’s culture are its core 
values and How We Do Business Principles, which are 
fundamental to the Firm’s success and are repres ented by 
four central corporate tenets: exceptional client service; 
operational excellence; a commitment to integrity, fairness 
and responsibility; and cultivation of a great team and 
winning culture. The Fi rm maintains its focus on its culture 
of inclusion and respect, which is reinforced by its Code of 
Conduct and throu gh increasing employee awareness and 
education, communication and training. An important part 
of these efforts includes the Firm’s Business Resource 
Groups, which are groups of employees who support 
JPMorgan Chase’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategies 
by leveraging the unique perspectives of their members. 
The Firm has global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of 
excellence, several of which were launched in 2021, that 
lead the Firm’s strategy in  supporting  its com mitments to 
create more equity and l asting impact in communities , and 
strengthen its inclusive culture.
Attracting and retaining employees
The goal of JPMorgan Chase’s recruitment efforts is to 
attract and hire talented individuals in all roles and at all 
career levels. The Firm strives to provide both external 
candidates and internal employees who are seeking a 
different role with challenging and stimulating career 
opportunities. These opportunities range from internship 
training programs for students to entry-level, management 
and executive careers. During 2021, approximately two 
thirds of the Firm’s employment opportunities were filled 
by external candidates, with the remainder filled by e xisting 
employees.
Diversity is an important area of focus throughout the 
Firm’s hiring process. JPMorgan Chase engages in efforts 
aimed at hiring diverse talent, including initiatives focused 
on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, LGBT+ 
individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others. 
The Firm’s global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of 
excellence seek to increase representation of and advance 
career opportunities for talented diverse individuals across 
the Firm through initiatives such as career coaching and 
mentorship. 
JPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program 
that seeks to attract accomplished individuals who have 
taken a career break and wish to return to the workforce.  
In addition, where appropriate, the Firm’s hiring practices 
focus on the skills of a job candidate rather than degrees 
held.Developing employees
JPMorgan Chase supports the professional development 
and career growth of its employees. An onboarding training 
curriculum is required for new hires, which covers Code of 
Conduct, compliance and cybersecurity, among other 
topics. In addition, the Firm offers extensive training 
programs to all employees, covering  a broad variety of 
topics such as leadership, change management, analytical 
thinking, culture and conduct, diversity , equity and 
inclusion, and risk and controls . Leadership Edge, the Firm’s 
global leadership development Center of Excellence, is 
focused on creating one Firm leadership culture.
Compensation and benefits
The Firm provides market-competitive compensation and 
benefits programs. JPMorgan Chase’s compensation 
philosophy provides the guiding principles that drive 
compensation-related decisions across the Firm, including 
pay-for-performance, responsiveness and alignment with 
shareholder interests, reinforcement of the Firm’s culture 
and How We Do Business Principles, and integration of risk, 
controls and conduct considerations. The Firm’s 
commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for all 
employees includes compensation review processes that 
seek to ensure that the Firm’s employees are paid equitably 
and competitively for the work they do.
The Firm also supports employees’ well-being. JPMorgan 
Chase offers an extensive benefits and wellness package to 
employees and their families, including healthcare 
coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, 
on-site health and wellness centers, employee assistance 
programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup 
child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs, 
mental health counseling and support, and financial 
coaching. The Firm has taken action to protect and support 
its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, including 
continued implementation of health and safety protocols, 
and providing additional benefits. For more information on 
the Firm’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to 
Business Developments on page 50.

Supervision and regulation
The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive 
regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the 
applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which 
the Firm does business.  
Financial holding company:
Consolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a bank 
holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding company 
(“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to 
comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and 
examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal 
Reserve acts as the supervisor of the consolidated 
operations of BHCs . Certain of JPMorgan Chase’s 
subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional 
authorities based on the activities or licenses of those 
subsidiaries.
JPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and, with 
respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (the “FDIC”).
JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and 
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
(“FINRA”) . Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain 
futures-related and swaps-related activities a re supervised 
and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (“CFTC”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.-
based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation 
Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct 
Authority (“FCA”). 
The Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the 
banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory 
authorities in the countries in which they operate. 
Permissible business activities . The Bank Holding Company 
Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other 
than the business of banking and certain closely-related 
activities. FHCs can engage in a broader range of financial 
activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an 
FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if 
the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries 
ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The 
Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or 
managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are 
persistent, may require divestiture of the FHC’s depository 
institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an 
FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the 
Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must 
prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any 
new activities other than those permissible for BHCs, or 
acquiring a company engaged in such activities. 
Capital and liquidity requirements . The Federal Reserve 
establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for 
JPMorgan Chase that are generally consistent with the international Basel III capital and liquidity framework and 
evaluates the Firm’s compliance with those requirements. 
The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.  Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries 
and branches are also subject to local capital and liquidity 
requirements.
Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and 
enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial 
institutions. In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued 
“Minimum capital requirements for market risk.” The Basel 
Committee expects national regulators to implement these 
revised market risk requirements for banking organizations 
in their jurisdictions by January 2023, in line with the other 
elements of the Basel III Reforms. U.S. banking regulators 
have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel 
III Reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply 
such reforms in the U.S.  
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  and

Stress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to 
supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal 
Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) 
framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run 
stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to 
the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of 
separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal 
Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the results under the 
severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to 
determine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) 
requirement for the coming year, which forms part of the 
Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to file 
its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2022. The Federal 
Reserve will notify the Firm of its indicative SCB 
requirement by June 30, 2022 and final SCB requirement 
by August 31, 2022. The Firm’s final SCB requirement will 
become effective on October 1, 2022. The OCC requires 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar 
stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the 
results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse” 
scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  for more 
information concerning the Firm’s CCAR.
Enhanced prudential standards . As part of its mandate to 
identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the 
U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) recommends 
prudential standards and reporting requirements to the 
Federal Reserve for systemically important financial 
institutions (“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal 
Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those 
heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to 
risk management and corporate governance of subject 
BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under these rules to 
comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk Part I
4
management standards, including oversight by the board of 
directors of risk management activities.
Resolution and recovery . The Firm is required to maintain a 
comprehensive recovery plan, updated annually, 
summarizing the actions it would take to avoid failure by 
remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an 
adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is 
required to prepare and submit a recovery plan as directed 
by the OCC. The Firm is required to submit periodically to 
the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution in 
the event of material distress or failure (a “resolution 
plan”). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve revised the 
regulations governing resolution plan requirements, and on 
the basis of those revisions, the Firm’s resolution plan 
submissions will alternate between “targeted” and “full” 
plans. The Firm’s “targeted” resolution plan was filed on 
June 28, 2021 . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required  
to prepare and submit a separate resolution plan as 
directed by the FDIC. 
Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are 
also subject to local resolution and recovery planning 
requirements.
Orderly liquidation authority . Certain financial companies, 
including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, 
can also be subjected to resolution under an “orderly 
liquidation authority.” The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in 
consultation with the President of the United States, must 
first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary 
financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be 
recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent 
such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to 
resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued 
a draft policy statement describing its “single point of 
entry” strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly 
liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating 
subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on 
shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership 
according to their statutory order of priority.  
Holding company as a source of strength.  JPMorgan Chase & 
Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for 
its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit 
resources to support those subsidiaries, including when 
directed to do so by the Federal Reserve. 
Regulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs and their 
banks are subject to requirements, limitations and 
prohibitions established by law and by the Federal Reserve 
and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to 
obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they 
acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an 
unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial 
companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, 
the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 
10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. 
Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must 
provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to 
acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in 
assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in 
nature.”
Ongoing obligations . The Firm is subject to obligations 
under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
entered into with the Department of Justice on September 
29, 2020 relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries 
markets investigations as well as under a related order 
issued by the CFTC.
Subsidiary banks: 
The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm’s 
principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically 
authorized under the National Bank Act and related 
interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring 
a n  e n f o r c e m e n t   a c t i o n  a g a i n s t  J P M o r g a n  C h a s e  B a n k ,  N . A .  
for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could 
include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to 
conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing 
corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank.
FDIC deposit insurance.  The FDIC deposit insurance fund 
provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is 
funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.  
FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency.  Upon the insolvency of 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as 
conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets 
and liabilities without the approval of the institution’s 
creditors.   
Prompt corrective action.  The Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant 
federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective 
action” with respect to a depository institution if that 
institution does not meet certain capital adequacy 
standards. T he Federal Reserve is also authorized to take 
appropriate action against the parent  BHC , such as 
JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized status 
of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would 
be required to guarantee the performance of the capital 
restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.  
OCC Heightened Standards.  The OCC has established 
guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large 
banks, including minimum standards for the design and 
implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. 
Under these standards, a bank’s risk governance framework 
must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily 
distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for 
risk management purposes. The bank’s board or risk 
committee is responsible for approving the bank’s risk 
governance framework, providing active oversight of the 
bank’s risk-taking activities, and holding management 
accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.
Restrictions on transactions with affiliates.  JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions 
imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, 
5
investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, 
securities lending and certain other transactions with, 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain other affiliates. These 
restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other 
affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the 
loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with 
certain other requirements.  
Dividend restrictions.  Federal law imposes limitations on the 
payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of 
dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at 
January 1, 2022, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval 
of the banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve 
also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of 
dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in the 
banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would 
constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the 
financial condition of the bank. 
Depositor preference.  Under federal law, the claims of a 
receiver of an IDI for administrative expense and the claims 
of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and 
deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the 
U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims 
of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including 
depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders. 
Consumer supervision and regulation.  JPMorgan Chase and  
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and 
regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(“CFPB”) with respect to federal consumer protection laws, 
including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of 
unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection 
with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial 
products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over 
small business lending activities with respect to fair lending 
and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its 
regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take 
enforcement actions against firms that offer certain 
products and services to consumers using practices that are 
deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The Firm’s 
consumer activities are also subject to regulation under 
state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General 
or empowered agency of each state.
In September 2021, the Firm launched a retail bank in the 
U.K. operating through J.P. Morgan Europe Limited  
(“JPMEL”) and acquired Nutmeg Saving and Investment 
Limited, a U.K. online digital investment manager 
(“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and both 
JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA with respect to 
their conduct of financial services in the U.K., including 
obligations relating to the fair treatment of customers. 
JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems 
Regulator with respect to its operation and use of payment 
systems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL and 
Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection legislation.Securities and broker-dealer regulation: 
The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and 
brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan 
Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer 
subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the 
SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among 
others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities 
outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In 
the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan 
Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and 
regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, 
including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, 
publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the 
financing of client purchases, capital structure, record-
keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, 
officers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory 
capital on page 96  for information concerning the capital of 
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.
Investment management regulation: 
The Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are 
subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the 
world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and 
management of client assets, offerings of funds and 
marketing activities. Certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries are 
registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as 
investment advisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s 
registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary 
and other obligations imposed under the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940, as well as various state securities 
laws. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities are subject to 
supervision by the OCC. 
Derivatives regulation: 
The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its 
derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose 
capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of 
standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, 
mandate that certain standardized OTC swaps be traded on 
regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of 
certain mandated information. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc 
are registered with the CFTC as “swap dealers” . In addition, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 
registered with the SEC as “security-based swap dealers” 
effective November 2021.  As a result, these entities are 
subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework 
applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, 
including capital requirements, rules requiring the 
collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based 
swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty 
collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, 
record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud 
and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar requirements 
have also been established under the European Market 
Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and MiFID II, as 
implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K. Part I
6
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the CFTC 
as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the 
National Futures Association. 
Data, privacy and security regulation: 
The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous U.S. 
federal, state and local as well as international laws, rules 
and regulations concerning data that are central to the 
Firm’s businesses, functions and operations. These include 
laws, rules and regulations relating to data protection, 
privacy, data use, confidentiality, secrecy, cybersecurity, 
technology, artificial intelligence, data localization and 
storage, data retention and destruction, disclosure, 
transfer, availability, integrity and other similar matters. 
Numerous jurisdictions have passed laws, rules and 
regulations in these areas and many are considering new or 
updated ones that could affect the Firm’s businesses. Many 
of these laws apply not only to the Firm’s transactions with 
third parties but also to interactions between and among 
the Firm’s own affiliates and subsidiaries. The application, 
interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and 
regulations are often uncertain, particularly in light of new 
and rapidly evolving data-driven technologies and 
significant increase in computing power. These laws, rules 
and regulations are constantly evolving, remain a focus of 
regulators globally, may be enforced by private parties or 
government bodies, and will continue to have a significant 
impact on all of the Firm’s businesses and operations.
The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions: 
The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial 
institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, 
to establish a risk-based system of internal controls 
reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the 
financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-
keeping and reporting requirements, as well as due 
diligence/know-your-customer documentation 
requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations 
and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. 
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). In 
addition, the EU and the U.K. have adopted various 
economic sanctions programs targeted at entities or 
individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, 
involved in terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human 
rights violations. The Firm is also subject to economic 
sanctions laws, rules and regulations in other jurisdictions 
in which it operates, including those that conflict with or 
prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying 
with certain laws, rules and regulations to which it is 
otherwise subject.
Anti-Corruption: 
The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to 
corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and 
others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.
Compensation practices:  
The Firm’s compensation practices are subject to oversight 
by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC 
and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive 
compensation paid by banking organizations does not 
encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the 
organizations’ safety and soundness. The Financial Stability 
Board (“FSB”) has also established standards covering 
compensation principles for banks. The Firm’s 
compensation practices are also subject to regulation and 
oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions , notably the 
Fifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as 
implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which 
includes compensation-related provisions. The European 
Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on 
compensation policies including under CRD V which in 
certain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or 
supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. Th e U.K. 
regulators have also instituted guidelines on C RD V 
compe nsation policies. The Firm expects that the 
implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding 
compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue 
to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm 
structures its compensation programs and practices.
Other significant international regulatory initiatives:   
Policymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement an 
extensive program of regulatory enhancem ents relating to 
financial services, several key elements of which are 
discussed below.
U.K. and EU policymakers have recently proposed changes 
to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID 
II”). MiFID II, which requires the trading of shares and 
certain standardized OTC derivatives to take place on 
trading venues and also significantly enhanced 
requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, 
transaction reporting and investor protection, and 
introduced a position limits and reporting regime for 
commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission 
published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to 
MiFID II focused on changes to the transparency and market 
structure rules , including the proposed creation of a 
consolidated tape intended to provide investors with a 
holistic view of trading across the EU. This legislation is 
subject to review by the European Parliament and Council. 
In the U.K., Her Majesty’s Treasury (“HMT”) and the FCA 
have undertaken a review of MiFID II, as adopted in the U.K. 
In July  2021, HMT published its ‘Wholesale Markets Review’ 
consultation, which proposed a broad range of changes 
covering most parts of the MiFID II legislation. HMT is 
expected to release its related policy statement in the first 
quarter of 2022. Detailed consultations with specific rule 
proposals relating to the HMT policy statement are 
expected from the FCA during 2022.  
In November 2021, EU legislators agreed to delay 
implementation of the mandatory buy-in rules required 
under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation 
(“CSDR”), which were previously scheduled to become 
effective on February 1, 2022 . In the interim, the European 
Securities and Markets Authority published a letter 
7
directing EU competent authorities to not prioritize 
supervisory action against firms under the CSDR.  The U.K. 
previously announced in July 2020 that it would not be 
adopting the CSDR settlement discipline regime, which 
includes both the buy-in regime and the penalty regime.
The U.K. and EU have also proposed various reforms for the 
derivatives market, including proposed amendments to 
clearing obligations  (“CO”) under the European Markets and 
Infrastructure Regulation and to derivatives trading 
obligations (“DTO”) under the Markets in Financial 
Instruments Regulation, including issuing final rules to 
change the CO and DTO to reflect industry transition away 
from IBORs to risk-free reference rates . 
The finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards for 
banks and investment firms, including in relation to the 
leverage ratio, counterparty credit risk capital, large 
exposures and the net stable funding ratio, have been 
implemented through legislation that became effective in 
the EU in June 2021 and in the U.K. on January 1, 2022. 
The Firm’s banking entities in the U.K. and EU will also be 
required to comply with certain changes made by the Basel 
Committee to the Basel III framework, including revisions to 
the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods, 
when they are implemented in those jurisdictions. EU 
legislation also requires that certain non-EU banks  
operating in the EU establish a n intermediate parent 
undertak ing (“IPU”) located in the EU. The IPU legislation 
allows a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would 
conflict with “home country” bank separation rules or 
impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to  comply 
with the EU’s IPU requirements, to the extent applicable, by 
December 30, 2023. 
The Firm’s banking entities in the U.K. and EU are subject to 
supervisory expectations published by the PRA and 
European Central Bank (“ECB”), respectively, for 
management of financial risks arising from climate change. 
These supervisory expectations address bank strategy, 
governance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk 
reporting and disclosure. Part I

The above summary is subject in its entirety to the 
discussion of the  risk factors set forth below.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could harm 
the global economy and negatively affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s businesses.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization 
declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus 
disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 
pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic, 
which included the institution of social distancing and 
shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. 
and other countries, resulted in a dverse impacts on global 
economic conditions, including:
• significant disruption and volatility in the financial 
markets
• significant disruption of global supply chains, and 
• closures of many businesses, leading to loss of 
revenues and increased unemployment.  
The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic 
have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s 
businesses and results of operations, including:
• reduction in demand for certain products and 
services from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and 
customers, resulting in lower revenue, and• increases in the allowance for credit losses during 
the early stages of the pandemic.
Although global economic conditions have been improving 
despite the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, any 
ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the 
pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the 
pandemic, including as a result of additional waves or 
variants of the COVID-19 disease or the emergence of other 
diseases that have similar outcomes, could have significant 
adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of 
operations and financial condition, including:
• recognition of charge-offs and increases in the 
allowance for credit losses, including any delayed 
recognition of charge-offs due to the impact of 
government stimulus actions or payment 
assistance provided to clients and customers
• material impacts on the value of securities, 
derivatives and other financial instruments which 
JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes 
markets
• downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings
• constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated 
levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets 
(“RWA”) related to supporting client activities, 
downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory 
actions or other factors, any or all of which could 
require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from 
taking actions that it otherwise would under its 
liquidity and capital management strategies, and
• the possibility that significant portions of 
JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work 
effectively, including because of illness, 
quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, 
government actions or other restrictions in 
connection with the pandemic.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively 
affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations 
and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and 
liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are 
uncertain and cannot be fully predicted, including:
• the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic 
• the effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines, and 
their availability in certain regions
• actions taken by governmental authorities and 
other third parties in response to the pandemic, 
and
• the effect that the pandemic or any prolongation 
or worsening of the pandemic may have on the 
pace of economic growth, inflation, the strength of 
labor markets, particularly in light of the 
expiration of government assistance programs, 
and the potential for changes in consumer Part I
10
behavior that could have longer-term impacts on 
certain economic sectors.
In addition, JPMorgan Chase's participation in U.S. 
government programs designed to support individuals, 
households and businesses impacted by the economic 
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, whether 
directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and 
clients or by affiliated entities, newly-acquired businesses 
or companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal 
investments, could be criticized and subject JPMorgan 
Chase to:
• increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny
• negative publicity, and 
• increased exposure to litigation,  
any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s 
operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its 
reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic 
adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of 
operations and financial condition, it may also have the 
effect of heightening many of the other risks described 
below. 
Regulatory
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and 
the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan 
Chase have a significant impact on its business and 
operations.
JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations 
worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, 
rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of 
the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. 
Regulation of the financial services industry is extensive.
The regulation and supervision of financial services firms 
has expanded significantly over an extended period of time. 
The increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan 
Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and 
structures its operations. JPMorgan Chase could be required 
to make further changes to its business and operations in 
response to expanded supervision or to new or changed 
laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments 
could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs in 
connection with complying with applicable laws, rules and 
regulations, which could reduce its profitability. 
Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s  entry into or acquisition of 
a new business or an increase in its principal investments 
may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional 
laws, rules, and regulations.
In resp onse to new and existing laws, rules and regulations 
and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past 
been and cou ld in the future be, required to:
• limit the products and services that it o ffers
• reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its 
market-making activities• refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it 
might otherwise pursue
• pay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other 
governmental charges, including in connection with the 
resolution of tax examinations
• incur losses with respect to fraudulent transactions 
perpetrated against its customers
• dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices 
that are disadvantageous
• impose restrictions on certain business activities, or
• increase the prices that it charges for products and 
services, which could reduce the demand for them.
In particular, JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of 
operations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws, 
rules and regulations, or changes in the application, 
interpretation or enforcement of laws, rules and 
regulations, that:
• proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on 
certain financial services activities
• impose new requirements relating to the impact of 
business activities on environmental, social and 
governanc e (“ESG”) concerns, the management of risks 
associated with those co ncerns and the offering of 
products intended to achieve ESG-related objectives, or
• introduce changes to antitrust or anti-competition laws, 
rules and regulations that adversely affect the business 
activities of JPMorgan Chase.  
Differences in financial services regulation can be 
disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.
The content and application of laws, rules and regulations 
affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according 
to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in 
which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For 
example:
• larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject 
to more stringent supervision and regulation
• financial technology companies and other non-
traditional competitors may not be subject to banking 
regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state 
regulatory agency that does not have the same 
resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory 
agencies which supervise more diversified financial 
services firms, or 
• the financial services regulatory framework in a 
particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions 
that are based in that jurisdiction.
These types of differences in the regulatory framework can 
result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to 
competitors that are less regulated or not subject to 
regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial 
products.
11
There can also be significant differences in the ways that 
similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services 
industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries 
and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For 
example, when adopting rules that are intended to 
implement a global regulatory standard, a national 
regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive 
requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages 
for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that 
may be subject to those enhanced regulations.
Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could 
require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications 
to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant 
countries or regions in order to comply with those 
requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations 
that have been adopted or proposed relating to:
• the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding 
companies or operating subsidiaries
• requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital 
or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries
• the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking 
products and services from markets activities
• the resolution of financial institutions
• requirements for executing or settling transactions on 
exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)
• position limits and reporting rules for derivatives
• governance and accountability regimes
• conduct of business and control requirements, and
• restrictions on compensation.
These types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in 
financial services regulation have required and could in the 
future require JPMorgan Chase to:
• divest assets or restructure its operations
• absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity 
costs 
• change the prices that it charges for its products and 
services 
• curtail the products and services that it offers to its 
customers and clients
• curtail other business opportunities, including 
acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise 
would have pursued, or 
• incur higher costs for complying with different legal 
and regulatory frameworks. 
Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s 
ability to compete against other firms that are not subject 
to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory 
oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of 
operations and profitability.Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan 
Chase to significant penalties and collateral 
consequences, and could result in higher compliance 
costs or restrictions on its operations.
JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened 
oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many 
jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, 
provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties 
and experienced other repercussions in connection with 
resolving investigations and enforcement actions by 
governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become 
subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in 
the future, and addressing the requirements of any such 
resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase 
incurring higher operational and compliance costs, 
including devoting substantial resources to the required 
remediation, or needing to comply with other restrictions. 
In connection with resolving specific regulatory 
investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators 
have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial 
institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the 
activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of 
admissions can lead to:
• greater exposure in litigation
• damage to reputation
• disqualification from doing business with certain clients 
or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or
• other direct and indirect adverse effects.
Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated 
a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial 
institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty 
to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in 
connection with resolving regulatory investigations or 
enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have 
significant collateral consequences for the subject financial 
institution, including:
• loss of clients, customers and business
• restrictions on offering certain products or services, 
and 
• losing permission to operate certain businesses, either 
temporarily or permanently.
JPMorgan Chase expects that: 
• it and other financial services firms will continue to be 
subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and 
governmental investigations and enforcement actions
• regulators will continue to require that financial 
institutions be penalized for actual or deemed 
violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement 
actions, including the imposition of significant 
monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving 
these matters through informal supervisory actions; 
and  Part I
12
• regulators will be more likely to pursue formal 
enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan 
Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject 
to other governmental investigations or enforcement 
actions.
If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any 
resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement 
action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet 
the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, 
it could be required to, among other things:
• enter into further resolutions of investigations or 
enforcement actions
• pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into 
judgments, or
• accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes 
in the management of, its businesses.
In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become 
subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil 
litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an 
investigation or enforcement action.
JPMorgan Chase can face greater risks of non-compliance 
and incur higher operational and compliance costs under 
laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-money 
laundering, economic sanctions , embargo programs and 
anti-corruption .
JPMorgan Chase must comply with laws, rules and 
regulations throughout the world relating to anti-money 
laundering, economic sanctions, embargo programs and 
anti-corruption which can increase its risks of non-
compliance and costs associated with the implementation 
and maintenance of complex compliance programs. A 
violation of any of these legal and regulatory requirements 
could subject JPMorgan Chase, or individual employees, to 
regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil 
and criminal penalties. In addition, certain national and 
multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside 
the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that 
conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase 
from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it 
is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also 
increase its risks of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.
JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can be 
negatively impacted in countries with less predictable 
legal and regulatory frameworks .
JPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in 
certain countries in which the application of the rule of law 
is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:
• the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or 
guidance for engaging in specific types of business or 
transactions
• conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or 
the inconsistent application or interpretation of 
existing laws, rules and regulations• uncertainty concerning the enforceability of 
contractual, intellectual property or other obligations
• difficulty in competing in economies in which the 
government controls or protects all or a portion of the 
local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or 
corruption may be pervasive, and 
• the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil 
litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of 
licenses required to operate in the local market or the 
suspension of business relationships with governmental 
bodies.
If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in a 
particular country is susceptible to producing inconsistent 
or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult 
environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business 
and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations 
and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For 
example, conducting business could require JPMorgan 
Chase to devote significant additional resources to 
understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules 
and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to 
comply with local laws, rules and regulations and 
implementing and administering related internal policies 
and procedures.
There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always 
be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to 
conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and 
regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, 
and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries 
that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems.
Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan 
Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to 
restructure or reorganize its businesses and could 
increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its 
business es.
JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and 
FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those 
agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in 
bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in 
the event of material financial distress or failure. The 
agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan 
may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may 
be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or 
modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to 
make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain 
internal or external activities, which could increase its 
funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve 
clients and customers.
If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine 
that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has 
deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent 
capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on 
J P M o r g a n  C h a s e ’ s  g r o w t h ,  a c t i v i t i e s  o r  o p e r a t i o n s .   T h e  
agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase 
restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in 
13
ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s operations and strategy. 
Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity 
securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a 
resolution.
Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
(the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of 
unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-
absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for 
purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating 
subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a 
resolution either:  
• in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  
• in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II 
of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  
If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, 
holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities 
of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent 
Company and its subsidiaries.  
The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under 
JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only 
the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy 
proceedings.   J P M o r g a n  C h a s e ’ s  s u b s i d i a r i e s  w o u l d  b e  
recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue 
normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound 
down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent 
Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries 
would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s 
equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, 
including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. 
Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior 
position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s 
subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by 
statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.   
Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in 
bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt 
securities of the Parent Company would realize value only 
to the extent available to the Parent Company as a 
shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other 
subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and 
secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully 
repaid.  
The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry 
recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to 
resolve a systemically important financial institution, such 
as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC 
has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution 
strategy.  
If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a 
resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal 
Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s 
preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of 
eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately 
followed, could be greater than they might have been under 
JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.  
Political
Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political 
developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s 
businesses.
Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can 
cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market 
conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its 
businesses. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy 
initiatives and proposals could significantly affect U.S. and 
global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the 
financial markets, including:
• monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal 
Reserve and other central banks or governmental 
authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset 
purchases or any suspension or reversal of those 
actions
• fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and 
spending
• actions that governments take or fail to take in 
response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as 
well as the effectiveness of any actions taken
• isolationist foreign policies
• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other 
geopolitical instabilities
• economic sanctions
• the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist 
trade policies, or
• other governmental policies or actions adopted or 
taken in response to political or social pressures.
These types of political developments, and uncertainty 
about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:
• erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and 
financial markets, which could potentially undermine 
the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency 
• provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other 
countries and otherwise heighten tensions in 
diplomatic relations 
• lead to the withdrawal of government support for 
agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal 
National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. 
GSEs”)
• increase concerns about whether the U.S. government 
will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at 
any particular time
• result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or 
governments in other countries Part I
14
• increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal 
Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor 
perceptions concerning government support of sectors 
of the economy or the economy as a whole
• adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings 
of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan 
Chase does business, or
• cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in 
business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.
These factors could lead to:
• slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession
• greater market volatility
• a contraction of available credit and the widening of 
credit spreads 
• erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial 
assets 
• diminished investor and consumer confidence
• lower investment growth
• large-scale sales of government debt and other debt 
and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries
• reduced commercial activity among trading partners
• the potential for a currency redenomination by a 
particular country
• the possible departure of a country from, or the 
dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty
• potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or 
• other market dislocations, including the spread of 
unfavorable economic conditions from a particular 
country or region to other countries or regions.
Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan 
Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in 
its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital 
levels, increase credit risk, hamper its ability to deliver 
products and services to its clients and customers, and 
weaken its results of operations and financial condition.
Market
Economic and market events and conditions can 
materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and 
investment and market-making positions.
JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively 
affected by adverse changes in any of the following:
• investor, consumer and business sentiment
• events that reduce confidence in the financial markets
• inflation or deflation
• high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor 
market
• the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit• levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and 
market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, 
and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility
• the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of 
hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, 
cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe 
weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of 
infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other 
extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control, 
and
• the health of the U.S. and global economies.
All of these are affected by global economic, market and 
political events and conditions, as well as regulatory 
restrictions.
In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and 
market-making businesses can suffer losses due to 
unanticipated market events, including:
• severe declines in asset values
• unexpected credit events
• unforeseen events or conditions that may cause 
previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated 
(and vice versa)
• the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks 
related to market-making and investment portfolio 
positions, or
• other market risks that may not have been 
appropriately taken into account in the development, 
structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.
If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its 
investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this 
could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity 
and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its 
businesses.
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively 
affected by adverse economic conditions and 
governmental policies .
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly 
affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:
• personal and household income distribution
• unemployment or underemployment
• prolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates
• housing prices
• the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods 
and services
• consumer and small business confidence levels, and
• changes in consumer spending or in the level of 
consumer debt .
15
Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment 
that result in reduced personal and household income could 
negatively affect consumer credit performance to the 
extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. 
In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest 
rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions 
could diminish customer demand for the products and 
services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. 
Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase 
in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses 
and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan 
Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly 
worse in certain geographies and industry segments where 
declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted 
in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or 
where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding 
student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay 
their other consumer loan obligations.
JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses 
could also be adversely affected by governmental policies 
and actions that affect consumers, including:
• policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, 
education, immigration, employment status and 
housing, and
• policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as 
higher taxes and increased regulation which could 
result in reductions in consumer disposable income.
In addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan 
obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings 
could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan 
Chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and 
thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and 
other consumer loans extended to those customers. 
Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an 
adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale 
businesses.
In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and 
economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that 
JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it 
advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan 
Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can 
also influence the willingness of other financial institutions 
and investors to participate in capital markets transactions 
that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or 
securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and 
sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, 
the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets 
businesses, including its loan syndication, securities 
underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be 
reduced to the extent that those businesses:
• earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction 
volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable 
to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in 
unfavorable market conditions, or• dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or 
hold larger residual positions in credit commitments 
that cannot be sold at favorable prices.
An adverse change in market conditions in particular 
segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe 
downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity 
prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that 
affect specific economic sectors, could have a material 
adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose 
operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly 
dependent on the health or stability of those market 
segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are 
engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur 
losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients 
that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the 
economy that is under stress.
The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client 
assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be 
diminished by declining asset values or other adverse 
macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest 
rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the 
valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or 
holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of 
assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse 
macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt 
outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause 
clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. 
Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan 
Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of 
the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the 
fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or 
prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the 
weaker investment performance.
An economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer 
behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business 
spending could also have a negative impact on certain of 
JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish 
JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. 
For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s 
wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of 
rental income from commercial real estate properties which 
are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse 
economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental 
cash flows that owners or developers receive from their 
tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the 
properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or 
refinance their commercial real estate loans. These 
consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing 
increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher 
delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its 
commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher 
costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in 
that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings 
from its wholesale businesses.Part I
16
Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can 
adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and 
income streams related to its traditional banking and 
funding activities. 
In general, a low or negative interest rate environment may 
cause:
• net interest margins to be compressed, which could 
reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its 
investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is 
unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-
yielding instruments
• unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor 
behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s broader asset and liability management 
strategy
• JPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount of deposits that 
it accepts from customers and clients, which could 
result in lower revenues, and
• a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage 
servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing 
revenues.
When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for 
JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit 
spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events 
and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but 
also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events 
and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads 
will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s 
earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are 
recorded at fair value. 
When interest rates are increasing, JPMorgan Chase can 
generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. 
However, higher interest rates can also lead to:
• fewer originations of commercial and residential real 
estate loans
• losses on underwriting exposures
• the loss of deposits, including in the event that 
JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about 
depositor behavior
• unrealize d mark-to-market losses on available-for-sale 
(“AFS”) securities held in the investment securities 
portfolio
• lower net interest income if central banks introduce 
interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated 
and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of 
short-term and long-term borrowings
• less liquidity in the financial markets, and
• higher funding costs.
All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher 
interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer 
and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable 
interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable 
to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may 
reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing 
JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational 
costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent 
loans. 
JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by 
market fluctuations and significant changes in the value 
of financial instruments.
The value of securities, derivatives and other financial 
instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it 
makes markets can be materially affected by market 
fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions 
and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it 
extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. 
Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future 
periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in 
significant changes in the value of these instruments. In 
addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial 
instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately 
realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the 
market at that time and may be materially lower than their 
current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a 
decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan 
Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have 
an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of 
operations.
JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring 
processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to 
quantify and control JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more 
extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s 
hedging and other risk management strategies may not be 
effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme 
market events were to occur.
Credit
JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse 
changes in the financial condition of clients, 
counterparties, custodians and CCPs.
JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients 
and counterparties such as corporations, financial 
institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities 
exchanges and government entities within and outside the 
U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to 
the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can 
involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client 
or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be 
subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that 
it has appointed to provide custodial services for client 
assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the 
failure to abide by existing laws and obligations .
A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP 
through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would 
require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby 
17
increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in 
losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to 
losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also 
a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of 
requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a 
portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can 
be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses 
incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, 
settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other 
security breaches.
As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is 
exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which 
it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate 
collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day 
credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash 
management, clearing, custodial and other transaction 
services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan 
Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or 
insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become 
involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, 
the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be 
subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing 
events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and 
litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to 
the extent that any collateral that it has received is 
insufficient to cover those losses.
Transactions with government entities, including national, 
state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can 
expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, 
operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, 
among other things, claim that actions taken by 
government officials were beyond the legal authority of 
those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a 
previous incumbent government. These types of actions 
have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, 
JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to 
conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.
In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit 
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation 
in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to 
make previously agreed-upon payments, which could 
subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.
Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives 
contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement 
procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The 
disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase 
to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal 
costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can 
also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage 
its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause 
harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
The financial or operational failure of a significant market 
participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or 
concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market 
participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial 
markets. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it 
leads to other market participants incurring significant 
losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and 
JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant 
interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a 
significant market participant.
JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses  if the value of 
collateral declines in stressed market conditions.
During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan 
Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when:
• JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the 
collateral it holds
• collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient 
to recover the full amount owed to it, or
• counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether 
for operational or other reasons.
Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the 
valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant 
market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase 
could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to 
realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in 
the value of collateral.
JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising 
from concentrations of credit and market risk.
JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market 
risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or 
counterparties:
• engage in similar or related businesses, or in 
businesses in related industries
• do business in the same geographic region, or
• have business profiles, models or strategies that could 
cause their ability to meet their obligations to be 
similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. 
For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality 
of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties 
could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other 
borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or 
dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could 
exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market 
risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, 
including fair value losses in its market-making businesses 
and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may 
be required to increase  the allowance for credit losses with 
respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with 
directives or expectations of its banking regulators. 
Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a 
particular industry or geographic area could lead to 
concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s 
borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular 
industry or geography but in related or dependent 
industries, wherever located. These conditions could also 
heighten concerns about the ability of customers of Part I
18
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those 
areas or work in those affected industries or related or 
dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan 
Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various 
segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess 
the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its 
efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those 
risks may not be successful.
JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed 
by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or 
non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain 
types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide 
reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or 
margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-
creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers 
subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak 
credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this 
could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to 
JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other 
credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on 
consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the 
U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses 
may earn lower revenues in such an environment.
If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively 
during a market dislocation, this can increase both the 
market and credit risks associated with those positions and 
the level of RWA that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance 
sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability 
of its businesses.
Liquidity
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could 
be impaired if its liquidity is constrained. 
JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given 
time by factors such as:
• market-wide illiquidity or disruption
• unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including 
as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations
• inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable 
times or prices
• default by a CCP or other significant market participant
• unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral
• unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than 
anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, 
and
• lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan 
Chase or financial institutions in general. 
A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by 
events over which it has little or no control. For example, 
during periods of market stress, low investor confidence 
and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access 
to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. 
JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative 
sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of 
funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal 
Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of 
funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. 
JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively 
affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order 
to:
• satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net 
stable funding ratio requirements
• address obligations under its resolution plan, or
• satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside 
the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in 
subsidiaries that are material legal entities.
More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively 
manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund 
or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby 
adversely affect its results of operations.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends 
on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on 
its outstanding securities.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the 
stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate 
holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the 
“ I H C ” ) .   T h e  I H C  i n  t u r n  g e n e r a l l y  h o l d s  t h e  s t o c k  o f  
JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other 
assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding 
company. 
The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC 
substantially all the net proceeds received from securities 
issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated 
debt securities and of preferred and common stock).
The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to 
make payments to the holding company is also 
l i m i t e d .   J P M o r g a n  C h a s e  B a n k ,  N . A .  i s  s u b j e c t  t o  r e g u l a t o r y  
restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital 
adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary 
Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and 
other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments 
to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying 
dividends or extending credit to the holding company if 
certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if 
limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s 
management or Board of Directors. 
As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding 
company to make various payments is dependent on its 
receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and 
dividends and  borrowings from the IHC. T hese limitations 
could affect the holding company’s ability to:
• pay interest on its debt securities
19
• pay dividends on its equity securities
• redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and
• fulfill its other payment obligations.
These arrangements could also result in the holding 
company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or 
otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time 
earlier than would have been the case absent the existence 
of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is 
subject.
Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may 
adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal 
subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating 
agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and 
industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for 
a particular financial institution, including:
• expected future profitability 
• risk management practices
• legal expenses
• ratings differentials between bank holding companies 
and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries
• regulatory developments 
• assumptions about government support, and 
• economic and geopolitical developments. 
JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the 
extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit 
r a t i n g s .   H o w e v e r ,  t h e r e  i s  n o  a s s u r a n c e  t h a t  J P M o r g a n

times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s 
options for responding to events may be more limited and 
general investor confidence is low.
A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail 
JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its 
profitability in a number of ways, including:
• reducing its access to capital markets 
• materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing 
securities 
• triggering additional collateral or funding 
requirements, and 
• decreasing the number of investors and counterparties 
that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend 
to JPMorgan Chase.
Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads 
charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan

adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.The reform  and replacement of benchmark rates could 
adversely affect financial instruments issued, funded, 
serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase and expose it to 
litigation and other disputes. 
Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types 
of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,” including 
those in widespread and longstanding use, have been the 
subject of ongoing international, national and other 
regulatory scrutiny and initiatives for reform, including:
• changes to the rules and methodologies under which 
certain benchmarks are administered
• initiatives designed to discourage or prohibit the use of 
certain benchmarks by market participants
• the introduction of alternative reference rates to be 
used by market participants in lieu of certain 
benchmarks, and
• legislative proposals and actions providing for the 
replacement of reference rates under existing contracts 
and instruments that are linked to certain benchmarks 
with alternative reference rates .
Some of these reforms are already effective while others 
are still to be implemented or are under consideration. 
These and other reforms relating to benchmarks could: 
• cause certain benchmarks to be substantially modified 
or to be permanently discontinued 
• lead to disruptions in the financial markets, including  in 
connection with the  transition to alternative reference 
rates
• give rise to litigation and other disputes
• cause reputational harm to the extent that operational 
and technology systems are not sufficiently prepared 
for the transition to alternative reference rates, or 
• have other consequences which cannot be fully 
anticipated.
Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to 
regulate, reform or change the administration of 
benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the 
return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, 
securities, derivatives and other financial instruments 
whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including 
those issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.
Changes in the manner in which certain benchmarks are 
administered, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny 
of those benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of 
administering or otherwise participating in the setting of 
those benchmarks and complying with regulations or 
requirements relating to those benchmarks. Such factors 
may have the effect of discouraging market participants 
from continuing to administer or contribute to certain 
benchmarks, trigger further changes in the rules or 
methodologies under which certain benchmarks are Part I
20
administered or lead to the discontinuation  of certain 
benchmarks.
Regulators, industry bodies and other market participants 
in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in 
initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of 
alternative reference rates to replace certain benchmarks, 
and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are 
gaining acceptance among market participants. However, 
there is no assurance that: 
• any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the 
economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek 
to replace
• arrangements by market participants to prepare for the 
discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the 
transition to alternative reference rates will be fully 
effective, or
• a particular alternative reference rate will be widely 
accepted by market participants, or that market 
acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the 
introduction of other reference rates.  
If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an 
alternative reference rate has not been successfully 
introduced or widely accepted within the market, this could 
result in significant adverse effects on the financial 
markets. For example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, 
securities, derivatives and oth er financial instruments are 
linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) 
benchmark. ICE Benchmark Administration, the 
administrator of LIBOR, has announced that the publication 
of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease after 
June 30, 2023, and significant progress has been made by 
regulators, ind ustry bodies and market participants to 
introduce and  implement the Secured Overnight Financing 
Rate (“SOFR”) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. 
However, if an alternative reference rate such as SOFR has 
not achieved sufficient market acceptance when the 
publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR is 
discontinued, or if market participants have not otherwise 
implemented effective transitional arrangements to address 
that discontinuation, this could result in widespread 
dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing 
of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and the 
suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could 
have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of 
operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit 
or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or 
held by JPMorgan Chase. 
JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation 
and other types of disputes with clients, customers, 
counterparties and investors as a consequence of the 
transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark 
rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan 
Chase has: • treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors 
unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher 
financing costs or lower returns on investments
• failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the 
transition from benchmark rates on the products that 
JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers,   
or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest
• made inappropriate product recommendations to or 
investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products 
that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection 
with the transition from benchmark rates
• engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the 
manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in 
connection with the discontinuation of or transition 
from benchmark rates, or
• disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or 
investors when interpreting or making determinations 
under the terms of agreements or financial 
instruments.
These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to 
higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to 
pay significant amounts in connection with resolving 
litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.
Capital
Maintaining the required level and composition of capital 
may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business 
activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and 
distribute capital to shareholders.
JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital 
requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital 
requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically 
Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to 
hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, 
a SCB, and a countercyclical buffer , each of which is 
reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that 
JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these 
leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any 
given time due to factors such as:
• actions by banking regulators, including changes in 
laws, rules, and regulations
• actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S. 
government in response to the economic effects of 
systemic events, such as the actions taken in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of 
the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth  in deposit s 
held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial 
institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage 
exposure and the GSIB surcharge
• changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s 
balance sheet or developments that could increase risk  
weighted assets such as increased market risk, 
customer delinquencies, client credit rating 
downgrades or other factors, and
21
• increases in estimated stress losses as determined by 
the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital 
Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan 
Chase’s SCB.
Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain 
the required level and composition of capital, or 
unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, 
could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s 
shareholders, such as:
• reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan 
Chase is permitted to repurchase
• requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the 
redemption of, capital instruments in a manner 
inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital 
management strategy
• constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid 
on common stock, or
• curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or 
operations.
Operational
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the 
effectiveness of its operational systems and those of 
other market participants.
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of 
JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction 
execution, data processing and other operational systems 
to process, record, monitor and report a large number of 
transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, 
quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, 
installation, maintenance and training, the effective 
functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems 
depends on:
• the quality of the information contained in those 
systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can 
significantly compromise the functionality or reliability 
of a particular system and other systems to which it 
transmits or from which it receives information, and
• the ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain 
and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to 
ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are 
managed carefully to ensure security and operational 
continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and 
use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and 
other market participants, including clearing and payment 
systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, 
security and technology companies (including those that 
provide cloud computing services). 
The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of 
operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, 
including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or 
other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and 
its clients and customers, including:
• delays or other disruptions in providing services, 
liquidity or information to clients and customers
• the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to 
funds and other assets, including those for which 
physical settlement and delivery is required
• failure to timely settle or confirm transactions
• the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets 
trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, 
as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended 
consequences
• financial losses, including due to loss-sharing 
requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other 
market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to 
clients and customers
• higher operational costs associated with replacing 
services provided by a system that is unavailable
• client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan 
Chase’s products and services
• regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against 
JPMorgan Chase
• loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or 
financial institutions generally, to protect against and 
withstand operational disruptions, or
• harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and 
complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can 
become more challenging to effectively maintain and 
upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and 
infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:
• attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or 
its clients and customers may increase, evolve or 
become more complex, particularly during periods of 
market disruption or economic uncertainty
• errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market 
participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause 
widespread system disruption
• isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational 
systems compound, or migrate to other systems over 
time, to become larger issues
• failures in synchronization or encryption software, or 
degraded performance of microprocessors, could cause 
disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of 
systems to communicate with each other, and
• third parties may attempt to block the use of key 
technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes 
on their intellectual property rights.
If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of newly-
acquired businesses or of external parties on which Part I
22
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet 
the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and 
operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or 
have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could 
be materially and adversely affected.
A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could 
cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients 
and customers.
JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous attempted cyber 
attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and 
other technology assets on a daily basis from various 
actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile 
countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or 
groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or 
social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take 
many forms, including attempts to introduce computer 
viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to 
as “malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These 
attacks are often designed to:
• obtain unauthorized access to confidential information 
belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, 
counterparties or employees
• manipulate data
• destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering 
services unavailable
• disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan 
Chase’s systems
• steal money, or
• extort money through the use of so-called 
“ransomware.”
JPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed 
denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt 
online banking services.
JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to 
cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional 
breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could 
result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan 
Chase or its clients and customers.
A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide 
absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not 
always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats 
to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective 
preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:
• the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently 
and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may 
not be recognized until launched
• cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of 
sources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees, 
cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist 
organizations or hostile countries, or third parties 
whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial 
institutions more generally• JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the 
cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of 
clients, customers, counterparties and third-party 
service providers with which it does business, and
• it is possible that a third party, after establishing a 
foothold on an internal network without being 
detected, might obtain access to other networks and 
systems.
The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could 
increase in the future due to factors such as: 
• JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile 
banking and other internet-based product offerings and 
its internal use of internet-based products and 
applications, including those that use cloud computing 
services
• the acquisition of new businesses, and
• the increased use of remote access and third party 
video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from-
home arrangements for employees. 
In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential 
information obtained by intercepting signals or 
communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan 
Chase’s employees.
A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of 
JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, 
governmental body or another market participant could 
cause serious negative consequences, including:
• significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations 
and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, 
including losing access to operational systems
• misappropriation of confidential information of 
JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, 
counterparties, employees or regulators
• disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems  
and those of its clients, customers and counterparties
• the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully 
recover and restore data that has been stolen, 
manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent 
systems from processing fraudulent transactions
• violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and 
other laws
• financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,  
customers, counterparties or employees
• loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity 
and business resiliency measures
• dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, 
customers or counterparties
• significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, 
penalties or other sanctions, and
• harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
23
The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that 
JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack 
may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant 
amount of time before such an investigation can be 
completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, 
JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of 
the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may 
continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan 
Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information 
about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, 
counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. 
Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and 
remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain 
errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before 
they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these 
factors could further increase the costs and consequences 
of a cyber attack.
JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to 
identify and address operational risks associated with the 
introduction of or changes to products, services and 
delivery platforms.
When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, 
introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of 
products or services (including mobile connectivity, 
electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests 
in a business or makes changes to an existing product, 
service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or 
identify new operational risks that may arise from those 
changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to 
mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any 
significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan 
Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or 
result in:
• potential liability to clients, counterparties and 
customers
• increased operating expenses
• higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, 
penalties and other sanctions
• damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation
• impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity
• regulatory intervention, or 
• weaker competitive standing.
Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and 
adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of 
operations.
JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer 
satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of 
an external operational system.
External operational systems with which JPMorgan is 
connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of 
operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may 
be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack 
that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly 
connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack 
involving another party to which such a vendor or 
infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data 
aggregators and other external parties with which 
JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase 
JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the 
case where activities of customers or those parties are 
beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, 
including through the use of the internet, cloud computing 
services, and personal smart phones and other mobile 
devices or services. 
If an external party obtains access to customer account data 
on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that party experiences a 
cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that 
data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for 
JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:
• heightened risk that external parties will be able to 
execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan 
Chase’s systems
• losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential 
liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in 
consumer protection laws, rules and regulations
• increased operational costs to remediate the 
consequences of the external party’s security breach, 
and
• reputational harm  arising from the perception that 
JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.
As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, 
customers and other external parties continues to expand, 
JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational 
failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those 
parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s 
clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, 
security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting 
other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take 
steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems 
or to safeguard confidential information, including 
restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These 
actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs 
and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and 
confidence in JPMorgan Chase.
Furthermore, the widespread and expanding 
interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing 
banks , CCPs, payment processors, financial technology 
companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other 
financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the 
disruption of an operational system involving one institution 
or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause 
industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially 
affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.Part I

JPMorgan Chase’s operations rely on its ability, and the 
ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-
staffed workforces, and on the competence, 
trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses 
efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that 
meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to 
maintain an effective risk management framework is highly 
dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately 
and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its 
employees. JPMorgan Chase is similarly dependent on the 
workforces of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s 
operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial 
markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could 
be materially and adversely affected by:
• the ineffective implementation of business decisions
• any failure to institute controls that appropriately 
address risks associated with business activities, or to 
appropriately train employees with respect to those 
risks and controls
• staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets
• a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, 
fraud or other unlawful conduct, or
• other negative outcomes caused by human error or 
misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of 
another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations 
depend.
JPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if the 
measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help 
ensure the health and safety of its employees are 
ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan 
Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions 
to protect the health and safety of its employees.
JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational 
risks in safeguarding personal information.
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and 
evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and 
outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of 
personal information of individuals. The protected parties 
can include:
• JPMorgan Chase’s current, prospective and former 
clients and customers
• clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and 
customers
• current,  prospective and former employees, and
• employees of JPMorgan Chase’s vendors, 
counterparties and other external parties.
Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, sharing and 
storage of personal information comply with all applicable 
laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, 
including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in 
conflict, can:• increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating 
costs
• hinder the development of new products or services, 
curtail the offering of existing products or services, or 
affect how products and services are offered to clients 
and customers
• demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, and 
• require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, 
operations and systems in less efficient ways. 
Not all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors, 
counterparties and other external parties may have 
appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality 
of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan 
Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by 
electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to 
litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if 
personal information of clients, customers, employees or 
others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations 
where such information is:
• erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted 
to have the information, or
• intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized 
third parties.
Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s 
measures to safeguard personal information, or even the 
perception that those measures are inadequate, could 
cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients 
and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s 
revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by 
JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data 
protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to 
inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result 
in requ irements to modify or cease certain operations or 
practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties 
or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan 
Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its 
businesses.
In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the  
inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal 
information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of 
practices relating to the safeguarding of personal 
information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. 
That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the 
future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and 
regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and 
storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules 
and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict 
financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from 
sharing information among affiliates or with third parties 
such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or 
could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal data when 
developing or offering products or services to customers. 
These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s 
25
development or marketing of certain products or services, 
or increase the costs of offering them to customers.
JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation 
could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events 
beyond its control.
JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could 
be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, 
by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially 
beyond its control, including material instances of:
• cyber attacks
• security breaches of its physical premises, including 
threats to health and safety
• power, telecommunications or internet outages, or 
shutdowns of mass transit
• failure of, or loss of access to, technology or 
operational systems, including any resulting loss of 
critical data
• damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan 
Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, 
including in connection with any construction projects 
undertaken by JPMorgan Chase
• effects of climate change
• natural disasters or severe weather conditions
• accidents such as explosions or structural failures
• health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, 
epidemics or pandemics, or
• events arising from local or larger-scale civil unrest, 
any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or terrorist 
acts.
JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program 
that is intended to enable it to recover critical business 
functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology 
and facilities, in the event of a business disruption, 
including due to the occurrence of  an extra ordinary event 
beyond its control. There can be no assurance that 
JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all 
potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its 
clients, and customers and third parties with which it does 
business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to 
address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple 
business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s 
ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event 
could be hampered to the extent that the members of its 
workforce, physical assets or systems and other support 
infrastructure needed to address the event are 
geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event 
were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated. 
Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that 
cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, 
the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s 
business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more 
significant and l ong-lasting. 
Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s 
operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one 
or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control, 
could:
• hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to 
its clients and customers or to transact with its 
counterparties
• require it to expend significant resources to correct the 
failure or disruption or to address the event
• cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss 
of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries
• disrupt market infrastructure systems on which 
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely 
• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or 
other sanctions, and
• harm its reputation.
Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the 
oversight of vendors and other service providers can 
result in higher costs and other potential exposures.
JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and 
other standards associated with doing business with 
vendors and other service providers, including standards 
relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the 
performance of significant banking and other functions by 
subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and 
expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the 
risks associated with oversight of its internal and external 
service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately 
assess and manage these relationships, especially those 
involving significant banking functions, shared services or 
other critical activities, could materially adversely affect 
JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result 
in:
• potential harm to clients and customers, and any 
liability associated with that harm
• regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions
• lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost 
revenues
• increased operational costs, or
• harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not 
be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to 
JPMorgan Chase.
Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk 
management framework, governance structure, practices, 
models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected 
losses, and its financial condition or results of operations 
could be materially and adversely affected. Any such 
inadequacy or lapse could:Part I
26
• hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to 
JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of 
Directors
• lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes 
for JPMorgan Chase
• require significant resources and time to remediate
• lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations
• attract heightened regulatory scrutiny
• expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or 
legal proceedings
• subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or 
other sanctions
• lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and 
any liability associated with that harm
• harm its reputation, or 
• otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.
JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk 
exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of 
JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation 
processes could result in ineffective risk management 
practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate 
risk reporting.
Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and 
techniques consider historical market behavior and to some 
degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or 
assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan 
Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical 
correlations among prices of various asset classes or other 
market indicators. In times of market stress, including 
difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event 
of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated 
indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-
correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those 
times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated 
market or economic movements could, in some 
circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s 
risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.
JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its 
capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater 
regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or 
judgments, including those used in its financial 
statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.
JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of 
models and other analytical and judgment-based 
estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls 
over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and 
other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and 
estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in 
connection with the preparation of its financial statements 
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. 
GAAP”). These models and estimations are based on a variety of 
assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically 
reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and 
estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective 
in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a 
variety of factors, such as:
• reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the 
future, including assumptions underlying the models 
and estimations such as correlations among certain 
market indicators or asset prices
• inherent limitations associated with forecasting 
uncertain economic and financial outcomes
• historical trend information may be incomplete, or may 
not be indicative of severely negative market 
conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack 
of liquidity
• sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of 
certain loans and securities may make it more difficult 
to value certain financial instruments
• technology that is introduced to run models or 
estimations may not perform as expected, or may not 
be well understood by the personnel using the 
technology
• models and estimations may contain erroneous data, 
valuations, formulas or algorithms, and
• review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and 
estimations.
JPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if 
models, estimates or judgments used or applied in 
connection with its risk management activities or the 
preparation of its financial statements prove to have been 
inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market 
prices are not available for certain financial instruments 
that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan 
Chase may make fair value determinations based on 
internally developed models or other means which 
ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates 
and judgment. 
Similarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for 
expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which 
requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments 
including forecasts of how economic conditions might 
impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and 
counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. 
These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to 
be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. In 
addition, certain models used by JPMorgan Chase as a basis 
for the determination of the allowance for expected credit 
losses experienced heightened performance risk in the 
economic environment during the early stages of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. These models are based on historical 
experience of internally-developed macroeconomic 
scenarios, and when the current and forecasted 
environment is significantly different from the scenarios 
27
underlying those models, JPMorgan Chase may need to 
apply a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform 
any adjustments that it  has made or may make to model 
outputs.
Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing 
risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, 
JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required 
before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and 
estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA 
and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan 
Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its 
regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, 
which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the 
ability to expand its businesses. 
Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting 
could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or 
reputation.
There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s 
disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every 
circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant 
deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will 
not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in 
inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:
• materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s 
business and results of operations or financial 
condition
• restrict its ability to access the capital markets 
• require it to expend significant resources to correct the 
lapses or deficiencies
• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or 
other sanctions
• harm its reputation, or 
• otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan 
Chase. 
Strategic
If JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and 
execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate 
changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s 
competitive standing and results could suffer.
JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its 
c o m p e t i t i v e  s t a n d i n g  a n d  o p e r a t i o n s .   T h e s e  s t r a t e g i e s  
relate to:
• the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers
• the geographies in which it operates
• the types of clients and customers that it serves
• the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests
• the counterparties with which it does business, and 
• the methods and distribution channels by which it 
offers products and services. If management makes choices about these strategies and 
goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess 
the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to 
address changing regulatory and market environments or 
the expectations of clients, customers, investors, employees 
and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and 
growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may 
suffer and its earnings could decline.
JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on 
management’s ability to develop and execute effective 
business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in 
the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s 
effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s 
ability to develop and enhance its resources, control 
e x p e n s e s  a n d  r e t u r n  c a p i t a l  t o  s h a r e h o l d e r s .   E a c h  o f  t h e s e  
objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the 
part of management to:
• devise effective business plans and strategies
• offer products and services that meet changing 
expectations of clients and customers
• allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term 
stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest 
in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed 
environment
• allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise 
modeling or subjective judgments made in connection 
with those allocations
• appropriately address concerns of clients, customers, 
investors, employees and other stakeholders, including 
with respect to social and sustainability matters
• react quickly to changes in market conditions or market 
structures, or
• develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, 
financial and managerial resources necessary to grow 
and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.
Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in 
connection with disposing of excess properties, premises 
and facilities, and those costs could be material to its 
results of operations in a given period.
JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing 
competition in the rapidly evolving financial services 
industry.
JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive 
environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the 
significant changes as a result of changes in financial 
regulation, technological advances, increased public 
scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan 
Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global 
financial services industry will continue to be intense. 
Competitors include:
• other banks and financial institutions
• trading, advisory and investment management firmsPart I
28
• finance companies
• technology companies, and
• other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing 
similar products and services.
JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the 
significant competition in the financial services industry will 
not materially and adversely affect its future results of 
operations.
New competitors in the financial services industry continue 
to emerge. For example, technological advances and the 
growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-
depository institutions to offer products and services that 
traditionally were banking products. These advances have 
also allowed financial institutions and other companies to 
provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, 
including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, 
payments processing and online automated algorithmic-
based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial 
institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk 
that payments processing and other products and services, 
including deposits and other traditional banking products, 
could be significantly disrupted by the use of new 
technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other 
applications that use secure distributed ledgers, that 
require no intermediation. New technologies have required 
and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify 
or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and 
customers or to match products and services offered by its 
competitors, including technology companies. In addition, 
new technologies may be used by customers, or breached 
or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which 
can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with 
laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of 
products and services through those technologies and 
reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from 
providing products and services through those 
technologies.
Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the 
pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may 
cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly 
with respect to traditional banking products . This 
competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of 
products and services offered, transaction execution, 
innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of 
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of 
clients and customers, whether due to general market 
conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a 
particular product or service, changes in client and 
customer expectations or other factors, could affect 
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and 
customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce 
JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also 
may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital 
investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its 
capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain 
competitive.The effects of climate change could adversely impact 
JPMorgan Chase and its clients.  
JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and 
communities around the world where its businesses, and 
the activities of its clients and customers, could be impacted 
by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a 
financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in 
the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to 
a low-carbon economy, including changes in climate policy 
or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to 
risks posed by climate change.
Climate-related physical risks include acute weather events, 
such as hurricanes and floods, and chronic shifts in the 
climate, such as altered distribution and intensity of 
rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased 
frequency of wildfires, rising sea levels, or a rising heat 
index. Climate-related physical risks could have adverse 
financial and other impacts on JPMorgan Chase, both 
directly on its business and operations and as a result of 
impacts to its clients and customers, including:
• declines in asset values, including due to the 
destruction or degradation of property
• reduced availability of insurance
• significant interruptions to business operations, 
including supply chain disruption, and
• systemic changes to geographies, regional economies 
and sectors, and any resulting population migration or 
unemployment.
Transition risks arise from the process of adjusting to a low-
carbon economy. In addition to possible changes in climate 
policy and financial regulation, potential transition risks 
may include economic and other changes engendered by 
the development of low-carbon technological advances 
(e.g., electric vehicles and renewable energy) and/or 
changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon 
goods and services. Transition risks could be further 
accelerated by the occurrence of changes in the physical 
climate. The possible adverse impacts of transition risks to 
both JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers include: 
• sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated 
write-downs (“stranded assets”)
• increased operational and compliance costs driven by 
changes in climate policy and/or regulations 
• negative consequences to business models, and the 
need to make changes in response to those 
consequences, and
• damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including as a 
result of any perception that its business practices are 
contrary to public policy or stakeholder preferences.
Both physical risks and transition risks could have negative 
impacts on the revenues, financial condition or 
creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and 
on its exposure to those clients and customers.
29
Conduct
Conduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm 
clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage 
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and 
regulatory action.
JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, 
customers and counterparties, and with each other, every 
d a y .   A l l  e m p l o y e e s  a r e  e x p e c t e d  t o  d e m o n s t r a t e  v a l u e s  a n d  
exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan 
Chase’s Code of Conduct and How We Do Business 
Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do 
first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase 
endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout 
an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, 
training and development, and performance 
m a n a g e m e n t .   C o n d u c t  r i s k  m a n a g e m e n t  i s  a l s o  a n  i n t e g r a l  
component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and 
compensation processes.
Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, 
certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal 
conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have 
resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental 
investigations or enforcement actions involving consent 
orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution 
agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is 
no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions 
by employees will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms 
of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that 
any such actions will always be detected, deterred or 
prevented.
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and 
collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one 
or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance 
with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, 
including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, 
other market participants or other employees. Some 
examples of this include:
• improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s 
products or services
• engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or 
unauthorized trading
• engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in 
connection with government relief programs
• facilitating a transaction where a material objective is 
to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial 
disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by 
governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the 
proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the 
economic substance of the transaction
• failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties 
owed to clients or customers
• violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding 
with other market participants• using electronic communications channels that have 
not been approved by JPMorgan Chase
• engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment 
with respect to clients, customers or employees, or 
acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a 
diverse and inclusive workplace
• managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate 
JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business 
performance goals or employee compensation 
objectives, and
• misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary 
information, or technology assets belonging to 
JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third 
parties.
The consequences of any failure by one or more employees 
to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s 
expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, 
or regulatory or other governmental investigations or 
enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions 
could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or 
other sanctions, or lead to:
• financial losses
• increased operational and compliance costs
• greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties
• regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to 
restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities
• the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s 
management
• loss of clients or customers, and
• harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to 
newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to 
successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any 
of those employees do not conduct themselves in 
accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies 
and practices.
Reputation
Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its 
businesses.
Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability 
to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and 
employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can 
therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s 
business and prospects, and can arise from numerous 
sources, including:
• employee misconduct, including discriminatory 
behavior or harassment with respect to clients, 
customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to 
JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and 
inclusive workplacePart I
30
• security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks
• failure to safeguard client, customer or employee 
information
• failure to manage risk s associa ted with its business 
activities or those of its clients, including those that 
may be unpopular among one or more constituencies
• failure to fully discharge publicly-announced 
commitments to support social and sustainability 
initiatives
• non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations 
• operational failures
• litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other 
sanctions 
• actions taken in executing regulatory and 
governmental requirements during a global or regional 
health emergency
• regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or 
resolutions of these matters, and 
• failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules 
or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients, 
customers, counterparties or other parties, including 
newly-acquired businesses, companies in which 
JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, 
parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and 
vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged 
by adverse publicity or negative information regarding 
JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be 
published or broadcast by the media or posted on social 
media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the 
internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and 
pervasiveness with which information is disseminated 
through those channels.
Social and environmental activists are increasingly 
targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase 
with public criticism for their relationships with clients that 
are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including 
businesses whose products are or are perceived to be 
harmful to human health, or whose activities negatively 
affect or are perceived to negatively affect the 
environment, workers’ rights or communities. Activists have 
also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s 
headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of 
JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive 
industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among 
clients, customers, investors and employees with how 
JPMorgan Chase addresses social and sustainability 
concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to 
activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could 
damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients and 
customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in 
jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose 
views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm 
to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could:  
• cause certain clients and customers to cease doing 
business with JPMorgan Chase 
• impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients 
and customers, or to expand its relationships with 
existing clients and customers
• diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain 
employees
• prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with 
certain clients or customers.
• cause certain investors to divest from investments in 
securities of JPMorgan Chase, or
• attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory 
bodies.
Actions by the financial services industry generally or 
individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s 
reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a 
whole can be damaged by concerns that:
• consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial 
institution, or
• a financial institution has acted inappropriately with 
respect to the methods used to offer products to 
customers
If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these 
types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among 
clients or customers.
Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of 
interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in 
litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage 
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of 
interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its 
business activities which encompass a variety of 
transactions, obligations and interests with and among 
JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase 
can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, 
and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or 
perceived failure to:
• adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts 
of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that 
may arise in connection with providing multiple 
products and services in, or having one or more 
investments related to, the same transaction
• deliver appropriate standards of service and quality
• treat clients and customers with the appropriate 
standard of care
• use client and customer data responsibly and in a 
manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory 
expectations
31
• provide fiduciary products or services in accordance 
with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or 
• handle or use confidential information of customers or 
clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable 
data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations. 
A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address 
conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in 
customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, 
penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory 
scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to 
lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious 
harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.
Country
An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries 
or within a country or region could have a material 
adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan 
Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally. 
Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, 
including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could 
expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries 
or escalating into full-scale war with potentially 
catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of 
the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the 
scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:
• worldwide economic disruption
• heightened volatility in financial markets
• severe declines in asset values, accompanied by 
widespread sell-offs of investments
• substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially 
leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in 
the affected region
• disruption of global trade, and 
• diminished consumer, business and investor 
confidence.
Any of the above consequences could have significant 
negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and 
earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected 
by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to 
become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead 
to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase 
may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in 
any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. 
JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and 
aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the 
sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a 
conflict.
JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain 
countries can be adversely affected by local economic, 
political, regulatory and social factors.
Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts 
business have economies or markets that are less 
developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable 
than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In 
addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase 
conducts business, the local economy and business activity 
are subject to substantial government influence or control. 
Some of these countries have in the past experienced 
economic disruptions, including:
• extreme currency fluctuations
• high inflation
• low or negative growth, and
• defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.
The governments in these countries have sometimes 
reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive 
policies that adversely affect the local and regional business 
environment, s uch as:
• price, capital or exchange controls, including 
imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility 
restrictions or forced currency exchange
• expropriation or nationalization of assets or 
confiscation of property, including intellectual 
property, and
• changes in laws, rules and regulations. 
The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading 
markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than 
more-developed markets. These types of government 
actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations 
in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the 
business activities of local clients or multi-national clients 
that conduct business in the jurisdiction. 
In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain 
more developed countries, have been susceptible to 
unfavorable social developments arising from poor 
economic conditions or governmental actions, including: 
• widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general 
strikes 
• crime and corruption
• security and personal safety issues
• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities
• overthrow of incumbent governments
• terrorist attacks, and 
• other forms of internal discord. 
These economic, political, regulatory and social 
developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future 
could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan 
Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the 
revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In 
addition, any of these events or circumstances in one 
country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and 
investments in another country or countries, including in 
the U.S.Part I

People
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to  attract and retain qualified 
and diverse employees is critical to its success.
JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important 
resource, and in many areas of the financial services 
industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense . 
J P M o r g a n  C h a s e  e n d e a v o r s  t o   a t t r a c t  t a l e n t e d  a n d  d i v e r s e  
new employees and retain, develop and motivate its 
existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain 
talented and diverse employees can be particularly 
challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for 
recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable 
to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse 
employees, including successors to the Chief Executive 
Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other 
senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its 
competitive position, could be materially and adversely 
affected.
Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies 
could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and 
operations. 
JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and 
expertise of employees located throughout the world. 
Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and 
other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it 
more difficult for employees or their family members to 
work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in 
which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its 
business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract 
and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the 
quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to 
make structural changes to its worldwide or regional 
operating models that cause its operations to be less 
efficient or more costly.
Legal
JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from 
litigation and formal and informal regulatory and 
government investigations.
JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise 
involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions 
and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions 
currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in 
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions 
adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could 
materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, 
financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious 
reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services 
industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to 
experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and 
government investigations related to its businesses and 
operations.
Regulators and other government agencies conduct 
examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both 
on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan 
Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened 
regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation 
or examination, may lead to additional regulatory 
investigations or enforcement actions. There is no 
assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or 
other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. 
Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation 
of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and 
overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by 
multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the 
U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other 
governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
If another financial institution violates a law or regulation 
relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will 
often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other 
governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or 
practice by JPMorgan Chase. 
These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. 
governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to 
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, 
and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its 
operations and activities or to cease offering certain 
products or services. All of these potential outcomes could 
harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher 
operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s 
profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In 
addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal 
and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in 
some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan 
Chase has established for those matters.

Repurchases under the common share repurchase 
program
Refer to Capital actions in the Capital Risk Management 
section of Management’s discussion and analysis on page 
94 for information regarding repurchases under the Firm’s 
common share repurchase program.
On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share 
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized 
a new common share repurchase program for up to $ 3 0   b i l l i o n. As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and 
common stock dividends in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the 
Firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.
On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire on 
June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the 2021 CCAR 
stress test.  Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the 
regulatory capital framework. The Firm continues to be authorized to repurchase common shares under its existing common 
share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors.
Shares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during 2021  were as follows.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
The internal control framework promulgated by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”), “Internal Control — Integrated 
Framework” (“COSO 2013”), provides guidance for 
designing, implementing and conducting internal control 
and assessing its effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO 
2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021 . Refer to “Management’s report on internal control 
over financial reporting” on page 156 .
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an 
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with 
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial 
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, 
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls 
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
respectively.
The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of 
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, 
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all 
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls 
may occur from time to time, and there can be no 
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in 
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal 
control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal 
control over financial reporting” on page 156  for further 
information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal 
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 
13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that 
occurred during the three months ended  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to 
materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting.

2021 , or $15.36 per share, on net revenue of $121.6 
billion. The Firm reported ROE of 19% and ROTCE of 23%. 
The Firm's results for 2021  included a reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion.  
•The Firm had net income of $ 48.3 billion, up 66%,  driven 
by a net benefit  in the provision for credit losses, 
compared to an expense recorded in the prior year .
•Total net revenue was up 1%. 
–Noninterest revenue was $69.3 billion, up 6%, driven  
by higher Investment Banking fees and asset 
management fees, partially offset by lower CIB Markets 
revenue .
–Net interest income was $ 52.3 billion, down 4%, 
driven by the impact of lower market rates and 
changes in the balance sheet mix, partially offset by 
balance sheet growth .      •Noninterest expense was $71.3 billion, up 7%, 
predominantly driven by higher compensation expense 
and continued  investments in the business, including 
technology. 
•The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $9.3 
billion, driven by; 
–a $12.1 billion reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses primarily reflecting improvements in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook, and 
–$2.9 billion of net charge-offs predominantly driven by 
Card
The prior year provision was an expense of $17.5 billion, 
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
of $12.2 billion, and $5.3 billion of net charge-offs.
•The total allowance for credit losses was $18.7 billion at 
December 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.62%, 
compared with 2.95% in the prior year; the decrease 
from the prior year was driven by re ductions  in the 
allowance for credit losses.
•The Firm’s nonperforming assets  totaled $8.3 billion at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the 
prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting 
the impact of net por tfolio activity and client-specific 
upgrades in wholesale, as well as improved credit 
performance in consumer; and lower loans at fair value in 
the CIB consumer portfolio, largely due to sales.
•Firmwide average loans of $ 1.0 trillion were up 3%, 
driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, partially offset by 
lower loans in CCB and CB.
•Firmwide average deposits of $2.3 trillion were up 23%, 
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs, primarily 
driven by the effect of certain government actions in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as growth 
from existing and new accounts in CCB.

Business  Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, the 
Firm has remained focused on serving its clients, customers 
and communities, as well as the well-being of its employees. 
The Firm continues to actively monitor and adapt to health 
and safety developments at local and regional levels as 
more of its global workforce returns to the office.   
For information on the impact of U.S. government actions 
and programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer 
to:
•Credit Portfolio on page 109 for information on PPP,
•Consumer Credit Portfolio on page 112 and Wholesale 
Credit Portfolio on page 118 for information on retained 
loans under payment deferral, and
•Note 12 on page 231 for information on the Firm’s loan 
modification activities.Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition 
JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to 
make progress with respect to the transition from the use of 
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other 
IBORs to comply with the International Organization of 
Securities Commission’s standards for transaction-based 
benchmark rates. As of January 1, 2022, ICE Benchmark 
Administration ceased the publication of all tenors of LIBOR 
for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR 
(collectively, “non-U.S. dollar LIBOR”) and the one-week 
and two-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR. The cessation of 
the publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR 
(i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 
12-month LIBOR) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.
In joint statements issued by the Federal Reserve, the OCC 
and the FDIC, the banking regulators encouraged U.S. banks 
to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar 
LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021. The Firm 
has ceased  executing contracts that reference U.S. dollar 
LIBOR, with certain  permissible limited exceptions,  and no w 
offers various floating rate products, and provides and 
arranges various types of floating rate debt financings, 
across its businesses that reference replacement rates, 
including  the Secured Overnight Financin g Rate (“SOFR”). 
The Firm continues to engage with clients in relation to the 
transition from the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR and  
to support clients as they move to replacement rates.
On November 16, 2021 the Financial Conduct Authority 
(“FCA”) confirmed that it will allow, for a period of at least 
one year, the use of “synthetic” U.K. sterling and Japanese 
yen LIBOR rates in all legacy LIBOR contracts, other than 
cleared derivatives, that had not been transitioned to 
replacement rates by January 1, 2022. The use of these 
synthetic LIBORs, will allow market participants additional 
time to complete their transition to replacement rates or 
otherwise to reduce their exposure to contracts that do not 
have robust fallback mechanisms and that are difficult to 
amend.
During the fourth quarter of 2021 , the principal central 
counterparties (“CCPs”) converted cleared derivatives 
contracts linked to non-U.S. dollar LIBOR to replacement  
rates before the cessation of the publication of those 
LIBORs on December 31, 2021.
The Firm has made significant progress towards reducing its 
exposure to IBOR-referencing contracts, including in 
derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and 
debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to meet 
its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as  
the industry milestones and recommendations published by 
National Working Groups, including the Alternative 
Reference Rates Committee in the U.S. 
In connection with the transition from LIBOR, as of 
December 31, 2021 the Firm had remediated substantially 
all of the notional amount of its bilateral derivatives 
contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR and non-U.S. dollar Management ’s discussion and analysis
50 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
LIBOR, and substantially all of its non-U.S. dollar LIBOR-
linked loans . The Firm continues its client outreach with 
respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked loans .
The Firm is also on schedule to implement further 
necessary changes to risk management systems in order to 
transition from LIBOR, including modifications to its 
operational systems and models. In 2021, the Firm changed 
the rate basis of its transfer pricing methodology for U.S. 
dollar-denominated contracts to SOFR and implemented 
internal controls to restrict the use of LIBOR in new 
transactions .
Legislation intended to reduce the likelihood of disputes 
arising from the cessation of LIBOR has been adopted or 
proposed in certain jurisdictions. The Firm continues to 
review the extent to which these legislative actions or 
proposals, if enacted, may reduce the risk of litigation and 
disputes arising from the transition from LIBOR.
The Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry, 
market, regulatory and legislative developments, including 
the transition relief issued by the Internal Revenue Service 
and U.S. Treasury Department in January 2022 with respect 
to the tax implications of reference rate reform.

2021 compared with 2020
Investment banking fees  increased across products in CIB, 
reflecting:
•higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and 
wallet share gains
•higher equity under writing fees due t o a strong IPO 
market and wallet share gains , and
•higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by an 
active leveraged loan market primarily re lated to 
acquisition financing.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72  and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting:
•lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets, primarily in 
Rates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, Credit and 
Commodities, compared  to a strong prior year, and  an 
increase in Securitized Products,  and
•lower net valuation gains on several legacy equity 
investments in Corporate,
partially offset by
•higher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong 
performance across derivatives, prime brokerage, and 
Cash Equities•favorable results in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other, 
with a net gain of $250 million predominantly driven by 
valuation adjustments related to derivatives, compared 
with a $29 million net loss in the prior year, and
•the absence of losses recorded in the prior year in 
Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment 
transactions, which were more than offset by the related 
net interest income earned on these transactions, also in 
the prior year.
Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 67-72   
and pages 79-80 , respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees  increased as a result of:
•higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher 
lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees 
in CIB, 
predominantly offset by
•lower overdraft fee revenue i n CCB .
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66 ,  
pages 67-72  and pages 73-75 , respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue  increased driven by:
•higher asset management fees  in AWM and CCB as a 
result of higher average market levels and net inflows , 
and
•higher custody  fees in CIB Securities Services, primarily 
associated with higher assets unde r custody .
Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 
63-66 , pages 67-72  and pages 76-78 , respectively, and 
Note 6 for additional information. 
Investment securities gains/(losses)  reflected net losses  
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio, 
compared with net gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. 
GSE and government agency MBS. Refer to Corporate 
segment results on pages 79-80  and Note 10 for additional 
information.
Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:
•lower net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting a  net 
loss in MSR risk management results primarily driven by 
updates to model inputs related to prepayment 
expectations, and
•lower mortgage production revenue on lower production 
margins.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66 , Note 6 and 
15 for further information.
Card  income  increased  due to:
•higher net intercha nge income in CCB driven by an 
increase in debit and credit card sales volume above pre-
pandemic levels, partially offset by the impact of a 
renegotiation of a co-brand partner contract, as well as 
an increase to the rewards liability, andManagement ’s discussion and analysis
52 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
•higher payments revenue related to commercial card and 
merc hant processing  in CB and CIB on higher volume ,
partially offset by
•higher amortization related to new account origination 
costs in CCB.
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB seg ment results on pages 63-66 , 
pages 67-72  and pages 73-75 , respectively, and Note 6 for 
further information.
Other income  decreased reflecting:
•lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a 
decline in volume, and
•increased amortization on a higher level of alternative 
energy investments in the tax-oriented investment 
portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more 
than offset by lower income tax expense from the 
associated tax credits,
predominantly offset by
•net gains on several investments , primarily in CIB  and 
AWM , and
•the absence of losses recorded in the prior year related to 
the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-term 
debt in Treasury and CIO.
Net interest income decreased driven by the impact of  
lower market rates  and changes in the balance sheet mix, 
partially offset by balance sheet growth.  
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 
trillion, up $436 billion, predominantly driven by higher 
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield 
was 1.81%, down 53 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on 
these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.64%, a decrease of 34 
bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.91%, down 
39 bps.
Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial 
measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, 
interest and rates schedule on pages 300-304  for further 
details; and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s

2021 compared with 2020
The provision for credit loss es was a net benefit driven by 
net reductions in the allowance for credit losses.
The net benefit in consumer  was driven by:
•a $9.5 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook, including $7.6  billion in Card , and $1.2 billion in 
Home Lending, which also reflects continued 
improvements  in Home Price I ndex ("HPI") expectations, 
and
•lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated ;
•the prior year included a $7.4 billion net addition to the 
allowance for credit losses. 
The net benefit in wholesale  was due to a net reduction of 
$2.6 billion in the allowance for credit losses across the 
LOBs, reflecting improvements in the Firm's 
macroeconomic outlook. The prior year included a $4.7 
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses .

2021 compared with 2020
Compensation expense  increased across the LOBs  and 
Corporate, primarily from higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, as well as the impact of investments in the 
businesses.
Noncompensation expense  increased as a result of:
•higher volume-related expense, including outside 
services, predominantly  brokerage expense in CIB and 
distribution fees in AWM
•higher marketing expense predominantly driven by 
higher investments in marketing campaigns  and growth 
in travel-related benefits in CCB
•higher other investments, including technology  expense 
across the LOBs
•higher contribution expense, which included a $550 
million donation of equity investments to the Firm's 
Foundation in the first quarter of 2021, and
•higher other structural expense, including r egulatory-
related expense ,
partially offset by
•lower depreciation expense in CCB due to lower auto 
lease assets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral 
values
•lower legal expense, driven by CIB and AWM, and
•the absence of an impairment recorded in the prior year

(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 25 for further information.
Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in 
depo sits and limited deployment opportunities  in Treasury 
and CIO. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements 
of its excess cash with various central banks, including the 
Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements  decreased driven by:
•lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO, and lower 
client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets,
partially offset by
•higher collateral requirements in CIB Markets.
Securities borrowed  increased reflecting higher client-
driven activities and an increase in the demand for 
securities to cover short positions in CIB Markets.  
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.
Trading  assets  decreased reflecting;
•a lower level of securities, primarily  debt instruments 
related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB 
Fixed Income Markets
•lower derivative receivables, primarily as a result of 
mark et movements , as well as maturities of certain 
trades in CIB, and
•lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.Investment  securities  increased due to the net impact of 
purchases and paydowns in the available-for-sale (“AFS”) 
and held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolios, largely offset by 
sales in the AFS portfolio. In the second quarter of 2021, 
$104.5 billion of AFS were transferred to the HTM portfolio 
for capital management purposes.  Refer to Corporate 
segment results on pages 79-80 , Investment Portfolio Risk 
Management on page 132  and Notes 2 and 10 for 
additional information on investment securities.
Loans  increased, reflecting:
•highe r secured lending in CIB Markets; co ntinued strength 
in securities-based lending, custom lending and 
mortgages in AWM; and growth in Card,
partially offset by
•a decline in CBB and CB due to the net impact of PPP loan 
forgivenes s and loan originations,  and
•lower retained residential real estate loans in Home 
Lending primarily due to net paydowns.
The allowance for loan losses  decreased primarily as a 
result of improvements in the macroeconomic environment. 
The decline in the allowance consisted of:
•a $9.4 billion reduction in consumer, reflecting 
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, 
predominantly in t he credit card and residential real 
estate portfolios. The residential real estate portfolio also 
reflects continued improvements in HPI expectations , and
•a $2.5 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, 
reflecting  improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic 
outlook.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 55
There was a $148 million net reduction in the allowance for 
lending-related commitments, driven by both wholesale and 
consumer. This allowance is included in other liabilities on 
the consolidated balance sheets. The total net reduction in 
the allowance for credit losses was $12.1 billion, as of 
December 31, 2021.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
106-132 , and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable  increased due to 
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities 
primarily in CIB prime brokerage.
Refer to Note 16 and 18 for additional information on  
Premises and equipment .Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles  increased reflecting:
•higher MSRs as a result of net additions, partially offset 
by the realization of expected cash flows; and
•an increase  in Goodwill as a result of the acquisitions  of 
Nutmeg, OpenInvest, Frank, The Infatuation and Campbell 
Global.  
Refer to Note 15 for additional information.
Other assets increased due to the higher cash collateral 
placed with central counterparties ( "CCPs" ) in CIB, and 
higher tax receivables.

Deposits  increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the 
effect of certain government actions in response to the 
COVID -19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by 
growth from new and existing accounts across both 
consumer and small business customers.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 ; and 
Notes 2 and 17 for more information.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements  decreased due to lower 
secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury 
and CIO, and trading assets in CIB Markets . Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104  and Note 11 
for additional information. 
Short-term borrowings  increased as a result of higher 
financing of CIB Markets activities, as well as higher 
issuances of commercial paper in Treasury and CIO. Refer to

driven by lower issuances of commercial paper as a result 
of lower  loans in the Firm-administered multi-seller

securitizations in Treasury and CIO.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 ; and 
Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on Firm-
sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt  increased driven by net issuances, partially 
offset by  fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to 
higher rates, and maturities of Federal Home Loan Bank 
(“FHLB”) advances. Refer to Liquidity Risk Manag ement on 
pages 97-104  and Note 20 for additional information.
Stockholders’ equity  increased reflecting net income, 
partially offset by the net impact of capital actions, and a 
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
(“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was primarily driven by the 
impact of higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and 
cash flow hedges.  Refer to page 163  for information on 
changes in stockholders’ equity, and Capital actions on page

Operating activities 
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily 
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. 
These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the 
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of 
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk 
management activities and market conditions. The Firm 
believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and 
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash 
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to 
meet its operating liquidity needs.
•In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading 
assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities, 
partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower 
trading liabilities.
•In 2020, cash used primarily reflected higher trading 
assets, other assets, and securities borrowed, partially 
offset by higher trading liabilities and net income 
excluding noncash adjustments.Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include 
originating held-for-investment loans and investing in the 
investment securities portfolio, and other short-term 
instruments.
•In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of 
investment securities and higher net originations of 
loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under 
resale agreements.
•In 2020, cash used primarily reflected net purchases of 
investment securities, higher net originations of loans,  
and higher securities purchased under resale 
agreements.
Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer 
deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.
•In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net 
proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially 
offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements.
•In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and an 
increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements, partially offset by net payments of long-term 
borrowings. 
•For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements 
appear on pages 160-164 . That presentation, which is 
referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an 
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked 
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of 
the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial 
statements of other companies.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the 
overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide 
managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. 
The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed 
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each 
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes 
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the 
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an 
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that 
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from 
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to 
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial 
measures at the Firm and business-segment level because 
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide 
information to investors about the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular 
business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore, 
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment 
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to 
Business Segment Results on pages 61-80  for additional 
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP 
financial measures used by the Firm may not be 
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial 
measures used by other companies. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue 
excluding CIB Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and 
noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also 
reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown 
below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and 
Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, 
are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews 
these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s 
lending, investing (including asset-liability management) 
and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility 
associated with CIB Markets activities. In addition, 
management also assesses CIB Markets business 
performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur 
across revenue lines. Management believes that these 
measures provide investors and analysts with alternative 
measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.

(b)Refer to pages 70-71  for further information on CIB Markets.Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as 
follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets
ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end
* Represents net income applicable to common equity
In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures 
such as 
•Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 
excluding Firmwide legal expense, and
•Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 
less total noninterest expense.
Management believes that these measures help investors 
understand the effect of these items on reported results 
and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s 
performance.
The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to 
period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., 
total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related 
deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. 
TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by 
the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are  four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.  
The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis.  Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 58-60  for a 
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology 
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of 
capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. 
The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, 
methodologies and reporting classifications used for 
segment reporting, and further refinements may be 
implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also 
provide various business metrics which are utilized by the 
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing 
performance.
Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service, with 
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the 
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
corporate support units, or another business segment, the 
costs of those services are allocated to the respective 
business segments. The expense is generally 
a l l o c a t e d   b a s e d  o n  t h e  a c t u a l  c o s t  a n d  u s e  o f  s e r v i c e s  
provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related 
to corporate support units, technology and operations not 
currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to the 
business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense 
retained in Corporate generally includes  costs that would 
not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone 
businesses; and other items not aligned with a particular 
business segment.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the 
Firm allocates interest income and expense to each 
business segment and transfers the primary interest rate 
risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO within Corporate.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest 
rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities 
and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the 
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process 
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other 
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest 
income to the business segments .
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 61
As a result of the current interest rate environment and the 
excess liquidity stemming from government and central 
bank actions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities 
have generally declined, impacting the business segments 
net interest income. As such, during the period ende d 
December 31, 2021, this has resulted in lower cost of funds 
for loans and margin compression on deposits across the 
LOBs .
Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of 
the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding 
unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while the 
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term 
debt and preferred stock dividends to the business 
segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital 
requirements, as applicable. The allocated cost of 
unsecured long-term debt is included in a business 
segment’s net interest income, and net inc ome is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a business 
segment’s net income applicable to common equity.  
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  for 
additional information.
Capital allocation 
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred 
to as equity. The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates 
Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the 
GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe 
stress environment.  As of January 1, 2022, the Firm has 
changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as 
a result of changes in RWA for each LOB and to reflect an 
increase in the Firm’s GSIB surcharge to 4.0% that will be 
effective January 1, 2023.  The assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically 
reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs 
m a y  c h a n g e  f r o m  t i m e  t o  t i m e .   
Refer to Line of business equity on page 93  for additional 
information on capital allocation .

2021 compared with 2020 
Net income was $20.9 billion , up $12.7 billion , driven by a 
net benefit  in the provision for credit losses, compared to 
an expense in the prior year.
Net revenue was $50.1 billion , a decrease of 2%.
Net interest income was $32.8 billion , down 2%, driven by :
•the net impact in Card of lower revolving loans, primarily 
due to higher payments, and lower funding costs ,
largely offset by
•higher loans in Auto, and
•the accelerated recognition of deferred processing fees 
associated with PPP loan forgiveness, largely offset by 
the net impact of margin compression on higher deposits 
in CBB.
Noninterest revenue was $17.3 billion , down 3%, driven 
by:
•a decrease in mortgage fees and related income due to a 
net loss in MSR risk management results primarily driven 
by update s to model inputs related to prepayment 
expectations as well as lower p roduction margins, 
•lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 
in volume, and
•lower overdraft fee revenue,
largely offset by
•higher asset management fees as a result of higher 
average market levels and net inflows, and 
•higher card income due to higher net interchange income 
driven by an increase in debit and credit card sales 
volume above pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by the 
impact of a renegotiation of a co-brand partner contract, 
an increase to the rewards liability,  and higher 
amortization related to new account origination costs.
Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Critical 
Accounting Estimates on pages 150-153 , and Note 6 for 
additional information on card income. Noninterest expense was $29.3 billion , up 5%, reflecting:
•increased compensation  expense, as well as investments 
in technology and marketing campaigns, and growth in 
travel-related benefits,
partially offset by
•lower depreciation expense due to lower auto lease 
assets and the impact of higher vehicle c ollateral values .
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $7.0 
billion , compared with an expense of $12.3 billion  in the  
prior year,  driven by:
•a $9.8 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
reflecting impro vements in the Firm’s macroeconomic 
outlook, consisting of $7.6 billion in Card, $675 million in 
CBB, $300 million in Auto and $1.2 billion in Home 
Lending,  which also reflects continued improvements in 
HPI expectations, and 
•lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated .
The prior year included a $7.8 billion addition to the
allowance for credit losses.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting  
guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for 
purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are considered purchased 
credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Refer to Consumer Credit 
Portfolio on pages 110-116  and Note 12 for further information on PCD 
loans.
(a)At both D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , nonaccrual loans included 
$1.6 billion  of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual 
loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on 
each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.
(b)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 2020  and 2019 , nonaccrual loans excluded 
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $342 million , $558 million  and $963 million, 
respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the 
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to 
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as 
permitted by regulatory guidance.
(c)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , generally excludes loans that were 
under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116  for 
further information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes 
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment 
deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly 
all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.
(d)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , included $5.4 billion  and $19.2 
billion  of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The 
Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans 
because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio 
on pages 108-109  for a further discussion of the PPP.
(e)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020, the principal balance of loans in 
Home Lending, Card and Auto under payment deferral programs 
offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows: (1) 
$1.1 billion  and $9.1 billion  in Home Lending, respectively; (2) $46 
million  and $264 million  in Card, respectively; and (3) $115 million  
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 65
and $376 million  in Auto, respectively. Loans that are performing 
according to their modified terms are generally not considered 
delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116  for 
further information on consumer payment assistance activity.
(f)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , the 30+ day delinquency rates 
included PCD loans. The rate at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 1 9 was revised to 
include the impact of PCI loans.
(g)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 2020  and 2019 , excluded mortgage loans 
insured by U.S. government agencies of $405 million , $744 million  
and $1.7 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. 
These amounts have been excluded based upon the government 
guarantee.
(h)At December 31, 2021 , nonaccrual loans excluded $506 million  of 
PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA. 
(i)Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 
reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. 
Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions that arise from 
c l i e n t - d r i v e n  m a r k e t - m a k i n g  a c t i v i t y .   P r i n c i p a l  t r a n s a c t i o n s

c l i e n t  d e m a n d ,   a n d  c h a n g e s  i n  t h e  f a i r  v a l u e  o f  i n s t r u m e n t s  
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure 
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue 
recognized upon executing new transactions with market 
participants is affected by many factors including the level 
of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the difference between the price at which a market participant 
i s  w i l l i n g  a n d  a b l e  t o  s e l l  a n  i n s t r u m e n t  t o  t h e  F i r m   a n d  t h e

Net income was $5.2 billion, up $2.7 billion , predominantly 
driven by a net benefit in the provision for credit losses, 
compared to an expense in the prior year.
Net revenue was $10.0 billion, up 7%. Net interest income 
was $6.0 billion, down 3%, driven by the net impact of 
margin compression on higher deposits and a decrease in 
loans, largely offset by lower funding costs.  Noninterest 
revenue was $3.9 billion, up 28%, predominantly driven by 
higher investment banking and payments revenue . 
Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, up 6%, 
predominantly driven by investments in the business, 
including higher compensation expense, and higher  
volume-  and revenue-related expense .  
The provision for credit losses was  a net benefit of $947 
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses, compared with an expense of $2.1 billion in the 
prior year.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its 
overall fund performance.
Effective September 2021, AWM changed the source for the peer 
group quartile rankings of its funds from Lipper to Morningstar for 
U.S.-domiciled funds (except for “Municipals” and “Investor” funds, 
for which the source remains Lipper) and Taiwan domiciled funds. 
AWM evaluates fund performance utilizing this peer group ranking 
and believes that it provides investors with comparability across the 
industry. This change resulted in both positive and negative impacts 
on the quartile rankings for prior periods, as compared to how they 
would have been ranked by Lipper. In addition, AWM has changed its 
selection of the “primary share class” for certain non-
U.S. funds, as set forth below, in order to establish a more consistent
approach across these products. Prior periods in the following table 
have been revised to conform to the current presentation.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds 
rated 4- or 5-star:  Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on 
their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating 
is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked 
funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide 
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and 
represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall 
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the 
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if 
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, 
separate star ratings are provided at the individual share
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-
adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of 
history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All 
ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to 
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating 
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate 
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star 
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a 
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other 
funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the 
fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds 
ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years) :All 
quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values 
used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating 
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute 
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers 
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is 
based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share 
class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong 
SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance 
data may have been different if all share classes had been included. 
Past performance is not indicative of future results.
“Primary share class ” means the C share class for European funds and 
Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share 
classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary 
share class.Selected metrics

Net revenue was a loss of $3.5 billion , compared with a loss

Net interest income decreased primarily driven by :
•limited opp ortunities to deploy funds in response to 
significant deposit growt h across the LOBs, and
•the impact of faster prepayments on mortgage-backed 
securities in the first half of 2021, 
partially offset by
•higher net interest income on growth in investment 
securities.
Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due t o:
•net investment securities losses related to repositioning 
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net 
gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS ,
•lower net valuation gains on several legacy equity 
investments
partially offset by
•the absence of losses recorded in the prior year in 
Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment 
transactions, which were more than offset by the related 
net interest income earned on these transactions, also in 
the prior year, and
•the absence of losses recorded in the prior year related to 
the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-term 
debt in Treasury and CIO
Noninterest expense of $1.8 billion  was up $429 million 
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm’s 
Foundation, investments related to the Firm’s international 
consumer expansion,  technology initiatives, and higher 
legal expense, largely offset by the absence of an 
impairment on a legacy investment recorded in the prior 
year.
Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on 
the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for

The current period income tax benefit was  driven by 
changes in the level and mix of income and expenses 
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes as well as 
other tax adjustments, partially offset by the resolutions of 
certain tax audits.

Treasury and  CIO overview 
Treasury and CIO  is predominantly responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s 
liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and 
foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and 
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four 
major reportable business segments to serve their 
respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-
balance sheet assets and liabilities.
Treasury and CIO seek to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability 
management objectives generally by investing in high-
quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as 
part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury 
and CIO also use derivatives to meet the Firm ’s asset-
liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further 
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO 
manage the Firm’s cash position primarily through deposits 
at central banks and investments in short-term instruments. 
Refer to Liq uidity Risk Management on pages 97-104  for 
further information on liquidity and funding risk . Refer to  
Market Risk Management on pages 133-140  for 
informatio n on interest rate, foreign exchange and other 
risks.
The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists 
of U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency 
mortgage-backed securities, U.S. and non-U.S. government 
securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities, 
other ABS and corporate debt securities. At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021 , the Treasury and CIO invest ment securities portfolio, 
net of allowance for credit losses, was $670.1 billion , and 
the average credit rating of the securities comprising the

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale  
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm.  
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things:  
•Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;  
•Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; 
and  
•Firmwide structures for risk governance.  
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Bo ard of Directors (the 
“ B o a r d ” ) .   T h e  i m p a c t  o f  r i s k  a n d  c o n t r o l  i s s u e s  i s  c a r e f u l l y  
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes.  
Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.  
Drivers of Risks  are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers 
of risks include the economic environment, regulatory and 
government policy , competitor and market evol ution, 
business decisions, process and judgment error, deliberate 
wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters .
Types of Risks are categories by which risks manifest 
themselves. Risks are generally categorized in the following 
four risk types:  
•Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or inadequate response to changes in the 
operating environment.  
•Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and 
investment portfolio risk.  
•Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 
changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit 
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and 
liabilities held for both the short and long term.  
•Operational risk is  the risk associated with an adverse 
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems; human factors; or external events 
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems.  It includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model 
risk.
Impacts of Risks  are consequences of risks, both 
quantitative and qualitative. There may be many 
consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative 
impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, 
liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative 
impacts such as reputation damage, loss of clients and 
customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.
The Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is 
managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent 
Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which consists of the 
Risk Management and Compliance organizations. The Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by 
the Risk Committee of the Board (“Board Risk Committee”), 
the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM 
organization and manage the risk governance structure of 
the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board 
Risk Committee in the form of the Risk Governance and 
Oversight Policy. The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates 
authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), 
and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who each 
establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, 
set the Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and 
define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk 
governance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks that 
arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk areas that span 
across the individual LOBs, functions and regions. 
Three lines of defense
The Firm relies upon each  area  of the Firm giving rise to 
risk to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM 
function, and within its own management-identified risk and 
control standards. 
Each LOB and Treasury & CIO, including their aligned 
Operations, Technology and Control Management, are the 
Firm’s “first line of defense” and own the identification of 
risks, as well as the design and execution of controls to 
manage those risks. The first line of defense is responsible 
for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and 
for the implementation of the risk management structure 
(which may include policy, standards, limits, thresholds and 
controls) established by IRM.  
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 81
The IRM function is independent of the businesses and is 
the Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM function  
independently assesses and challenges the first line of 
defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible 
for its own adherence to applicable laws, rules and 
regulations and for the implementation of policies and 
standards established by IRM with respect to its own 
processes.  
Internal Audit is an independent function that provides 
objective assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk 
management as the “third line of defense.” The Internal 
Audit Function is headed by the General Auditor, who 
reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the 
CEO.  
In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the 
Firmwide control environment but are not considered part 
of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human 
Resources and Legal , and are responsible for adherence to 
applicable laws, rules and re gulations and policies and 
standards established by IRM with respect to their own 
processes.
Risk identification and ownership
Each LOB and Corporate owns the ongoing identification of 
risks, as well as the design and execution of controls, 
including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To 
support this activity, the Firm has a formal Risk 
Identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB 
and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks 
inherent to the Firm, catalog them in a central repository 
and review the most material risks on a regular basis. The 
IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and 
Corporate’s identified risks, maintains the central 
repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results 
to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and Board Risk 
Committee.  
Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk 
Appetite” framework s for quantitative and qualitative risks. 
Periodically the Firm’s risk appetite is set and approve d by 
senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and 
approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and 
qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the 
Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk 
appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board 
Risk Committee.  Management’s discussion and analysis
82 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues to 
senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 
The chart  below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the 
Firm’s risk governance structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and paths of escalation that support the 
oversight of risk which are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.
The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the 
Firm’s CEO, CRO, CFO, General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs 
and other senior executives, is accountable to and may 
refer matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The 
Operating Committee is responsible for escalating to the 
Board the information necessary to facilitate the Board’s 
exercise of its duties.
Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business 
and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s 
financial performance and condition and reviewing the 
strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries 
out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities 
through its  independen t, pri ncipal standing committees. 
The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that 
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the 
control environment, and the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee oversees compensation and other 
management-related matters. Each committee of the Board 
oversees reputational risks and conduct risks within its 
scope of responsibility.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is 
responsible for the oversight of management of the bank. 
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes this 
function acting directly and through the principal standing 
committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and 
control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is 
primarily the responsibility of the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to 
compensation and other management-related matters, the 
Compensation & Management Development Committee.
The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight 
of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk 
management framework reasonably designed to identify, 
assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk 
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable 
primary risk policies and review of certain associated 
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by 
management.   B r e a c h e s  i n  r i s k  a p p e t i t e  a n d  p a r a m e t e r s ,  
issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, 
including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant 
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk 
Committee, as appropriate.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of 
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an 
effective system of controls reasonably designed to 
safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the 
integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain 
compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans 
a n d  p r o c e d u r e s ,  a n d  w i t h  l a w s  a n d  r e g u l a t i o n s .   I t  a l s o

registered public accounting firm’s qualifications, 
independence and performance, and of the performance of 
the Firm’s Internal Audit function.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 83
The Compensation & Management Development Committee  
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s 
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews 
and approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified 
benefits programs. The Committee reviews the performance 
of Operating Committee members against their goals, and 
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s 
award is subject to ratification by the independent directors 
of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of 
and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s 
role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the 
“tone at the top”, the CMDC provides oversight of the Firm’s 
culture, including reviewing updates from management 
regarding significant conduct issues and any related actions 
with respect to employees, including compensation actions.
The Public Responsibility Committe e provides  oversight and 
review of the Firm's positions an d practices on public 
responsibility matters such as community investment, fair 
lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public 
policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character 
and could impact the Firm's reputation among its 
stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on 
these matters to management and the Board, as 
appropriate.
The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee  
exercises general oversight with respect to the governance 
of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of 
and recommends to the Board of Directors proposed 
nominees for election to the Board. The Committee 
evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate 
governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also 
appraises the framework for assessing the Board’s 
performance and self-evaluation. 
Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are 
primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:
The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”)  is the Firm’s highest 
management-level risk committee. It provides oversight of 
the risks inherent in the Firm’s businesses and serves as an 
escalation point for risk topics and issues raised by 
underlying committees and/or FRC members.
The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation 
committee for senior management to review and discuss 
the Firmwide operational risk environment including 
identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant 
events that have been escalated. 
Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are 
responsible for providing oversight of the governance, 
limits, and controls that are in place within the scope of 
their respective activities. These committees  review the 
ways in which the particular LOB or the business operating 
in a particular region could be exposed to adverse 
outcomes with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating 
and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these 
committees. Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees  
over see the operational risk and control environment of 
their respective business or function, inclusive of 
Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of 
that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators 
of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may 
impact the level of operating risk in a business or function, 
addressing key operational risk issues , with an emphasis on 
processes with control concerns and overseeing control 
remediation. 
The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for 
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management 
(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting  
the management of liquidity risk, balance sheet, interest 
rate risk, and capital risk. 
The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising 
from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. 
Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and 
oversight functions. The scope of a particular function may 
include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. 
For example, Country Risk Management oversees country 
risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of 
exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as 
credit or market risk. 
The following sections discuss the risk governance and 
oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in 
the Firm’s business activities.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or inadequate response to changes in the 
operating environment. 
Management and oversight
The Operating Committee and the senior leadership of each 
LOB and Corporate are responsible for managing the Firm’s 
most significant strategic risks. Strategic risks are overseen 
by IRM through participation in relevant business reviews, 
LOB and Corporate senior management meetings, risk and 
control committees and other relevant governance forums 
and ongoing discussions. The Board of Directors oversees 
management’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk 
Committee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk management 
framework.
In the process of developing business plans and strategic 
initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify 
the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide 
Risk Identification process and their impact on risk appetite. 
In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the 
LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their 
impact on the risk profile of the Firm. The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the 
development and execution of strategic initiatives, is one 
component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. Guided by 
the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”) , 
the Operating Committee and senior management teams in 
each LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic 
plan periodically. The process includes evaluating the high-
level strategic framework and performance against prior-
year initiatives, assessing the operating environment, 
refining existing strategies and developing new strategies.
These strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s assessment, are 
incorporated in the Firm’s budget and provided to the 
Board as part of its review and approval of the Firm’s 
s t r a t e g i c  p l a n .   
The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-
adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also 
a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to 
Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  for further 
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 97-104  for further information on 
liquidity risk. R efer to Reputation Risk Management on page 
105 for further information on reputation risk.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 85
 CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions.
A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business 
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong 
balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is 
considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of 
Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s 
fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted 
returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s 
capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining 
long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in 
market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed 
environments.  Senior management considers the 
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant 
decisions that could impact future business activities. In 
addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior 
management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with 
a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.
Capital management oversight
The Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function 
whose primary objective is to provide independent 
oversight of capital risk across the Firm.  
Capital Management Oversight’s responsibilities include:
•Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;
•Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk 
limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;
•Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 
capital limit breaches; 
•Performing an assessment of the Firm’s capital 
management activities, including changes made to the 
Contingency Capital Plan described below; and
•Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital 
framework intended to ensure compliance with 
applicable regulatory capital rules.
Capital management
Treasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.  
The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management 
are to:
•Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build 
and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle 
and in stressed environments;
•Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment 
opportunities;
•Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of 
strength to its subsidiaries;
•Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory 
capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” 
status for the Firm and its insured depository institution 
(“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable 
regulatory capital requirements;•Meet capital distribution objectives; and
•Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate 
throughout a resolution period in accordance with the 
Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
•Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and 
maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The 
internal minimum capital levels  consider the Firm’s 
regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal 
assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic 
cycles and in stress events ;
•Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of 
potential events; and
•Regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and 
following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the 
Firm and material legal entity levels.
Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital 
management include the Capital Governance Committee, 
the ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, and the CIO, 
Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the 
Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk 
Management on pages 81-84  for additional discussion on 
the ALCO and other risk-related committees.
Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding 
Companies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at least 
annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and 
approved by the Board of Directors.  The Federal Reserve 
uses CCAR and other stress testing processes to ensure that 
large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of 
economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-
looking capital assessment and planning processes in place 
that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb 
losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the 
Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and  
internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ ICAAP ”), 
as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as 
dividend payments or stock repurchases.  The Federal 
Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario 
from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s 
Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming 
year. 
On June 28, 2021, JPMorgan Chase announced that it had 
completed the 2021 CCAR stress test process. On August 5, 
2021, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2021 SCB 
requirement of 3.2% (down from 3.3%) and the Firm's 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement including 
regulatory buffers, of 11.2% (down from 11.3%). The 
2021 SCB requirement became effective on October 1, 
2021 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2022 .Management’s discussion and analysis

Refer to Capital actions on page 94  for information on 
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the 
Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s 
processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as 
well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital 
planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates 
stress testing protocols with capital planning . The Firm’s 
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the capital stress testing control framework.
Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings 
and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters 
underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and 
applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios 
are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which 
are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, 
which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and 
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are 
intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and 
idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and 
other periodic stress testing, management also considers 
tailored stress  scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as 
necessary.  
Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital 
management framework for the Firm and specifies the 
principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital 
management in normal economic conditions and during 
stress. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm 
calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum 
capital requirements, monitors the ongoing 
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets 
out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be 
taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion 
during a period of stress.
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated 
financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar 
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s 
IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The 
U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital 
Accord of the Basel Committee, a s amended from time to 
time.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S.  BHCs  and banks, including the 
Firm and its  IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A.  The minimum amount of regulatory capital that 
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by 
calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-
balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches 
are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based 
capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated 
against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced 
approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital 
ratio requirements . The Firm’s Basel III Standardized  risk-
based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III 
Advanced  risk-based ratios. 
Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating 
credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of 
Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in 
the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized 
and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, 
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which 
largely rely on the use of internal credit models and 
parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk 
RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings 
which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. 
Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent 
basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.  
In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches,  
the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate 
management judgment and feedback from its regulators.  
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approach es banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding 
than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios . Refer to 
SLR on page 93  for additional information.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized. 
Key Regulatory Developments  
CECL regulatory capital transition.  The Firm elected to apply 
the CECL capital transition provisions as permitted by the 
federal banking agencies which delayed  the effects of CECL 
on regulatory capital for two years  until January 1, 2022, 
followed by a three-year transition period  (“CECL capital 
transition provisions”). 
As of December 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm 
reflected the benefit of the CECL capital transition 
provisions of $ 2 . 9   b i l l i o n, which will be phased in at 25% 
per year beginning January 1, 2022.
The CECL capital transition provisions have also been 
incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, 
and total leverage exposure and are also subject to the 
three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022 .
Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL 
accounting guidance.
Paycheck Protection Program . The federal banking agencies 
issued a  final rule in September 2020 to neutralize the 
regulatory capital effects of participating in the PPP on risk-
based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk weight 
to loans originated under the program.  The Firm does not 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 87
expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans 
because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. As of 
December 31, 2021, the Firm had $6.7 billion of loans 
remaining under the program. 
Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the 
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending 
Facility, which would have allowed the Firm to exclude them 
under the final rule.
TLAC Holdings rule.  On October 20, 2020, the federal 
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the 
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”) debt instruments by certain 
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expanded the scope of the prior 
capital deductions rule relating to the holdings of capital 
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC 
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking 
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021 
and did not have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based 
capital metrics.
Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk . In 
November 2019, the U.S. banking regulators adopted a rule 
implementing “Standardized Approach for Counterparty 
C r e d i t  R i s k ”  ( “ S A - C C R ” ) ,   w h i c h  r e p l a c e d  t h e  c u r r e n t  
exposure method used to measure derivatives counterparty 
exposure under Standardized approach RWA, as well as 
leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the 
regulatory capital framework. The rule applies to Basel III 
Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with a mandatory 
compliance date of January 1, 2022.
Based on the derivatives exposure as of December 31, 
2021, the adoption of SA-CCR is estimated to increase the 
Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion and 
result in a modest decrease in its total leverage 
exposure .   T h e s e  e s t i m a t e s  m a y  d i f f e r  f r o m  t h e  a c t u a l  
impact based on the composition of the Firm’s derivatives 
exposure as of March 31, 2022.Management’s discussion and analysis

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements 
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.
All banking institutions are currently required to have a 
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted 
assets.
Certain banking organizations, including  the Firm, are 
required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a 
“capital conservation buffer” . The capital conservation 
buffer incorporates  a global systemically important bank 
(“GSIB”) surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital 
buffer  and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5%  for 
Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a variable 
SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized 
regulatory capital requirements. Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required 
to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two 
separately prescribed methods based on data for the 
previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the 
two. “Method 1”, reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed 
by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is  
calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across 
five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
interconnectedness, c omplexity and substitutability. 
“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 
requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale 
funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB 
score “multiplication factor”. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 89
The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB 
surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 
2020. For 2022, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge under 
both Method 1 and Method 2 rem ains unchanged at 2.0% 
and 3.5%, respectively.
2022 2021 2020
Method 1  2.0 %  2.0 %  2.5 %
Method 2  3.5 %  3.5 %  3.5 %
On November 23, 2021, the FSB released its annual GSIB 
list based upon data as of December 31, 2020, which 
announced the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% 
(up from 2.0%) effective January 1, 2023, unless the 
Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge, as determined by the FSB, 
is lower based upon data as of December 31, 2021.
The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of 
December 31, 2020 is 4.0%, which will be effective 
January 1, 2023. The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge 
calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%. 
Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the 
Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 
4.5% on January 1, 2024 unless the Firm’s Method 2 GSIB 
surcharge calculation based upon data as of December 31, 
2022 is lower.
The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a 
framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital 
buffer taking into account the macro financial environment 
in which large, internationally active banks function. As of 
December 31, 2021, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer 
remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to 
review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be 
increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine 
that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can 
be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 
12-month implementation period.  
Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess 
of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the 
capital conservation buffer  (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) 
and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to 
the amount of capital that  the Firm may distribute,  such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as certain executive discretionary bonus payments.
The Firm believes that it will operate with a Basel III 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio between 12.0% and 13.0% 
in the near term, based on the Basel III capital rules 
currently in effect, and with consideration for an increase in 
the GSIB surcharge in 2023.  
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S.  GSIB  top-
tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term 
debt (“eligible LTD”).  Refer to TLAC on page 95  for 
additional information.Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced 
approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 
3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, 
are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage 
buffer.
The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided 
by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage 
exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average 
on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be 
deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance 
sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and 
derivatives potential future exposure.  
Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the 
regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the 
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.
Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of 
Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also 
maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be 
“well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the 
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) 
requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), 
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information. 
Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, 
as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to 
which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to

Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for 
expected returns are established as key measures of a 
business segment’s performance.  
The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III 
Stan dardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB 
surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress 
environment.  As of January 1, 2022, the Firm has changed 
its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of 
changes in RWA for each LOB and to reflect an increase in 
the Firm’s GSIB surcharge to 4.0% that will be effective 
January 1, 2023.  The assumptions and methodologies used 
to allocate capital are periodically reassessed and as a 
result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change from 
t i m e  t o  t i m e .

Common stock
On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced 
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share 
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. 
Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of 
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase 
program for up to $ 3 0   b i l l i o n. As directed by the Federal 
Reserve, total  net repurchases and common stock dividends 
in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and 
could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for 
the four preceding calendar quarters.
On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the 
temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire 
on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above 
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the 
2021 CCAR stress test.  Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm 
became subject to the normal capital distribution 
restrictions provided under the regulatory capital 
framework. The Firm continues to be authorized to 
repurchase common shares under its existing common 
share repurchase program previously approved by the 
Board of Directors.
Refer to capital planning and stress testing on pages 86-87  
for additional information.

(a)On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended 
repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve 
directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share 
repurchases through the end of 2020.The Board of Director’s authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and 
the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common 
shares that may be repurchased is subject to various 
factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into 
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital 
generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The 
repurchase program does not include specific price targets 
or timetables; may be suspended by management at any 
time; and may be executed through open market purchases 
or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 
10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm 
may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm 
to repurchase its common shares during periods when it 
may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for 
example, during internal trading blackout periods.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. 
Liquidity risk oversight
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Oversight function whose 
primary objective is to provide oversight of liquidity risk 
across the Firm.  Liquidity Risk Oversight’s responsibilities 
include:  
•Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;  
•Independently establishing and monitoring limits and 
indicators, including liquidity risk appetite;  
•Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 
limit breaches;  
•Performing an independent review of liquidity risk 
management processes;  
•Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal 
entity liquidity stress tests , regulatory defined metrics, 
as well as liquidity positions,  balance sheet variances 
and funding activities; and  
•Approving or escalating for review new or updated 
liquidity stress assumptions .
Liquidity management 
Treasury & CIO is responsible for liquidity management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management 
are to:  
•Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material 
legal entities are able to operate in support of client 
needs and meet contractual and contingent financial 
obligations through normal economic cycles as well as 
during stress events, and  
•Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of 
liquidity sources.  
The Firm addresses these objectives through:  
•Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics 
of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal 
entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and 
operational restrictions;  
•Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;  
•Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-
specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and 
contingency funding plans;  
•Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity 
risk appetite tolerances and limits;  
•Managing compliance with regulatory requirements 
related to funding and liquidity risk; and  
•Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity 
characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as 
well as certain off-balance sheet items.  As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, 
the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, 
global approach designed to:  
• Optimize liquidity sources and uses;  
• Monitor exposures;  
• Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between 
the Firm’s l egal entities; and 
• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at 
a Firmwide and legal entity level, where  relevant.  
Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the 
Firmwide ALCO  as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the 
Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and 
recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, 
the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and 
liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on  
pages 81-84  for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-
related committees.  
Internal stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm 
has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, 
including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution 
and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for  
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s 
material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress 
tests are performed in response to specific market events 
or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s 
contractual financial obligations are met and take into 
consideration:  
•Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured 
funding markets ; 
•Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash 
outflows ; and  
•Potential impediments to the availability and 
transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and 
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other 
restrictions.  
Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range 
of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate 
both market and idiosyncratic stresses.  
Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of 
the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity 
position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding 
for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, 
and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”) provides funding support to the 
ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent 
Company, IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient 
to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum 
liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 97
stress when access to normal funding sources may be 
disrupted.
Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the 
strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource 
needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates 
liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances. 
The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding 
and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal 
entities in a period of stress.  
Liquidity Coverage Ratio and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA  that is 
sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over 
a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress.   
Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the 
amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain 
operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA 
primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid 
securities as defined in the LCR rule.  
Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by  
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-
alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not 
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from 
the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.   
Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized 
stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, 
which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, 
sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum o f 100%.  The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, September 30, 2021 and

the three months ended December 31, 202 1, compared 
with both the three month periods ended September 30, 
2021 and December 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in 
deposits.  The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under 
the LCR rule.
The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR 
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity.  Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, 
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. 
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was 
approximately  $914 billion  and $740 billion  as of 
December 31, 202 1 and 2020 , respectively,  although the 
amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular 
time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.  
The fair value increased compared to D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
due to an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased 
deposits.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at  FHLBs 
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a 
result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately  $308 billion  and $307 billion  as of 
December 31, 202 1 and 2020 , respectively. This borrowing 
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities 
reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered 
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve 
Bank discount window and other central banks . Although 
available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at 
the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other 
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.
NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and 
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year 
horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies 
issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking 
organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. are required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% on 
an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule became effective on 
July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly 
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually 
beginning in 2023. 
As of December 31, 2021, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR,  
based on the Firm’s current understanding of the final rule.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 99
Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- 
and long-term cash requirements.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term 
secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from  the IHC. The 
Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from 
long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured 
borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by 
Treasury and CIO  in the Firm’s investment securities 
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid 
investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk 
characteristics.  
Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance 
sheet obligations.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity.  Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.  
Furthermore, certain deposits are covered by insurance 
protection that provides addition al fundin g stability  and 
results in a benefit to the LCR.  Deposit in surance protection 
may be available to depositors  in the countries in which the 
deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance 
protection for deposits placed in a U.S. Depository 
Institution . At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firmwide 
estimated u ninsured deposits were $1,489.6 billion  and 
$1,275.9 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting 
wholesale operating deposits .Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table 
below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. 
time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s 
estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on 
data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable 
FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non-
U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during 
periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.
Average deposits increased for the year ended 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, reflecting significant inflows across 
the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain 
government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from existing 
and new accounts across both consumer and small business 
customers.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.  
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased 
at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, compared with D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2020 , due to lower secured financing of AFS investment 
securities in Treasury and CIO, and trading assets in CIB 
Markets .
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding 
primarily consist of issuance s of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds.  The increase in 
commercial paper  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, from 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 was due to higher net issuance 
primarily for short-term liquidity management.
The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at 
December 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020, and for the 
average year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the 
prior year period, was primarily due to net issuances of 
structured notes.Management’s discussion and analysis
102 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan 
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including  TLAC. Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.  
The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in 
support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs.  The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding 
proceeds to its subsidiary,  the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties.  The following table summarizes 
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 . Refer to

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.
Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and 
credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional 
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on 
the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and 
collateral agreements.

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings 
or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable 
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, 
earnings, or stock price.Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a 
stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and 
liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management 
controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies 
continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, 
regulatory developments, future profitability, risk 
management practices, and litigation matters, as well as 
their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of 
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit 
ratings.Management’s discussion and analysis

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT
Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may 
negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and 
reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various 
constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, 
investors, regulators, employees, communities or the 
broader public.
Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management establishes the governance 
framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s 
LOBs and Corporate. As reputation risk is inherently 
challenging to identify, manage, and quantify, a reputation 
risk management function is particularly important.
The Firm’s reputation risk management function i ncludes 
the following activities:
• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance 
policy and standard consistent with the reputation risk 
framework 
• Overseeing the governance execution through 
processes and infrastructure that support consistent 
identification, escalation, management and monitoring 
of reputation risk issues Firmwide
The types of events that result in reputation risk are wide-
ranging and may be introduced by the Firm’s employees 
and the clients, customers and counterparties with which 
the Firm does business. These events could result in 
financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as 
other harm to the Firm. Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the 
principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is 
the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate 
to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding 
whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or 
client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a 
business process or consider any other activity. 
Sustainability, social responsibility and environmental 
impacts are important considerations in assessing the 
Firm’s reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s 
reputation risk governance.
Reputation risk issues deemed material  are escalated as 
appropriate.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, 
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The 
Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from 
large corporate and institutional clients to individual 
consumers and small businesses.  In its consumer 
businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily 
through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business 
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, 
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients 
and counterparties, as well as through its operating services 
activities (such as cash management and clearing 
activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is 
also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities 
portfolio and cash placed with banks.
Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages 
credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk 
policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management 
governance includes the following activities:
•Maintaining a credit risk policy framework
•Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across 
all portfolio segments, including transaction and 
exposure approval
•Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as 
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines 
•Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection 
with the approval of credit exposure
•Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and
•Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate 
credit risk-based capital managementRisk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several 
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or 
counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit 
risk vary depending on several factors, including type of 
asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement 
parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit 
score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management 
and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center 
versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk 
measurement is based on the probability of default of an 
obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default 
event and the exposure at default.
Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates 
described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit 
l o s s e s  f o r  i t s  e x p o s u r e s .   T h e  a l l o w a n c e  f o r  l o a n  l o s s e s  
reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and 
wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the 
allowance for lending-related commitments reflects 
estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related 
commitments  and the allowance for investment securities 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment

Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 150-153  
for further information.
In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are 
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and 
represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to 
the established allowances for loan losses and lending-
related commitments. The analyses for these losses include 
stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios 
as described below.
Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing 
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing 
process assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses 
for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying 
parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of 
macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. 
The stress test results may indicate credit migration, 
changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the 
credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing 
processes, management also considers additional stresses 
outside these scenarios, including industry and country- 
specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress 
testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a 
Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress 
on individual counterparties.Management’s discussion and analysis
106 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are 
designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the 
approval and decision-making process for extending credit 
to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved 
properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both 
the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework 
establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, 
risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and 
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In 
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in 
evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently 
validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.
Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and 
other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio 
level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through 
changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. 
Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and 
other trends against business expectations, current and 
forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. 
Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends 
are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer 
credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit 
risk profile of the portf olio. 
Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate 
portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty 
level with established concentration limits that are 
reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate 
by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as 
measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, 
are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk 
is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively 
correlated with the impact of a default by the same 
counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the 
same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its 
obligations is decreasing.
Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is 
accomplished through a number of means, including:
•Loan underwriting and credit approval processes
•Loan syndications and participations
•Loan sales and securitizations
•Credit derivatives
•Master netting agreements, and
•Collateral and other risk-reduction techniquesIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent 
Credit Review function is responsible for:  
•Independently validating or changing the risk grades 
assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit  
portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade 
changes initiated by responsible business units; and  
•Evaluating the effectiveness of  the credit management 
processes of the LOBs  and Corporate, in cluding the 
adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/ loss given 
default (“ LGD”)  rationales, proper monitoring and 
management of credit exposures, and compliance with 
applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.  
Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and 
wholesale loans.
Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-
making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, 
concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported 
regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. 
Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, 
counterparties and customers, product and geography are 
prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on 
a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and 
governance structure, credit risk trends and limit 
exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, 
risk committees, senior management and the Board of 
Directors.

Customer and client assistance
The Firm  provided various forms of assistance to customers 
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including 
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The 
majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications 
have not been considered troubled debt restructurings 
(“TDRs”). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, 
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers 
and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due 
or nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on 
pages 110-116  and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 
117-128  for information on loan modifications as of 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for further 
information on the Firm’s accounting policies for loan 
modifications and the allowance for credit losses.
Paycheck Protection Program
The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented by 
the SBA, provided the Firm with delegated authority to 
process and originate PPP loans. When certain criteria are 
met, PPP loans are subject to forgiveness and the Firm will 
receive payment of the forgiveness amount from the SBA. 
PPP loans have a contractual term of two or five years and 
provide borrowers with an automatic payment deferral of 
principal and interest.  The SBA will pay accrued interest 
through the payment deferral period and additional interest 
up to a maximum of 120 days past due.  Based upon these 
servicing guidelines, the Firm continues to accrue interest 
for PPP loans 90 or more days past due until delinquency 
reaches 120 days past due. PPP processing fees are 
deferred and accreted into interest income over the 
contractual life of the loans, but may be accelerated upon 
forgiveness or prepayment.
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , the Firm had $6.7 billion 
and $27.2 billion, respectively, of PPP loan s, including $5.4 
billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, in consumer, and 
$1.3 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, in wholesale. The 
PPP ended for new applications on May 31, 2021. 
As of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, approximately $34 bi llion of 
PPP loans have been repaid through payments of 
forgiveness amounts to the Firm from the SBA. During the 
year ended December 31, 2021, this resulted in 
accelerated recognition in interest income of the associated 
deferred processing fees, primarily in CCB .
At December 31, 20 21, $633 million of PPP loans 90 or 
more days past due have b een excluded from the Firm’s 
nonaccrual loans as they are guaranteed by the SBA .
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66  and Note 12 
for a further discussion of the PPP.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO
The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of 
residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto 
and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-
related commitments.  The Firm’s focus is on serving 
primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. 
Originated mortgage loans are retained in the residential 
real estate portfolio, securitized or sold to U.S. government 
agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other 
types of consum er loans are typically retained on the 
balance sheet.  The credit performance of the consumer 
portfolio, including net charge-offs continued to benefit from 
the improvement in the macroeconomic environment during 
2021.  Refer to Note 12 for further information on the 
consumer loan portfolio. Refer to Note 28 for further

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to 
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals.
As of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020, the Firm had 
approximately $ 1.3 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively, of 
retained consumer loans under payment deferral programs, 
predominantly in residential real estate, compared to 
approximately $28.3 billion at June 30, 2020.  During the 
fourth quarter of 2021, there were approximately $386 
million of new enrollments in consumer payment deferral 
programs.  Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment 
deferral programs are current . The Firm continues to 
monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to 
payment deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an 
ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume 
making regularly scheduled payments, and considers 
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these 
loans in its allowance for credit losses.Of the $1.3 billion of retained loans under payment deferral 
programs as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, approximately $611 
million were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral 
and approximately $40 million were accounted for as TDRs 
because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not elect to 
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided 
by the CARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act and which expired on January 1, 2022. 
Borrowers that are unable to resume or continue making 
payments in accordance with the original or modified 
contractual terms of their agreements upon exit from 
deferral programs will be placed on nonaccrual status in line 
with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit cards as 
permitted by regulatory guidance, and the loans charged off 
or down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 driven by higher 
residential real estate loans  at fair value, largely offset by 
lower auto and other loans.
The following discussions provide information concerning 
individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit 
quality indicators.
Residential real estate:  The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit. 
Retained loans were relatively flat compared to 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 as the decline in Home Lending driven 
by paydowns outpacing originations of prime mortgage 
loans was predominantly offset by growth in AWM. Retained 
nonaccrual loans decreased from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 
reflecting improved credit performance . Net recoveries for 
the year ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 were higher when 
compared with the prior year as the current year benefited 
from further improvement in HPI and higher reversals of 
prior write-downs due to prepayments as a result of the low 
rate environment.
Loans at fair value increased from  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0, 
reflecting loan purchase activity in CIB driven by higher 
client demand, as well as increased originations in Home 
Lending due to the continued low rate environment. 
Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 due to sales in CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $18.7 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. This 
amount included $6.2 billion  of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $6.0 billion  of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile. 
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , the carrying value of 
interest-only residential mortgage loans were $30.0 billion  
and $25.6 billion , respectively. These loans have an 
interest-only payment period generally followed by an 
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. T he interest-only residential mortgage loan 
portfolio reflected net recoveries for the year ended 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, in line with the performance of the 
broader prime mortgage portfolio.The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure 
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related 
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other : The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as 
well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared 
with D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 due to a decrease in business 
banking loans largely offset by growth in the scored auto 
portfolio.  Business Banking loans declined predominantly 
due to PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by originations.  
The increase in the scored auto portfolio was driven by loan 
originations predominantly offset by paydowns. Net charge-
offs for the year ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 decreased 
when compared to the prior year driven by lower scored 
auto charge-offs as the current y ear benefited from  higher 
vehicle collateral values and elevated consumer cash 
balances, partially offset by higher overdraft charge-offs.

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 
reflecting strong sales volume predominantly offset  by 
higher payments. T he D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 30+ and 90+ 
day delinquency rates of 1.04%  and 0.50% , respectively, 
decreased compared to the D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68%  and 0.92% , 
respectively. The delinquency rates continue to benefit from 
the ongoing impact of government stimulus and support 
provided to borrowers who participated in payment 
assistance programs.  Net charge-offs decreased for the 
year ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 compared with the prior 
year reflecting lower charge-offs and higher recoveries as 
consumer cash balances remained elevated.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 119-123  for further information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated 
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto 
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is 
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.
In 2021  the credit environment continued to improve 
following the broad-based deterioration during the earlier 
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, retained loans increased 
$ 4 5 . 4   b i l l i o n driven by CIB and AWM, partially offset by 
decrease s in CCB. Lendin g-related commitments increased 
$ 3 6 . 6   b i l l i o n, predominantly driven by net portfolio activity 
in CB and CIB, including an increase in held for sale 
commitments intended to be syndicated.
As of December 31, 2021 , the investment-grade 
percentage of the portfolio remained relatively flat at 71% , 
while criticized exposure decreased $3.4 billion from $41.6 
billion  to $38.2 billion . The decrease in criticized exposure 
was driven by net portfolio activity and client- specific  
upgrades, primarily in Oil & Gas and Automotive, largely 
offset by client-specific downgrades. Nonperforming 
exposure decreased $ 1.2 billion driven by lower 
nonperforming loans, primarily in Oil & Gas and Individuals 
and Individual Entities, with net portfolio activity and client-
specific upgra des partially offset by client-specific 
downgrades. The decrease in nonperforming loans was 
partially offset by increases in derivatives an d lending-
related commitments.Wholesale credit portfolio

Wholesale assistance  
In March 2020, the Firm  began providing assistance  to 
clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals and 
covenant modifications.
As of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020,  the Firm had 
approximately $ 107 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, 
of retained loans under payment deferral programs, 
compared to $16.8 billion at June 30, 2020. Predominantly 
all clients that exited deferral are current or have paid 
down their loans . The Firm continues to monitor the credit 
risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout 
the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the 
borrowers are required to resume making regularly 
scheduled payments, and considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its 
allowance for credit losses.
In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of 
covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both 
payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are 
generally not reported as TDRs, either because the 
modifications were insignificant or they qualified to 
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option 
provided by the CARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act and which expired on January 1, 2022. 
Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in 
accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management 
framework. As of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, substantially all of 
these loans were considered performing.
Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 . The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to 
BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining 
the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of 
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.
Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking 
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist 
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-
for-sale and loans at fair value, was $38.2 billion  at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and $41.6 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2020 , representing approximately 3.5%  and 4.0%  of total 
wholesale credit exposure, respectively . The decrease in 
criticized exposure was driven by net portfolio activity and 
client-specific upgrades, primarily in Oil & Gas and 
Automotive, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. 
The $38.2 billion  of criticized exposure at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021  was largely undrawn and $35.0  billion was 
performing.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The 
contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of 
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is 
generally held against these receivables. To manage its 
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and 
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, 
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other 
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk 
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in 
interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and 
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives 
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to 
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions 
from its market-making activities, including the 
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. 
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own 
credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the 
counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the 
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. 
For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of 
the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded 
derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and 
cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the 
Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant 
CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit 
risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the 
use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and 
collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC 
derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — 
excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not 
typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — 
was approximately 88%  at both D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020 . Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the 
Firm’s use of collateral agreements. Refer to Note 5 for a 
further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties 
and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $57.1 billion  and $75.4 
billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively. The 
decrease was primarily driven by mark et movements and 
maturities of certain trades in CIB, partially offset by an 
increase in commodity derivatives. Derivative  receivables 
represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after 
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting 
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.
In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and 
may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s 
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the 
definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition 
of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. 
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other 
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not 
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but 
that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral 
amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net 
derivative receivables for the counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the  table s below, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net 
fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the 
potential future variability of that credit exposure. To 
capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, 
the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three 
measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, 
Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure 
(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and 
collateral benefits, where applicable.
Peak represents a conservative measure of potential 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a 
counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly 
equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the 
transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm 
for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior 
management reporting and derivatives exposure 
management.
DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a 
basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan 
exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential 
credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for 
aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and 
other credit risk.
Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the 
Firm’s derivative exposure, including the benefit of 
collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of 
the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for 
pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital 
and CVA, as further described below. 
The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables 
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of 
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a 
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the 
credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk 
management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit 
risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk management process for derivatives exposures takes into 
consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which 
is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a 
counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a 
default by the same counterparty, which could cause 
exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s 
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors 
may influence the nature and magnitude of these 
correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations 
are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with 
a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages 
exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit 
derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign 
exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.

c u r r e n t  d e r i v a t i v e s  p o r t f o l i o  o v e r  t h e  n e x t  1 0   y e a r s  a s

measures generally show that exposure will decline after

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.
Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management activities”). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below. 
The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to 
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from 
certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making 
businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in 
credit portfolio management activities.Credit derivatives and credit-related notes used in credit

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. 
GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with 
gains and losses recognized in principal transactions 
revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related 
commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an 
accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, 
between loans and lending-related commitments and the 
credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not 
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in 
value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.
The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge 
against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a 
number of factors, including the named reference entity 
(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures 
that are different than the named reference entities in the 
purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which 
may have a defined credit event that does not align with an 
actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the 
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter 
than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally 
seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date 
that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the 
exposure for which the protection was purchased, and 
remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored 
and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in 
Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and 
derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.Management’s discussion and analysis

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses comprises:
•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,
•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and
•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is  recognized within Investment Securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
was $18.7  billion , a decrease from  $30.8  billion at  
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The decrease in the allowance for 
credit losses was primarily driven by improvements in the 
macroeconomic environment, consisting of:
•a $9.5 billion  reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio; and 
•a $2.6 billion  net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs.
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the 
Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse 
and upside scenarios compared to the significant weighting 
that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of 
December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained improvement 
and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite 
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, 
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic 
caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used 
for modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues to 
place reliance on management judgment and make 
adjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser 
extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit losses of 
$ 1 8 . 7   b i l l i o n reflects remaining uncertainties, including the 
potential impact that additional waves or variants of 
COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and 
near-term supply chain disruptions.The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO  predominantly  consists 
of high-quality securities. At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $670.1 billion , and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available, and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 79-80  and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 133-140  for 
further information on the market risk inherent in the 
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
97-104  for further information on related liquidity risk. 
Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk 
Committee with regular updates to the Board Risk 
Committee. 
The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. 
Approved levels for investment securities are established 
for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.Principal investment risk 
Principal investments are typic ally privately-held  financial 
instruments representing ownership interests or other 
forms of junior capital.  In general,  principal investments 
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to 
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and 
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance 
sheets.  These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy.  The 
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and 
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial 
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evo lve in 
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to 
support underserved communities and minority-owned 
businesses.  The aggregate carrying values of the principal 
investment portfolios have not been significantly affected 
by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent 
with the Firm’s risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk 
policy framework exists for all principal investing activities 
and includes approval by executives who are independent 
from the investing businesses, as appropriate. 
The Firm’s independent control functions  are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of 
the risk governance structure, approved levels for 
investments are established and monitored for each 
relevant business or segment in order to manage the 
overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress 
testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that 
estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or 
other risk events.Management’s discussion and analysis

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk  is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors  such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term.  
Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout 
the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. 
Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate 
efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating 
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s 
market risk profile for senior management, the Board of 
Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is 
responsible for the following functions:
•Maintaining a market risk policy framework
•Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling 
LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk
•Defining, approving and monitoring of limits
•Performing stress testing and qualitative risk 
assessments
Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk  
There is no single measure to capture market risk and 
therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, 
both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
•Value-at-risk (VaR) 
•Stress testing
•Profit and loss drawdowns 
•Earnings-at-risk 
•Other sensitivity-based measures
Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series 
of limits set in the context of the market environment and 
business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk 
Management takes into consideration factors such as 
market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client 
business, and management judgment. Market Risk 
Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level 
limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and 
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be 
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such 
as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within 
the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews 
and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is 
responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these 
risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been 
reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk 
Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs 
and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established 
limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.
Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely 
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk 
Management and senior management. In the event of a 
breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior 
members of appropriate groups within the Firm to 
determine the suitable course of action required to return 
the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a 
reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting 
a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected 
increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain 
Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as 
appropriate.
Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures 
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 149 .
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time.

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give 
rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate. 
In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities. To the 
extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk measures and captured in the 
table below. Refer to Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 132  for additional discussion on principal investments.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure , to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment.  The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.
The framework is employed across the Firm using historical 
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The 
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in 
market values are representative of the distribution of 
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm 
believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily 
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management 
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with 
other market risk measures, provides the appropriate 
information needed to respond to risk events.  
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.  
Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to 
measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across 
product types and is used for aggregating risks and 
monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are 
reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and 
regulators.  
Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual 
VaR models that simulate historical market returns for 
individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture 
material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management 
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are 
performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to 
market risk. These VaR models are granular and 
incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate 
daily changes in market values over the historical period; 
inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each 
portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to 
generate daily market values may be different across 
product types or risk management systems. The VaR model 
results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm 
level.
As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect 
measure of market risk exposure and potential future 
losses.  In addition, based on their reliance on available 
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, 
VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to 
measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly 
those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or 
severe shifts in market conditions.  
For certain products, specific risk parameters are not 
captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability 
of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to 
estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily 
time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual 
price-based time series for these products, if available, 
would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore 
considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its 
market risk positions.  
The daily market data used in VaR models may be different 
than the independent third-party data collected for VCG 
price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, 
in cases where market prices are not observable, or where 
proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data 
sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for 
further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR 
model calculations require daily data and a consistent 
source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data 
collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR 
model calculations. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
149 for information regarding model reviews and 
approvals.
The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in 
accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which 
is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital 
requirements under Basel III  capital rules . This Regulatory 
VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day 
holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which 
approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is 
applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel  III capital 
rules , which may be different than the positions included in 
the Firm’s Risk Management VaR . For example, credit 
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s 
Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these 
credit derivative hedges.  In addition, in contrast to the 
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently 
excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.
Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory 
VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory 
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed 
VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).

(a)Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 
of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.
(b)Average and maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR were primarily driven by a private equity position that became publicly traded at the end of the third 
quarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021 the Firm no longer held this position.
(c)The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification 
benefit is not meaningful.
Generally, average VaR across risk types and LOBs was 
lower due to volatility which occurred at the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic rolling out of the one-year historical 
look-back period, predominantly impacting exposures in 
fixed income and commodities. As a result, average Total 
VaR decreased by $40 million  for the year ended 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 when compared with the prior year.
In the current year, maximum VaR remained elevated 
relative to average VaR as the aforementioned volatility 
was still included in the historical look-back period in the 
first quarter of 2021.Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to 
exclude certain real estate-related fair value option elected 
loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based 
measures to more effectively measure the risk from these 
loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total 
VaR and each of the components would have been higher

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which 
compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the 
daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting 
purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below 
do not reflect the Firm’s  reported revenue as they exclude 
select components of total net revenue, such as those 
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., 
intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk 
management activities), fees, commissions, certain 
valuation adjustments and net interest income.  These 
excluded components of total net revenue may more than 
offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day.  The 
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is 
consistent with the requirements for backtesting under 
Basel III capital rules.
A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting 
loss exceeds the daily  Risk Management VaR for the prior 
day. Under the Firm’s  Risk Management VaR methodology, 
assuming current changes in market values are consistent 
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm 
would expect to  incur VaR backtesting exceptions on average five times every 100 trading days . The number of 
VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the 
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if 
the current level of market volatility is materially different 
from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of 
historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm 
posted backtesting gains on 145 of the 260 days, and 
observed 20 VaR backtesting exceptions. Twelve of the 
backtesting exceptions were in the three months ended 
December 31, 2021 as market volatility, particularly 
related to interest rates, was materially higher than the 
market volatility  in the 12 months of historical data used 
for the VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days can 
differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets 
and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB 
Markets revenue, as the population of positions which 
compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion 
of select components of total net revenue in backtesting 
gains and losses as described above. For more information 
on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71 .
The following chart  presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for  the trailing 12 months  and 
three months ended  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding 
daily  Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point 
intervals.  Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent.  The results in 
the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’ s Basel III Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on  Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Other risk measures 
Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to 
assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market 
behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from 
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive 
positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures 
the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed 
but possible economic and market scenarios. The results 
are used to understand the exposures responsible for those 
potential losses and are measured against limits.  
The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive 
positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used 
to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both 
market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant 
changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity 
prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, 
and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of 
hypothetical economic and market scenarios.  
The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail 
events in specific asset classes and geographies, including 
how the event may impact multiple market factors 
simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific 
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different 
products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the 
Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes 
against possible future stress events. Stress testing results 
are reported periodically to senior management of the 
Firm, as appropriate.  
Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress 
framework, under the oversight of Market Risk 
Management, and the models to calculate the stress results 
are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress 
Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to 
stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. 
Significant changes to the framework are escalated to 
senior management, as appropriate.  
The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating  
the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are 
reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, 
stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the 
Board Risk Committee.  
Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading 
losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and 
loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date 
peak level.
Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, 
issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio.  Refer 
to the table on page 134  for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk .
The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural 
interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject 
to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, 
working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s 
structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with 
senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee.  In 
addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is 
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the 
CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing 
independent oversight and governance around assumptions 
and establishing and monitoring limits for structural 
interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate 
risk generally through its investment securities portfolio 
and interest rate derivatives.
Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of 
factors, including:
•Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of 
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments
•Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-
balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing 
at the same time
•Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-
term market interest rates change (for example, changes 
in the slope of the yield curve)
•The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, 
liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest 
rates change
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its 
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. 
Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury 
and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into 
account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be 
risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include 
asset and liability balances and contractual rates of 
interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected 
prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and 
maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest 
rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.
One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk 
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-Management’s discussion and analysis
138 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures  as described on page 
134. 
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions.  These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including:  
•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.  
•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but  exclude 
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the 
Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such 
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience. 
Deposit forecasts  used in the baseline and scenarios do 
not include assumptions to account for the reversal of 
Quantitative Easing .   
•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 
betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates . The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ 
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and 
other factors.  
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors.  While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings -at-risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income 
(Refer to Outlook on page 49  for additional information) .The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or 
future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and 
revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which  the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.
Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that assesses, manages and monitors 
exposure to country risk across the Firm. 
The Firm’s country risk management function includes the 
following activities:
•Maintaining policies, procedures and standards 
consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework
•Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and 
establishing risk tolerance relative to a country
•Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and 
stress across the Firm
•Managing and approving country limits and reporting 
trends and limit breaches to senior management
•Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models 
and ratings indicators, for early identification of 
potential country risk concerns
•Providing country risk scenario analysis
Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and 
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether 
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes 
activity with both government and private-sector entities in 
a country. 
Under the Firm’s internal country risk management 
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is 
based on the country where the largest proportion of the 
assets of the  counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are 
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is 
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal 
residence) or country of incorporation. 
Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the 
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of 
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors 
attributed to that country. Activities which result in 
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not 
included in the country exposure measure (for exa mple, 
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to 
collateral on securities financing receivables).
Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the 
measurement and allocation of country exposure, 
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index 
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual country. The use of different measurement 
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of 
reported country exposure.
Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:
•Lending exposures are measured at the total committed 
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for 
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities 
collateral received
•Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with 
central and commercial banks
•Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
•Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value 
of all positions, including both long and short positions
•Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received
•Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold is 
reported based on the underlying reference entity and is 
measured at the notional amount of protection 
purchased or sold, net of the fair value of the recognized 
derivative receivable or payable. Credit derivatives 
protection purchased and sold in the Firm’s market-
making activities is measured on a net basis, as such 
activities often result in selling and purchasing 
protection related to the same underlying reference 
entity; this reflects the manner in which the Firm 
manages these exposures
The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the 
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory 
requirements. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 141
Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s 
country risk management framework, which aims to 
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by 
measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to 
a country based on market shocks combined with 
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk 
Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress 
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or  
sets of countries in response to specific or potential market 
events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and 
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to  
inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as 
necessary.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries. 
Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported 
regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify 
trends, and monitor high usages and breaches against 
limits.  
For country risk management purposes, the Firm may 
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully 
autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions 
(“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the 
independent sovereign states with which they are 
associated.
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, and 
their comparative exposures as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluct uate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows . 
The decrease in exposure to Germany and the increase in 
exposure to the United Kingdom were primarily due to 
changes in cash placements with the central banks of those 
countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity 
management activities in the fourth quarter of 2021 .
The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased  
cash placements with the central bank of Australia, largely 
driven by client activity following monetary policy decisions 
in the country and growth in client deposits .Top 20 country exposures (excluding the U.S.)(a)

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business disruptions (including those caused by 
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control)  cyber 
attacks , inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply 
with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of 
vendors or other third party providers to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates.  
Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk 
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable 
the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, 
manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk. 
Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
management of operational risk. The Control Management 
Organization, which consists of control managers within 
each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day 
execution of the CCOR Framework and the evaluation of the 
effectiveness of their control environments to determine 
where targeted remediation efforts may be required. 
The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE 
for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is 
responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework 
and establish ing minimum standards for its exec ution. The 
LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the 
Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative 
Risk Appetite and are independent of  the respective 
businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR 
Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance 
and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the 
Board Risk Committee periodically.
Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-
assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and 
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate 
evaluate the effectiveness of their control environment to 
assess where controls have failed, and to determine where 
remediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s 
Operational Risk and Compliance organization 
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of 
and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform 
independent assessments of significant operational risk 
events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent 
assessment of the operational risks inherent within the 
LOBs  and Corporate, which includes evaluating the 
effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the 
results to senior management.
In addition, O perational Risk and Compliance assesses 
operational risks through quantitative means, including 
operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational 
risk losses  unde r both baseline and stressed conditions.  
The primary component of the operational risk capital 
estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) 
statistical model, which simulates the frequency and 
severity of future operational risk loss projections based on 
historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an 
aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time 
horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model 
incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the 
quarter following the period in which those losses were 
realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect 
such losses even after the issues or business activities 
giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.
As required under the Basel III capital framework, the 
Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which 
uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), 
incorporates internal and external losses as well as 
management’s view of tail risk captured through 
operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key 
business environment and internal control metrics. The 
Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA 
estimate of operational risk capital. 
The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic 
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a 
forward looking view of material operational risk events 
that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s 
operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in 
calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress 
testing processes.  
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96  for 
information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.
Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by Operational 
Risk and Compliance are leveraged as one of the key 
criteria in the independent monitoring and testing of the 
LOBs and Corporate’s compliance with laws, rules and 
regulation. Through monitoring and testing, Ope rational 
Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of 
heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of 
controls within the LOBs and Corporate. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 143
Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through 
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and 
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as 
needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and 
Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the 
development and implementation of action plans.
Operational Risk Reporting
Escalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for 
employees at the Firm. Risks identified by Operational Risk 
and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and 
Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk 
and Compliance has established standards to ensure that 
consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk 
reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the 
L O B s  a n d  C o r p o r a t e .   R e p o r t i n g  i n c l u d e s  t h e  e v a l u a t i o n  o f  
key risk and performance indicators against established 
thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of 
operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards 
reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to 
the Board of Directors.
Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes . Refer to pages 146, 147, 148 and 149, 
respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, 
Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other 
select examples of operational risks are provided below.
Cybersecurity risk 
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure to harm 
or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by 
malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is an important and 
continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant 
resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the 
security of computer systems, software, networks, storage 
devices, and other technology assets. The Firm’s security 
efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, 
cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to 
obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, 
disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other 
damage. 
Ongoing business expansions may expose the Firm to 
potential new threats as well as expanded regulatory 
scrutiny including the introduction of new cybersecurity 
requirements. The Firm continues to make significant 
investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and 
to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate 
government and law enforcement agencies and other 
businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of 
cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance 
defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity 
threats. T he Firm actively participates in discussions  and 
simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry 
groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate 
employees and certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity 
risks .
Third  parties with which the Firm does business or that 
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply 
chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and 
financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity 
risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as 
system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the 
employees of such parties, or cyberattacks, including 
ransomware and supply-chain compromises could affect 
their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or 
result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its 
clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the 
Firm and it s information assets , particularly when their 
activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security 
and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in 
regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and 
clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to 
improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents 
occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of 
their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for 
losses incurred. 
To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the 
Firm maintains a cybersecurity program designed to 
p r e v e n t ,  d e t e c t ,  a n d  r e s p o n d  t o  c y b e r a t t a c k s .   T h e  A u d i t  
Committee is periodically provided with updates on the 
Firm’s Information Security Program, recommended 
changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing 
efforts to improve security, as well as its efforts regarding 
significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a 
cybersecurity incident response plan (“IRP”) designed to 
enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity 
incidents, coordinate such responses with law enforcement 
and other government agencies, and notify clients and 
customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the 
IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading 
connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various 
escalation points. 
Due to the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic, the Firm 
increased the use of remote access and video conferencing 
solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote 
work. As a result the Firm deployed additional 
precautionary measures and controls to mitigate 
cybersecurity risks and those measures and controls  remain 
in place .
The Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are 
responsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s 
Information Security Program. In partnership with the 
Firm’s LOBs and Corporate, the Cybersecurity and 
Technology Control organization identifies information 
security risk issues and oversees programs for the 
technological protection of the Firm’s information resources 
including applications, infrastructure as well as confidential Management’s discussion and analysis
144 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
and personal information related to the Firm’s employees 
and customers. The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls 
organization consists of business aligned information 
security managers that are supported within the 
organization by the following products that execute the 
Information Security Program for the Firm:
•Cyber Operations
•Identity & Access Management
•Governance, Risk & Controls
•Global Technology Product Security 
The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control 
governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and 
mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key 
governance forums to disseminate information and monitor 
technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple 
levels throughout the Firm and include representatives 
from each LOB and Corporate. The forums are used to 
escalate information security risks or other matters as 
appropriate. 
The IRM function provides oversight of the activities 
designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate 
cybersecurity risk. 
The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training 
that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and 
Security Management policies, standards and practices, as 
well as the expectation that employees comply with these 
policies. The Security Awareness Program engages 
personnel through training on how to identify potential 
cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and 
information. This training is mandatory for all employees 
globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by 
Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing 
tests. The Firm provide s specialized security training for 
certain employee roles such as application developers.  
Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all 
employees to take periodic awareness training on data 
privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information 
about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to 
unauthorized access to or use of information.Business and technology resiliency risk 
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s 
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics , severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, 
cyberat tacks and, te rrorism. The Firmwide Business 
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to 
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business 
disruptions including occurrence of  an extraordinary  event 
beyond its control that may impact critical business 
functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, 
facilities and third parties). The program includes 
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of 
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical 
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business 
interruption and public safety risks.
Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal 
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit 
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The 
risk of payment fraud normalized in 2021 since the 
heightened levels experienced d uring  earlier stages of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The  Firm continues to employ various 
controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as 
providing employee and client education and awareness 
trainings.
Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates 
Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and 
Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, 
monitoring and managing their supplier relationships 
including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of 
the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third 
parties to a high level of operational performance and to 
mitigate key risks, including data loss and business 
disruptions .   T h e  C o r p o r a t e Third-Party Oversight group

and standards.
Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated 
is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm 
purchases insurance from commercial insurers and 
maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance 
Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties 
with whom the Firm does business.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 145
COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT
Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the 
risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or 
codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory 
organizations. 
Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of 
and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The 
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization 
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is independent 
of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, 
monitoring and oversight of business operations with a 
focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations 
applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and 
services to clients and customers.
These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, 
rules and regulations  varying acro ss the LOBs a nd 
Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to 
financial products and services, relationships and 
interactions with clients and customers, and employee 
activities. For example, compliance risks include those 
associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading 
activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws, 
rules, and regulations related to the offering of products 
and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk 
is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including 
the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care (such 
as the duties of loyalty or care), to act in the best interest of 
clients and customers or to treat clients and customers 
fairly.
Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory 
obligations that are specific to their respective areas of 
responsibility.
Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and 
standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor 
and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global 
CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk 
Appetite.
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR 
Risk Management Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and 
FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also 
provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee and 
the Audit Committee. In c ertain cases, Special Purpose 
Committees of the Board may be established to oversee the 
Firm’s compliance with regulatory Consent Orders. 
Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth 
the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct 
themselves with integrity at all times and provides the 
principles that govern employee conduct with clients, 
customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with 
the markets and communities in which the Firm does 
business. The Code requires employees to promptly report 
any potential or actual violation of the Code, any internal 
Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the 
Firm’s business. It also requires employees to report any 
illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying 
principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, 
clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business 
partners, or agents. Code training is assigned to newly hired 
employees upon joining the Firm, and to current employees 
periodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to 
affirm their compliance with the Code at least annuall y. 
Employees can report any potential or actual violations of 
the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline by phone or 
the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain 
non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous 
reporting, and is available at all times globally, with 
translation services. It is administered by an outside service 
provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who 
raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the 
Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct 
program.Management’s discussion and analysis

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT
Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk 
that any action or inaction by an employee or employees 
could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact 
the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or 
compromise the Firm’s reputation.
Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and 
managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate 
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture 
consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles 
(the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how 
employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the 
Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the 
Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides 
information and resources to help e mployees conduct 
business ethically and in compliance with the laws 
everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk 
Management on page 146  for further discussion of the 
Code.
Governance and oversight
The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR 
Management policy, which establishes the framework for 
governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and 
testing, management and reporting conduct ris k in the 
Firm.The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the 
Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of 
conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm 
in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of 
focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program 
direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's 
employee conduct framework and reviewing the 
consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.
Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of 
people management practices throughout the employee life 
cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and 
development, performance management, promotion and 
c o m p e n s a t i o n  p r o c e s s e s .   E a c h  L O B ,  T r e a s u r y  a n d  C I O ,  a n d  
each designated corporate function completes an 
assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics 
and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides 
conduc t education as appropriate.

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of 
loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to 
meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in 
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with 
clients and customers, and products and services offered by 
the Firm.

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.  
The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing,  
evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making 
business decisions. A dedicated independent function, 
Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and 
governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of 
model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and 
judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk 
management, budget forecasting and capital planning and 
analysis. 
The governance of analytical and judgment-based 
estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent 
approach  which is used for models, as described in detail 
below.  
Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the 
Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users 
and developers of models are responsible for developing, 
implementing and testing their models, as well as referring 
models to the MRGR for review and approval. Once models 
have been approved, model users and developers are 
responsible for maintaining a robust operating 
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the 
performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model 
users and developers may seek to enhance models in 
response to changes in the portfolios and in product and 
market developments, as well as to capture improvements 
in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.  Models are tiered based on an internal standard according 
to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model 
and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject 
to the approval of the MRGR. In its review of a model, the 
MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the 
specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing 
a model, the MRGR analyzes and challenges the model 
methodology and the reasonableness of model 
assumptions, and may perform or require additional 
testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model 
reviews are approved by the appropriate level of 
management within the MRGR based on the relevant model 
tier.
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, the MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well 
as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In 
certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the 
Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. The MRGR may also require the user to take 
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be 
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.
While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly 
different from the historical macroeconomic environments 
upon which the m odels were trained, as the Firm 
experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 
pandemic. This uncertainty  may necessitate a greater 
degree of judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to 
model outputs than in typical periods.   
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 150-153  and Note 2 for a summary of model-based 
valuations and other valuation techniques.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 149
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorgan Chase ’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),
•The allowance for lending-related commitments, and
•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information 
on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and 
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across  
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily 
by a subset of less than twenty variables . The specific 
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled 
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.
•Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 
unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.•Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate 
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices  
and HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the 
Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse 
and upside scenarios compared to the significant weighting 
that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of 
December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained improvement 
and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite 
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, 
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic 
caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used 
for modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues to 
place reliance on management judgment and make 
adjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser 
extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit losses of 
$18.7 billion reflects remaining uncertainties, including the 
potential impact that additional waves or variants of 
COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and 
near-term supply chain disruptions.
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.  
For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 129 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. 
unemployment r ate, averaging approximately 2.8% higher 
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
approximately 4.4% in the second quarter of 2022; lower 
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly Management’s discussion and analysis
150 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
3.2% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a 
peak difference of approximately 6.5% in the second 
quarter of 2022; and lower national HPI with a peak 
difference of nearly 15.8% in the second quarter of 2023.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses as the impacts of 
changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, 
so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated 
for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. 
Additionally, expe ctation s of future changes in  portfolio 
composition and borrower behavior can  significantly  affect 
the allowance for credit losses.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the 
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative 
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without 
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other 
qualitative components of the  Firm’s allowance for credit 
losses,  the comparison between these two scenarios for th e 
lending exposures below reflect the following differences:
•An increase of approximately $550 million  for residential 
real estate loans and lending-related commitments
•An increase of approximately $2.6 billion  for credit card 
loans
•An increase of approximately $3.0 billion  for wholesale 
loans and lending-related commitments
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to  
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
Fair value 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives and structured note products. Certain assets and 
liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring 
basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other 
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of 
the underlying collateral.
Assets measured at fair value 
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value 
are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the 
application of judgment. The type and level of judgment 
required is largely dependent on the amount of observable 
market information available to the Firm. For instruments 
valued using internally developed valuation models and 
other valuation techniques that use significant 
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 151
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.
Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting 
units and tested for impairment at least annually. The 
Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill 
impairment testing is described in Note 15.
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing.
For the year ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the Firm reviewed 
current economic conditions, including the potential 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business 
performance, estimated market cost of equity, as well as 
actual business results and projections of business 
performance fo r its reporting units. T he Firm has concluded 
that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not 
impaired as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. For each of the 
reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value  by at 
least 10% and there was no indication of a significant risk 
of goodwill impairment based on current projections and 
valuations. 
The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent 
with management’s current business outlook assumptions 
in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long-
term growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where 
possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to 
benchmark its assumptions and estimates.Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit card s with various rewards 
programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points 
based on their account activity and the terms and 
conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no 
limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor 
do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a 
variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the 
form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm 
maintains a rewards liability which represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be 
redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the 
cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the 
cardholder redeems points. This liability was $9.8 billion  
and $7.7 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase 
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards 
points earne d on increased spend an d promotional offers 
outpacing redemptions throughout 2021, and to a lesser 
extent adjustments to redemption rate assumptions.
The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) 
and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption 
is used to estimate the number of points earned by 
customers that will be redeemed over the life of the 
account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of 
future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated 
periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder 
redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates 
to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, a combined increase of 25 basis 
points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the 
rewards liability by approximately $265 million .
Income taxes 
JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the 
various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. 
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions . These 
laws are often complex and may be subject to different 
interpretations. To determine the financial statement 
impact of accounting for income taxes, including the 
provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax 
benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and 
judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex 
tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as 
well as make judgments regarding the timing of when 
certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and 
non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the 
world are subject to review and examination by the various 
taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm 
operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a 
tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the 
various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, 
administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems  Management’s discussion and analysis
152 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. 
JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be 
assessed additional income taxes as a result of the 
resol ution of these matters, and the Firm records additional 
unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. I n addition, the 
Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes 
in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business 
strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate 
of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of 
operations in any reporting period.
Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and 
liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income 
tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, 
in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined 
to be more likely than not . Deferred taxes are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income 
in the years in which those temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred 
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the 
provision for income  taxes in the period enacted.
The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in 
connection with certain tax attributes, including net 
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit 
(“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews 
to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. 
These reviews include management’s estimates and 
assumptions regarding future taxable income , including 
foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax 
planning strategies, including strategies that may be 
available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In 
connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a 
deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is 
established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a 
subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, 
based on revised estimates of future taxable income or 
changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not 
that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become 
realizable. As of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, management has 
determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will 
realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation 
allowance.
The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary 
when new information becomes available, including 
changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with 
taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain 
tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit 
that management believes is more likely than not to be 
realized upon settlement. It is possible that the 
reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax 
benefits may h ave a material  impact on its effective income 
tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. 
Although the Firm believes that its estimates are 
reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the 
amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and 
accruals.  To the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such 
differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for 
income taxes in the period in which such a determination is 
made.
The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of 
current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax 
provisions are calculated based on estimates and 
assumptions that could differ from the actual results 
reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent 
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally 
recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and 
the global tax implications are known, whic h could impact 
the Firm’s effective tax rate.
Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income 
taxes.
Litigation reserves 
Refer to Note 30 for a description of the significant 
estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 155
Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“ JPMorgan Chase ” 
or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control over financial 
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s 
principal executive and principal financial officers, or 
persons performing similar functions, and effected by 
JPMorgan Chase ’s Board of Directors, management and 
other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
JPMorgan Chase ’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of JPMorgan Chase ’s management and directors; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has 
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021 . In making the assessment, management used the 
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) 
promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).Based upon the assessment performed, management 
concluded that as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, JPMorgan 
Chase ’s internal control over financial reporting was 
effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. 
Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the 
Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in 
its internal control over financial reporting as of 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, has been 
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent 
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report 
which appears herein.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.:
Opinions  on the Financial Statements and Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the 
“Firm”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, 
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 
“consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited 
the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Firm as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021  in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our 
opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
COSO. 
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Firm changed the manner in which it 
accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 
2020. 
Basis for Opinions
The Firm’s management is responsible for these 
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s report on internal control over financial 
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the 
Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to 
the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws 
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of 
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and 
whether effective internal control over financial reporting 
was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included 
performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures 
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts 
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our 
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal 
control over financial reporting included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and 
testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
Our audits also included performing such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over financial reporting includes those

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters 
arising from the current period audit of the consolidated 
financial statements that were communicated or required 
to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) 
relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the 
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our 
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter 
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing 
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the 
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component of 
Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios 
As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-
based component of the wholesale and credit card loan 
portfolios was $14.0 billion  on total portfolio-based 
retained loans of $711.4 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1. The 
Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s 
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining 
expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers 
expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The 
portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan 
losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan 
portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected 
credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying 
credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The 
credit loss factors applied are determined based on the 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the 
Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast 
macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are 
U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. 
This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan 
losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale 
and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are 
(i) the significant judgment and estimation by management 
in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. 
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the 
Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect 
its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet 
date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by 
management in determining the quantitative calculation 
utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to 
take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, 
which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, 
subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit 
loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments 
to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort 
involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and 
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our 
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of 
controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, 
including controls over model validation and generation of 
macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, 
among others, testing management’s process for estimating 
the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating 
the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used 
in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the 
reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. 
real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness 
and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) 
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s 
adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of 
model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and 
other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected 
in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included 
the use of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of 
certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic 
variables.
Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Firm carries $1.2 trillion  of its assets and 
$403.1 billion  of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring 
basis. Included in these balances are $9.6 billion  of trading 
assets and $41.5 billion  of liabilities measured at fair value 
on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, 
which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more 
inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant 
to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally 
developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to 
estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The 
unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the 
fair value of certain of these financial instruments include 
forward equity prices, volatility relating to interest rates 
and equity prices and correlation relating to interest rates, 
equity prices, credit and foreign exchange rates.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain 
level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) 
the significant judgment and estimation by management in 
determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn 
led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and 
effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit 
evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial 
instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of 
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of 
controls relating to the Firm’s determination of the fair 
value, including controls over models, inputs, and data. 
These procedures also included, among others, the 
involvement of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate 
of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and 
comparing management’s estimate to the independently 
developed estimate of fair value. Developing the 
independent estimate involved testing the completeness 
and accuracy of data provided by management, developing 
independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and 
utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable 
inputs.

Consolidated statements of cash flows
164 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
Note 1 – Basis of presentatio n
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“ JPMorgan Chase ” or the “Firm”), a 
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law 
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the 
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in 
investment banking, financial services for consumers and 
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction 
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of  JPMorgan 
Chase  and its subsidiaries conform to  U.S. GAAP. 
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the 
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by 
regulatory authorities.
Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been 
reclassified to conform with the current presentation . 
Notably in the first quarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified 
certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts 
payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a 
reduction to the carrying value of the associated tax-
oriented investments.  Refer to Note 25 for further 
information.
Consolidation   
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts 
of JPMorgan Chase  and other entities in which  the Firm has 
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by  
the Firm are not assets of  JPMorgan Chase and are not 
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial 
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is 
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.  
Voting interest entities
Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient 
equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that 
enable them to make significant decisions relating to the 
entity’s operations. For these types of entities,  the Firm’s 
determination of whether it has a controlling interest is 
primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests 
held. Entities in which  the Firm has a controlling financial 
interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ 
voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights 
that give  the Firm control, are consolidated by  the Firm.
Investments in companies in which  the Firm has significant 
influence over operating and financing decisions (but does 
not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are 
a c c o u n t e d  f o r  ( i )   i n  a c c o r d a n c e  w i t h  t h e  e q u i t y  m e t h o d  o f  
accounting (which requires  the Firm to recognize its 
p r o p o r t i o n a t e  s h a r e  o f  t h e  e n t i t y ’ s  n e t  e a r n i n g s ) ,  o r  ( i i )   a t  
fair value if the fair value option was elected. These 
investments are generally included in other assets, with 
income or loss included in noninterest revenue.Certain  Firm -sponsored asset management funds are 
structured as limited partnerships or limited liability 
companies. For many of these entities,  the Firm is the 
general partner or managing member, but the non-
affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove  
the Firm as the general partner or managing member 
without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple 
majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members 
have rights to participate in important decisions. 
Accordingly,  the Firm does not consolidate these voting 
interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the 
non-managing partners or members do not have 
substantive kick-out or participating rights , the Firm 
evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if  
the Firm is the general partner or managing member and 
has both power and a potentially significant interest.  
The Firm’s investment companies and asset management 
funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately-
held entities , including investments in buyouts, growth 
equity and venture opportunities. These investments are 
accounted for under investment company guidelines and, 
accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity 
ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated 
balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other 
assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. 
If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such 
specialized investment company guidelines.
Variable interest entities  
V I E s  a r e  e n t i t i e s  t h a t ,  b y  d e s i g n ,  e i t h e r  ( 1 )   l a c k  s u f f i c i e n t  
equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without 
additional subordinated financial support from other 
parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the 
ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s 
operations through voting rights, or do not have the 
obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the 
right to receive the residual returns of the entity.
The most common type of VIE is a n SPE. SPEs are commonly 
used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain 
assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to 
investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company 
selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of 
those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal 
documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash 
earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s 
investors and other parties that have rights to those cash 
flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors 
from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other 
entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.  
The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a 
controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the 
assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is 
the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities 
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic 
performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the Notes to consolidated financial statements
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 165
obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits 
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
To assess whether  the Firm has the power to direct the 
activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s 
economic performance,  the Firm considers all the facts and 
circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and 
its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment 
includes, first, identifying the activities that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and 
second, identifying which party, if any, has power over 
those activities. In general, the parties that make the most 
significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset 
managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call 
options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have 
the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are 
deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.
To assess whether  the Firm has the obligation to absorb 
losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the 
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE,  the Firm 
considers all of its economic interests, including debt and 
equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other 
arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. 
This assessment requires that  the Firm apply judgment in 
determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are 
considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors 
considered in assessing significance include: the design of 
the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination 
of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests 
held across various classes within the VIE’s capital 
structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by  the 
Firm.
The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether 
entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-
interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain 
events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation

circumstances regarding  the Firm’s involvement with a VIE 
cause  the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change.
Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs.
Revenue recognition  
Interest income  
The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt 
securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level-
yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer 
to Note  7 for further discussion of interest income.  
Revenue from contracts with customers  
JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from 
certain contracts with customers , in investment banking 
fees, deposit-related fees, asset management 
administration and commissions, and components of card 
income, when  the Firm’s related performance obligations 
are satisfied.  Refer to Note  6 for further discussion of  the 
Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers.  Principal transactions revenue  
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in 
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes  2 and 3 for 
further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note  
6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue.  
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets 
and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these 
estimates.
Foreign currency translation
JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. 
dollars using applicable exchange rates.
Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency 
financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the 
Consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Gains 
and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, 
including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency 
is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated 
statements of  income.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables 
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the 
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net 
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP 
also permits securities sold and purchased under 
repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned 
under securities loan agreements to be presented net when 
specified conditions are met, including the existence of a 
legally enforceable master netting agreement.  The Firm has 
elected to net such balances where it has determined that 
the specifie d conditions are met.
The Firm uses master netting agreements  to mitigate 
counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including 
derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities 
borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master 
netting agreement is a single agreement with a 
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed 
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and 
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the 
event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a 
required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral 
or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives 
termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all 
transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued 
and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are 
netted against the negative values of “out of the money” 
transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation 
is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination 
amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase Notes to consolidated financial statements
166 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) 
all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all 
values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are 
calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other 
and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation i s of one of 
the parties to pay the netted termination amount.
Typical master netting agreements for these types of 
transactions also often contain a collateral/margin 
agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title 
transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party 
that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding 
party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires 
a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding 
party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit 
on a net basis across all transactions governed by the 
master netting agreement, less any threshold. The 
collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding 
party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off 
any amounts payable by the counterparty against any 
posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted 
collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the 
right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the 
proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.
Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s 
derivative instruments. Refer to Note  11 for further 
discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements.
Statements of cash flows
For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash 
flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash 
and due from banks and deposits with banks  on the 
Consolidated balance sheets .Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)
The adoption of this guidance established a single 
allowance framework for all financial assets measured at 
amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit 
exposures . This framework requires that management’s 
estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s 
remaining expected life and considers expected future 
changes in macroeconomic conditions.  Prior to the adoption 
of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses represented management’s estimate of 
probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan 
portfolios and certain lending-related commitments. The 
adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, resulted in a $2.7 
billion decrease to retained earnings.

Note 2 – Fair value measurement 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly 
carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and 
liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on  
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, 
liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they 
are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are 
subject to fair value adjustments only in certain 
circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of 
impairment).
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. Fair value is base d on quoted  market 
prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not 
available, fair value is based on valuation models and other 
valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction 
characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, 
observable or unobservable market parameters, including  
yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as 
commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign 
exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments 
may be made to ensure that financial instruments are 
recorded at fair value, as described below.  
The level of precision in estimating unobservable market 
inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss 
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while  the 
Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across  the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.  
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of different 
methodologies or assumptions by other market participants 
compared with those used by  the Firm could result in  the 
Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the 
reporting date.  
Valuation process  
Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair 
value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  The Firm’s  
Valuation Control Group (“VCG”) , which is part of  the Firm’s 
Finance function and independent of the risk-taking 
functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and 
determining any fair value adjustments that may be 
required to ensure that  the Firm’s  positions are recorded at 
fair value. In addition, the Firm’s  Valuation Governance 
Forum (“VGF”), which  is composed of senior finance and 
risk executives , is responsible for overseeing the 
management of risks arising from valuatio n activities 
conducted across  the Firm.  The Firmwide VGF is chaired by 
the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of  the 
Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including 
Treasury and CIO.  
Price verification process  
The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-
taking functions by leveraging independently derived 
prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where 
available. Where independent prices or inputs are not 
available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the 
reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may 
include evaluating the limited market activity including 
client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those 
used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of 
structured instruments into individual components, 
comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit 
and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral 
valuation. There are also additional levels of management 
review for more significant or complex positions.
The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be 
required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking 
functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for 
instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further 
information on the fair value hierarchy). For other 
positions, judgment is required to assess the need for 
valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain 
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net 
open risk position. The determination of such adjustments 
follows a consistent framework across  the Firm:
•Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an 
observable external price or valuation parameter exists 
but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower 
market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are 
made based on current market conditions. Factors that 
may be considered in determining the liquidity 
adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-
offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) 
alternative pricing points for similar instruments in 
active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values 
that the price or parameter could take.  
•The Firm  manages certain portfolios of financial 
instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, 
as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the 
fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of 
the entire net open risk position in an orderly 
transaction. Where this is the case, valuation 
adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of 
exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk 
position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on 
factors that a relevant market participant would 
consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, 
including the size of the adverse market move that is 
likely to occur during the period required to reduce the 
net open risk position to a normal market-size.
•Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable 
parameters may be made when positions are valued 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 169
using prices or input parameters to valuation models 
that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or 
because they cannot be implied from observable market 
data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and 
are, therefore, subject to management judgment. 
Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty 
inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.  
•Where appropriate,  the Firm  also applies adjustments to 
its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately 
reflect counterparty credit quality  (CVA), the Firm’s  own 
creditworthiness  (DVA)  and the impact of funding  (FVA), 
using a consistent framework across  the Firm.  Refer to 
Credit and funding adjustments on page 186  of this Note 
for more information on such adjustments.
Valuation model review and approval  
If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a 
similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using 
valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms 
such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or 
independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case 
the price verification process described above is applied to 
the inputs in those models.  
Under  the Firm’s  Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, the  MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well 
as material changes to existing models, prior to 
implementation in the operating environment. In certain 
circumstances exceptions may be granted to  the Firm’s  
policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. The MRGR may also require the user to take 
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be 
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.  
Fair value hierarchy  
A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established 
under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. 
The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of 
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the 
measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.  
•Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are 
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets.  
•Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include 
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active 
markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the 
full term of the financial instrument.
•Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation 
methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair 
value measurement.  
A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value  
hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement.Notes to consolidated financial statements

(b)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. 
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not 
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities 
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further 
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have 
been included in each period presented.

Level 3 valuations
The Firm has established well-structured processes for 
determining fair value, including for instruments where fair 
value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs 
(level 3).  Refer to  pages 169-173  of this Note for further 
information on  the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed 
discussion of the determination of fair value for individual 
financial instruments.  
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent 
on the amount of observable market information available to  
the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed 
valuation models and other valuation techniques that use 
significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2.  
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant 
inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in 
deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield 
curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, 
volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or 
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign 
exchange rates and credit curves.  
The following table presents  the Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the 
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those 
inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such 
inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument 
within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable 
inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial 
instruments typically include observable components (that is, 
components that are actively quoted and can be validated to 
external sources) in addition to the unobservable 
components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not 
included in the table. In addition,  the Firm manages the risk 
of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments 
using securities and derivative positions that are classified 
within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
The range of values presented in the table is representative 
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the 
significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument 
classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the 
input values presented in the table are calculated based on 
the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used 
to value.  In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic 
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty 
or an assessment of the reasonableness of  the Firm’s 
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the 
characteristics of the various instruments held by  the Firm 
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range 
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation 
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied 
volatility levels because the option contracts have different 
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and 
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the 
characteristics of the instruments held by  the Firm at each 
balance sheet date.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs  
The following discussion provides a description of the impact 
on a fair value measurement of a change in each 
unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship 
between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. 
The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a 
change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change 
in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist 
between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are 
discussed below. Relationships may also exist between 
observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as 
observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment 
rates decline); such relationships have not been included in 
the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual 
relationships described below, the inverse relationship would 
also generally apply.  
The following discussion also provides a description of 
attributes of the underlying instruments and external market 
factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of  
the Firm’s positions.  
Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to 
discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow 
calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result 
in a decrease in a fair value measurement.  
Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional 
annualized return over the market interest rate that a market 
participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit 
risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument 
forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow 
calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would 
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.  
The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-
backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the 
instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of 
the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not 
correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, 
the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk 
inherent in various instruments owned by  the Firm. The risk 
inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the 
subordination of the security being valued and the 
characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the 
collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores,  LTV 
ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the 
property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For 
corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and 
municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads 
reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the 
obligation.  
Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of 
the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a 
prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment 
speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An 
increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a 
premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement 
of assets valued at a discount to par.  Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to 
collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the 
underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the 
obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) 
of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically 
collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a 
higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower 
credit quality, all other factors being equal.  
Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a 
measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral 
balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of 
defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship 
between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, 
collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral 
has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower 
conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default 
rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss 
severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the 
conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default 
rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a 
securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. 
Based on the types of securities owned in  the Firm’s market-
making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically 
at the lower end of the range presented.  
Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the 
recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized 
losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular 
loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the 
outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is 
generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default 
rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would 
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.  
The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed 
security investment depends on factors relating to the 
underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of 
the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-
specific factors.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 179
Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship 
between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a 
pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is 
driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are 
related to the type of derivative  (e.g., interest rate, credit, 
equity, foreign exchange and commodity)  due to the nature 
of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively 
correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an 
increase in the other parameter. When parameters are 
negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will 
result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in 
correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair 
value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an 
increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in 
a decrease in a fair value measurement.
The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives 
with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of 
factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the 
correlation between two credit risk exposures would be 
different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. 
Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the 
correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying 
risks may be different over different time periods. 
Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on 
market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of 
levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in 
volatile market conditions.  
Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible 
returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given 
how much the particular instrument, parameter or index 
changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for 
options, including equity options, commodity options, and 
interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of 
the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long 
position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, 
would generally result in an increase in a fair value 
measurement.  
The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular 
option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, 
including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., 
the volatility of a particular equity security may be 
significantly different from that of a particular commodity 
index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price 
of the option.  Interest rate curve – represents the relationship of interest 
rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to 
set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows 
and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any 
derivative cash flow.   
Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer 
agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract 
on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that 
the value of the contract is zero at inception.  
The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of 
certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors 
including interest rates, the current price of the underlying 
asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be 
incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until 
the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an 
increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.  
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements  
The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated 
balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for 
financial instruments classified by  the Firm within level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy for the years ended  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021 , 2020  and 2019 . When a determination is made to 
classify a financial instrument within level 3, the 
determination is based on the significance of the 
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. 
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in 
addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, 
observable components (that is, components that are actively 
quoted and can be validated to external sources); 
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include 
changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that 
are part of the valuation methodology. Also,  the Firm risk-
manages the observable components of level 3 financial 
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are 
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as 
these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are 
not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables 
do not reflect the effect of  the Firm’s risk management 
activities related to such level 3 instruments.Notes to consolidated financial statements

Level 3 analysis 
Consolidated balance sheets changes  
The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets 
since  December 31, 2020, for those items measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on  page 187  
for further information on changes impacting items measured 
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  
For the year ended December 31, 2021
Level 3 assets were $17.5 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
reflecting an increase of $1.1 billion  from December 31, 
2020.
The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 
predominantly driven by:
•$2.2 billion  increase in MSRs,
partially offset by
•$287 million  decrease in gross interest rate derivative 
receivables due to settlements net of gains.
•$372 million  decrease in non-trading loans due to 
settlements net of transfers.
Refer to Note 15 for information on MSRs.

Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives
Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as 
their basis observable market parameters. These market 
parameters generally do not consider factors such as 
counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit 
quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally 
necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair 
value to reflect these factors.
CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant 
benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty 
nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a 
scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit 
exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with 
each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the 
probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a 
result of a counterparty credit event considering 
contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit 
exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The 
key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a 
default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived 
from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated 
recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider 
the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor 
relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally 
reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.
FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of 
funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a 
market participant in the principal market would 
incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s 
FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including 
partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) 
derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected 
funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the 
estimated market funding cost in the principal market 
which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit 
risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is 
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the 
relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying 
collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a 
separate FVA is not necessary.
The following table provides the impact of credit and 
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in 
the respective periods, excluding the effect of any 
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below 
includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the 
inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes 
in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected 
liabilities
The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value 
option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s 
own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities 
reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) 
in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are 
estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread 
observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to 
DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in 
principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses 
are reported in OCI. Refer to page 184 in this Note and Note 
24 for further information.   Notes to consolidated financial statements

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or 
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer  (i.e., measurement alternative), 
with such changes recognized in other income.   
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes,  the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed 
necessary to arrive at  the Firm’s  estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different 
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with  the Firm’s valuation techniques for 
private equity direct investments.  
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of  
December 31, 2021 and 2020, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded 
during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the 
nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Class A common shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B 
common shares into Visa Class A common shares is  1.6181  at December 31, 2021, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on 
developments related to the litigation matters.   
Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial 
instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated 
balance sheets at fair value  
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of 
certain financial instruments, which are included in the 
following table. However, this table does not include other 
items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain 
financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the 
opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add 
significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is 
not disclosed in this table. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates 
fair value  
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at 
amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-
term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These 
instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with 
banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale 
agreements and securities borrowed, short-term 
receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term 
borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and 
sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and 
accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the 
fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., 
demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be 
equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent 
funding value of these instruments is not permitted.  Notes to consolidated financial statements

(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, 
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and 
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying 
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected 
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including 
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.  
The majority of  the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated

Note 3 – Fair value option 
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value 
as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, 
financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and 
written loan commitments.
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair 
value for several reasons including to mitigate income 
statement volatility caused by the differences between the 
measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain 
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an 
accrual basis) and the associated risk management 
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, 
as well as to  better reflect those instruments that are 
managed on a fair value basis.  The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following 
instruments:  
•Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization 
warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, 
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-
related commitments
•Certain securities financing agreements
•Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would 
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as 
a derivative instrument  
•Structured notes  and other hybrid instruments, which 
are predominantly financial instruments that contain 
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as 
part o f client-driven activities  
•Certain  long-term beneficial interests issued by  CIB’s 
consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying 
assets are carried at fair value  Notes to consolidated financial statements

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items 
for which the fair value option was elected  
The following describes how the gains and losses that are 
attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, 
were determined.  
•Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-
rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to 
instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate 
instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for 
the period is made between those changes in value that 
are interest rate-related and changes in value that are 
credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an 
analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to 
similar entities or industries.  
•Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to 
instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally 
from observable changes in  the Firm’s credit spread as 
observed in the bond market.  
•Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these 
types of agreements, there is a requirement that 
collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or 
in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, 
there would be no adjustment or an immaterial 
adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to 
these agreements.

Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, 
counterparties or customers are engaged in similar 
business activities or activities in the same geographic 
region, or when they have similar economic features that 
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to 
be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.
JPMorgan Chase  regularly monitors various segments of its 
credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk 
concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when 
deemed necessary and permitted under  the Firm’s  
agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in 
the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are 
adjusted as needed to reflect  the Firm’s  risk appetite.
In the Firm’s  consumer portfolio, concentrations are 
managed primarily by product and by U .S. geographic 
region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the 
portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations 
can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies 
and portfolio guidelines.  Refer to Note  12 for additional 
information on the geographic composition of  the Firm’s 
consumer loan portfolios . In the wholesale portfolio, credit 
risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and 
monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level 
and on an individual client or counterparty basis.  The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan 
syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, 
credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral 
and other risk-reduction techniques . Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information on loans. 
The Firm  does not believe that its exposure to any 
particular loan product  or industry segment  results in a 
significant concentration of credit risk.  
Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included 
in the Firm’s  assessment when extending credit and 
establishing its allowance for loan losses.  Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 5 – Derivative instruments 
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying 
asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a 
combination of these factors and may expose 
counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset 
or liability without having to initially invest in, own or 
exchange the asset or liability.  JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives 
to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly 
all of  the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-
making or risk management purposes.  
Market-making derivatives  
The majority of  the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for 
market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate 
or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and 
commodity risks.  The Firm actively manages the risks from 
its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other 
derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other 
financial instruments that partially or fully offset the 
exposure from client derivatives.  
Risk management derivatives  
The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures 
using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge 
accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used 
to manage risks associated with specified assets and 
liabilities.  
The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate 
assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market 
value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income 
and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-
rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, 
and as a result of the repayment and subsequent 
origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at 
current market rates.  Gains and losses on the derivative 
instruments related to these assets and liabilities are 
expected to substantially offset this variability.  
Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the 
foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign 
currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and 
liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as  the Firm’s 
net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches 
whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a 
result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–
equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated 
assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses 
increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative 
instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated 
assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected 
to substantially offset this variability.  Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk 
of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these 
derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset 
the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.  
Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty 
credit risk associated with loans and lending-related 
commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser 
when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a 
credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an 
obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of 
CDS.  Refer to the Credit derivatives section on  pages 
207-210  of this Note for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives.  
Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses 
table on  page 207  of this Note, and the hedge accounting 
gains and losses tables on  pages 204-206  of this Note for 
more information about risk management derivatives.  
Derivative counterparties and settlement types  
The Firm enters into OTC derivatives , which are negotiated 
and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty.  The 
Firm also enters into, as principal, certain  ETD such as 
futures and options, and  OTC-cleared derivative contracts 
with CCPs.  ETD contracts are generally standardized 
contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, 
which is  the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the 
transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a 
bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.  
Derivative clearing services  
The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which  the 
Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and 
clearing houses.  The Firm does not reflect the clients’ 
derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial 
Statements.  Refer to Note  28 for further information on  the 
Firm’s clearing services.  
Accounting for derivatives  
All free-standing derivatives that  the Firm executes for its 
own account are required to be recorded on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  
As permitted under U.S. GAAP , the Firm nets derivative 
assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral 
receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable 
master netting agreement exists between  the Firm and the 
derivative counterparty.  Refer to Note  1 for further 
discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities.  The 
accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on 
whether or not the transaction has been designated and 
qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not 
designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair 
value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on  pages 
200-207  of this Note provide additional information on the 
amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, 
gains and losses.  Refer to Notes  2 and 3 for a further 
discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.  Notes to consolidated financial statements
196 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
Derivatives designated as hedges  
The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives 
executed for risk management purposes – generally interest 
rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. 
However,  JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge 
accounting to all of the derivatives involved in  the Firm’s 
risk management activities. For example,  the Firm does not 
apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage 
the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, 
because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as 
hedges. For the same reason,  the Firm does not apply 
hedge accounting to certain interest rate , foreign exchange , 
and commodity derivatives used for risk management 
purposes.   
To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly 
effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure 
being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated 
as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy 
must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify 
the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or 
forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and 
how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed 
prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness,  
the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression 
analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value 
comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative 
to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged 
item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the 
evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to 
which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to 
be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or 
cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and 
documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a 
derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated 
exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.  
There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair 
value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.  
JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge 
fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain 
commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, 
the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the 
value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are 
recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the 
assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and 
recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the 
hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to 
the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the 
basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate 
hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. 
Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized 
consistent with the classification of the hedged item – 
primarily net interest income and principal transactions 
revenue.  
JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge 
the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from 
floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency–
denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are 
recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged 
item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting 
earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of 
the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net 
interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge 
relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the 
derivative recorded in  AOCI is recognized in earnings when 
the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge 
relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted 
transaction is expected to not occur according to the 
original hedge forecast, any related derivative values 
recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.  
JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the 
value of  the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. 
subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are 
not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes 
in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as 
translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the 
assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in 
earnings.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , gross and net derivative receivables and payables by 
contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same 
counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where  the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion 
with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are 
not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown 
separately in the tables below.  
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and 
payables,  the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate 
counterparty credit risk associated with  the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:  
•collateral that consists of  l i q u i d  s e c u r i t i e s  a n d  o t h e r  c a s h  c o l l a t e r a l  h e l d  a t  t h i r d - p a r t y  c u s t o d i a n s ,  w h i c h   a r e  s h o w n  
separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets " in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure 
amount.  For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality 
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; 
•the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of 
the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and  
•collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not 
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features  
In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose  JPMorgan Chase to 
credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts 
and the collateral, if any, held by  the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of  
JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral 
agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.  
While derivative receivables expose  the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose  the Firm  to liquidity risk, as the 
derivative contracts typically require  the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the 
contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in  the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit 
ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either  the 
Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net 
derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that 
may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral  the Firm has posted in the normal course of 
business, at  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of  JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries , predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , related to OTC 
and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings 
downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the 
predefined  rating  threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a 
preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral 
(except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination 
payment  requirements . The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating 
of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale  of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances  the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure 
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer.  The 
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in  Note 11, but in limited 
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers 
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding w as not material at both  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020 .

(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses 
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were 
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net 
realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward 
points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through 
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. 
(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-
currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.Notes to consolidated financial statements

applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing 
unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future 
periods.
(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not 
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 , the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is 
$ 1 4 . 0   b i l l i o n and $ 1 4 . 5   b i l l i o n, respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 1 0 . 8   b i l l i o n and $ 6 . 6   b i l l i o n, respectively.
(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 10 for additional information.
(d)Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended  2021 , 2020  and 2019 .
Over the next 12 months,  the Firm expects that approximately  $671 million  (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at  
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been

approximately  eight years , corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.  For open cash flow 
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately  six years . The Firm’s 
longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

principal transactions revenue.
(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making 
activities and other derivatives  
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the 
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain 
risks associated with net open risk positions from  its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not 
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk 
management categories above are included in this 
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are 
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer 
to Note  6 for information on principal transactions revenue.  Credit derivatives  
Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is 
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a 
third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow 
one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to 
another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives 
expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of 
the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to 
make payments under the contract when the reference 
entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a 
failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of 
credit protection receives a premium for providing 
protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument 
referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.  
The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the 
credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two 
primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker,  
the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives 
by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly 
on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of 
customers. Second, as an end-user,  the Firm uses credit 
derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending 
exposures (loans and unfunded commitments)  in its 
wholesale and consumer businesses a nd derivatives 
counterparty exposures in its  wholesale businesses, and to 
manage the credit risk arising from certain financial 
instruments in  the Firm’s market-making businesses. 
Following is a summary of various types of credit 
derivatives.  
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 207
Credit default swaps  
Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single 
reference entity (“single- name”) , broad-based inde x or 
portfolio.  The Firm purchases and sells protection on both 
single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name 
CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared 
derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage 
the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS 
contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with 
the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like 
the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists 
of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New 
series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new 
underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes 
in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the 
index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity 
that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be 
referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or 
against customized exposure levels based on specific client 
demands: for example, to provide protection against the 
first $1 million  of realized credit losses in a  $10 million  
portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known 
as tranche CDS.  
For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS 
contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the 
terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract 
has recourse to the reference entity. The protection 
purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the 
difference between the face value of the CDS contract and 
the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of 
the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery 
value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the 
debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order 
to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a 
credit event occurs.  Credit-related notes  
A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the 
issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note 
investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. 
Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par 
value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in 
return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, 
based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer 
also repays the investor the par value of the note at 
maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities 
that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified 
credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not 
obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the 
issuer pays the investor the difference between the par 
value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted 
reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party 
to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting 
reference entity.
The following tables present a summary of the notional 
amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes  the 
Firm sold and purchased as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020 . Upon a credit event,  the Firm as a seller of protection 
would typically pay out only a percentage of the full 
notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount 
actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into 
account the recovery value of the reference obligation at 
the time of settlement.  The Firm manages the credit risk on 
contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with 
identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other 
purchased protection referenced in the following tables 
includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not 
identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio 
coverage and other reference points) as well as protection 
purchased  by CIB through credit-related notes primarily in 
its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains 
credit protection against certain loans in the retained 
consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related 
notes. Since these credit-related notes are not part of the 
market-making businesses they are not included in the 
table below. Notes to consolidated financial statements
208 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, 
because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value 
of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in  the Firm’s view, the 
risks associated with such derivatives.

Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense
Noninterest revenue
The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain 
contracts with customers in investment banking fees, 
deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, 
and commissions, and components of card income. The 
related contracts are often terminable on demand and  the 
Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. 
For arrangements with a fixed term,  the Firm may commit 
to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with 
these remaining performance obligations typically depends 
on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset 
values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those 
events or values are known.
Investment banking fees  
This revenue category includes debt and equity 
underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter,  the Firm 
helps clients raise capital via public offering and private 
placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. 
Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price 
and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are 
recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the 
client’s transaction.  The Firm  also manages and syndicates 
loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication 
fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded 
as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and 
yield criteria.  
The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its 
clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, 
restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees 
are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the 
client’s transaction.

Total investment banking fees $ 13,216 $ 9,486 $ 7,501 
Investment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer 
to Note 32 for segment results.Principal transactions  
Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, 
including:  
•the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the 
price at which a market participant is willing and able to 
sell an instrument to  t h e  F i r m  and the price at which 
another market participant is willing and able to buy it 
from  the Firm , and vice versa; and  
•realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, including 
those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily 
used in client-driven market-making activities, and on 
private equity investments.  
–Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, 
or interim cash payments.  
–Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation.  
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities,  the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities.  
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and 
unrealized gains and losses related to:  
•derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting 
relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity 
and foreign exchange risk;  
•derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, 
primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange 
risk.
Refer to Note  5 for further information on the income 
statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives 
activities.  
In the financial commodity markets,  the Firm transacts in 
OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and  ETD 
that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In 
the physical commodity markets,  the Firm primarily 
purchases and sells precious  and base metals  and may hold 
other commodities inventories under financing and other 
arrangements with clients. 
The following table presents all realized and unrealized 
gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. 
This table excludes interest income and interest expense on 
trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of 
the overall performance of  the Firm’s client-driven market-
making activities  in CIB and fund deployment activities  in 
T r e a s u r y  a n d  C I O .  Refer to Note  7 for further information 
on interest income and interest expense.  
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type.  
The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses 
generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection 
with their market-making and related risk-management 
activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the 
table below is not representative of the total revenue of any 
individual LOB.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
This revenue category includes fees from investment 
management and related services, custody, brokerage 
services and other products.  The Firm manages assets on 
behalf of its clients, including investors in  Firm -sponsored 
funds and owners of separately managed investment 
accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value 
of assets under management and are collected and 
recognized at the end of each period over which the 
management services are provided and the value of the 
managed assets is known.  The Firm also receives 
performance-based management fees, which are earned 
based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other 
performance targets and are accrued and recognized when 
the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of 
the related billing period.  The Firm has contractual 
arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and 
other services in connection with its asset management 
activities. Amounts paid to these third-party service 
providers are generally recorded in professional and outside services expense.

Firm reports certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and 
exchanges net against commission revenue.
Asset management, administration and commissions are 
earned primarily by AWM, CIB and CCB. Refer to Note 32 for 
segment results.
Mortgage fees and related income
This revenue category reflects  CCB’s Home Lending 
production and net mortgage servicing revenue.  
Production revenue includes fees and income recognized as 
earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, 
and the impact of risk management activities associated 
with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans.

Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in 
interest income.  
Card income
This revenue category includes interchange and other 
income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees 
earned from processing card transactions for merchants, 
both of which are recognized when purchases are made by 
a cardholder and presented net of certain transaction-
related costs. Card income also includes account origination 
costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized 
on a straight-line basis over a  12-month period.
Certain  credit card products offer the cardholder the ability 
to earn points based on account activity, which the 
cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash 
rewards. The cost to  the Firm related to these proprietary 
rewards programs varies based on multiple factors 
including the terms and conditions of the rewards 
programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward 
redemption rates and cardholder reward selections.  The 
Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its 
rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a 
reduction of card income.  
Credit card revenue sharing agreements 
The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co-
brand partners that grant  the Firm exclusive rights to issue 
co-branded credit card products and market them to the 
customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co-
brand credit card programs and provide their customer or 
member lists to  the Firm. The partners may also conduct 
marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under 
their own loyalty programs that  the Firm will grant to co-
brand credit cardholders based on account activity.  The 
terms of these agreements generally range from  five to ten 
years .The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit 
card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing 
activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit 
cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. 
Payments to partners based on marketing efforts 
undertaken by the partners are expensed by  the Firm as 
incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for 
partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a 
reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to 
partners based on new credit card account originations are 
accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are 
deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a 
straight-line basis over a  12-month period. Payments to 
partners based on sales volumes are reported as a 
reduction of card income when the related interchange 
income is earned.

Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement 
employee benefit plans  
The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and  
OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the 
U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations.  Substantially all the 
defined benefit pension plans are closed to new 
participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in 
the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, 
was closed to new participants and frozen for existing 
participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for 
new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits 
continue to accrue to participants’ accounts based on their 
accumulated balances.
The Firm maintains  funded and unfunded postretirement 
benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for 
certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their dependents covered under these programs. None of these 
plans have a material impact on  the Firm’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements.  
The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan 
in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in 
certain non- U.S. locations. The most significant of these 
plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the 
401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. 
employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings 
Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis.  The 
Firm makes an annual matching c ontribution as well as an  
annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings 
Plan on behalf of eligible participants.  
The following table presents the pretax  benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in 
AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for  the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , was 2.54%  and 
2.17% , respectively.
Gains and losses
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI.   
Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods, if, as of the 
beginning of the year,  the net gain or loss exceeds  10%  of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of 
the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen 
status of most plans. For the years ended  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , the net gain was p redominantly attributable to a 
market-driven increase in the fair value of plan assets and changes in the discount rate.  
The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income 
for the Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the 
defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 215
Plan assumptions
The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return is a blended 
weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected long-
term returns for the various asset classes, taking into 
consideration local market conditions and the specific 
allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are 
developed using a forward-looking approach and are not 
strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given 
to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each 
plan.  
The discount rates used in determining the benefit 
obligations are generally provided by  the Firm’s actuaries , 
with the Firm’s principal defined bene fit pension plan using 
a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on 
portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that 
closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows.  Investment strategy and asset allocation
The assets of  the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are 
held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified 
portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and 
cash equivalents, and alternative investments.  The Firm 
regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, 
as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, 
which are rebalanced when deemed necessary.  The 
approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for  the 
Firm’s principal defined benefit plan are  42-100%  debt  
securities,  0-40%  equity securi ties, 0-3% real estate , and  
0-12%  alternatives  as of December 31, 2021 .
As of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, assets held by  the Firm’s defined 
benefit pension  and OPEB plans do not include securities 
issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through 
indirect exposures through investments in exchange traded 
funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds 
managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension  and 
OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or 
managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of  
$2.5 billion  and $2.7 billion , as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020 , respectively.

Note 9 – Employee share-based incentiv es
Employee share-based awards
In 2021 , 2020  and 2019 , JPMorgan Chase  granted long-
term share-based awards to certain employees under its  
LTIP, a s  a m e n d e d  a n d  r e s t a t e d  e f f e c t i v e  M a y   15, 2018, and 
subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the 
terms of the LTIP, as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 83 million  
shares of  common stock were available for issuance 
t h r o u g h  M a y   2 0 2 5 .  T h e  L T I P  i s  t h e  o n l y  a c t i v e  p l a n  u n d e r  
which  the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive 
awards. In the following discussion, t he LTIP, plus prior  Firm 
plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are 
referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans 
constitute  the Firm’s share-based incentive plans.  
RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their 
grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a 
rate of  50%  after  two years  and 50%  after  three years  and 
are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting 
date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility 
provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon 
voluntary termination based on age or service-related 
requirements, subject to post-employment and other 
restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until 
vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in 
cancellation under certain specified circumstances. 
Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash 
payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the 
underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are 
outstanding . 
Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, 
and approved by  the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members 
of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable 
compensation program. PSUs are subject to  the Firm’s 
achievement of specified performance criteria over a  three -
year period. The number of awards that vest can range 
from  zero  to 150%  of the grant amount. In addition, 
dividends that accrue during the vesting period are 
reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the 
related dividend equivalent share units are converted into 
shares of common stock after vesting.Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have 
vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after 
applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional  
two-year  period, for a total combined vesting and holding 
period of approximately  five to eight  years from the grant 
date depending on regulations in certain countries. 
Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and 
stock options have generally been granted with an exercise 
price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common 
stock on the grant date.  SARs and stock options generally 
expire  ten years  after the grant date.  In 2021, t he Firm 
awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief 
Operating Officer  1 . 5   m i l l i o n and 750,000  SARs, 
respectively.  There were no material grants of SARs or stock 
options  in 2020 and 2019. 
The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for 
each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as 
if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. 
Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense 
is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date 
until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided 
that the employees will not become full-career eligible 
during the vesting period. For awards with full-career 
eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future 
substantive service requirement,  the Firm accrues the 
estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to 
employees as of the grant date without giving consideration 
to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each 
tranche granted to employees who will become full-career 
eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is 
recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until 
the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or 
the vesting date of the respective tranche.  
The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of 
employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either 
new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 
2021 , 2020  and 2019 , the Firm settled all of its employee 
share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.  
Refer to Note 23 for further information on the 
classification of share-based awards for purposes of 
calculating earnings per share.Notes to consolidated financial statements
218 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity  
Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock 
price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 
Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes  
JPMorgan Chase ’s RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity for  2021 .

Note 10 – Investment s ecuritie s
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are 
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as 
trading assets are discussed in Note  2. Predominantly all of  
the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by  Treasury and 
CIO in connection with its asset-liability management 
activities.
AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any 
applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for 
credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific 
identification method is used to determine realized gains 
and losses on AFS securities, which are included in 
investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated 
statements of income. HTM securities, which  the Firm has 
the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at 
amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or 
premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a 
level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security.  
However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are 
amortized to the earliest call date. 
During the second quarter of 2021 , the Firm transferred 
$104.5 billion  of investment securities from AFS to HTM for 
capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax 
unrealiz ed gains of $ 4 2 5   m i l l i o n on the securities at the 
date of transfer.
Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these 
securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized 
into interest income on a level-yield basis over the 
remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset 
the effect on interest income of the amortization of the 
premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at 
fair value.   
Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash 
transactions and are recorded at fair value.  Notes to consolidated financial statements

accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest 
receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse through 
interest income any accrued interest receivables for the years ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the investment securities portfolio 
consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of  
AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and 
where not available, based primarily upon internal risk 
ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality 
of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio.  The 
Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the 
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the 
economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of 
default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”)) may differ as 
they reflect internal historical experiences and 
assumptions.  Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition,  
reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk 
Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the 
investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s 
ability to fulfill its obligations.

 AFS securities impairment  
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021  and 2020 . The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE and government agency 
MBS with unrealized losses of $2.2 billion  and $150 million , at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively; changes in the 
value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the 
explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is 
less than the amortized cost.  
The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if  the 
Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more 
likely than not that  the Firm will be required to sell the debt 
security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these 
circumstances the impairment loss recognized in 
investment securities gains/(losses)  is equal to the full 
difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if 
applicable) and the fair value of the securit y. 
For impaired debt securities that  the Firm has the intent 
and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to 
determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a 
credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for 
credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount 
of impairment. Any impairment not due to credit losses is 
recorded in OCI.  
Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include 
adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, 
geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or 
underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of 
the security.  
When assessing securities issued in a securitization for 
credit losses,  the Firm estimates cash flows considering 
relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level 
data, and structural features of the securitization, such as 
subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other 
forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses 
projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) 
against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization 
structure to determine whether these features are sufficient 
to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.  
For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated 
below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually 
prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that  the Firm 
would not recover substantially all of its recorded 
investment,  the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses 
when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.

HTM securities – credit risk
Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses represents expected credit 
losses over the remaining expected life of HTM securities.
The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. 
states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed 
securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss 
factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The 
credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of 
five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic 
scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line 
interpolation to revert to long run historical information for 
periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note  13 for 
further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic 
forecast.  
The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan 
obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities
is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost 
and the present value of the cash flows expected to be 
collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest 
rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on 
expectations of underlying collateral performance derived 
using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the 
single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering 
the structural features of the security.  
The application of different inputs and assumptions into the 
calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to 
significant management judgment, and emphasizing one 
input or assumption over another, or considering other 
inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the 
allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.  
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the 
risk rating assigned to each security. At both  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021  and 2020 , all HTM securities were rated investment 
grade and were current and accruing, with approximately  
98%  rated at least AA+.  Allowance for credit losses  on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment securities was 
$ 4 2   m i l l i o n and $ 7 8   m i l l i o n as of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020 , respectively. The allowance for credit losses on 
investment securities as of December 31, 2020 included a 
$ 1 0   m i l l i o n cumulative-effect adjustment to retained 
earnings upon the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020.

Note 11 – Securities financing activities
JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities 
borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, 
“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance  the 
Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short 
sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs,  settle 
other securities obligations  and to deploy  the Firm’s excess 
cash.  
Securities financing agreements are treated as 
collateralized financings on  the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting 
guidance, securities financing agreements with the same 
counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to  Note 1 
for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and 
liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with 
securities financing agreements are recorded over the life 
of the agreement in interest income and interest expense 
on the Consolidated statements of income.  
The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain 
securities financing agreements. Refer to Note  3 for further 
information regarding the fair value option. The securities 
financing agreements for which the fair value option has 
been elected are reported within securities purchased 
under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements 
carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are 
recorded within interest income and interest expense, with 
changes in fair value reported in principal transactions 
revenue. However, for financial instruments containing 
embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted 
for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid 
instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest 
elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.  
Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair 
value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of 
the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, 
the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with 
respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as 
of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Credit risk mitigation practices
Securities financing agreements expose  the Firm primarily 
to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks,  the Firm 
monitors the value of the underlying securities 
(predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including 
government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government 
agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its 
counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and 
exchanged collateral, and either requests additional 
collateral or returns securities or collateral when 
appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based 
upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, 
and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an 
ongoing basis.  
In resale and securities borrowed agreements,  the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the 
securities received is less than initial cash principal 
advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In 
repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk 
exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying 
securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash 
principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. 
Additionally,  the Firm typically enters into master netting 
agreements and other similar arrangements with its 
counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the 
underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged 
in the event of a counterparty default.  It is also  the Firm’s 
policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities 
underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements.  
Refer to Note  29 for further information regarding assets 
pledged and collateral received in securities financing 
agreemen ts.Notes to consolidated financial statements

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of  
the Firm’s securities fin ancing agreements, as of  
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 . When  the Firm has obtained 
an appropriate legal opinion with res pect to a master 
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met,  the Firm 
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances 
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with 
the same counterparty. In addition,  the Firm exchanges 
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to 
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but 
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance 
sheet presentation. Where  the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty 
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in 
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the 
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net 
amounts” presented.  Where a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances 
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.  In 
transactions where  the Firm is acting as the lender in a 
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives 
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral,  the Firm 
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other 
assets and the obligation to return those securities within 
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets.

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s 
strategy for the loan.  The Firm accounts for loans based on 
the following categories:
•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., 
“retained”)
•Loans held-for-sale
•Loans at fair value
The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of 
the Firm’s loans by category:
Loans held-for-investment
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment , 
including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting 
the principal amount outstanding, net of  the following: 
unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or 
discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign 
exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance 
charges and fees.
Interest income
Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is 
accrued and recognized as interest income at the 
contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or 
premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are 
amortized into interest income over the contractual life of 
the loan as an adjustment of yield.  
The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including 
accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in 
accrued interest and accounts receivables on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued 
interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, 
with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for 
credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on 
accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the 
provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized 
by reversing interest income. Expected losses related to 
accrued interest on certain performing, modified loans to 
borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in  the 
Firm’s allowance for loan losses. For other loans,  the Firm 
generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses 
on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to 
write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing 
interest income.  
Nonaccrual loans  
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest 
has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans 
and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government 
agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered 
nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest 
is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when 
principal and interest has been in default for a period of  90 
days  or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in 
the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past 
due when the minimum payment is not received from the 
borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a 
monthly payment is due and unpaid for  30 days  or more. 
Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained  
on nonaccrual status. 
On the date a loan is place d on nonaccrual status, all 
interest accrued but not collected is reversed against 
interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred 
amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans 
may be recognized as cash interest payments are received 
(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is 
deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt 
regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan 
balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the 
carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For 
consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in  
the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual 
consumer loans on a cash basis.
A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is 
reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated 
performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, 
the terms of the restructured loan.  
As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are 
generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; 
accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans 
continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in 
full. 
Allowance for loan losses  
The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated 
expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan 
portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the 
balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized 
cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for 
loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on  
the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to 
Note  13 for further information on  the Firm’s accounting 
policies for the allowance for loan losses.  
Charge-offs  
Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down 
to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable 
value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less 
estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for 
loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency 
in accordance with standards established by the  FFIEC. 
Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans 
and scored business banking loans are generally charged 
off no later than  180 days  past due.  Scored auto and 
modified credit card loans are charged off no later than  120 
days  past due.  
Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to 
their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off 
standards in certain circumstances as follows:  
•Loans modified in a  TDR that are determined to be 
collateral-dependent.  
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 229
•Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that 
suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are 
subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., 
residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or 
charged down within  60 days of receiving notification of 
a bankruptcy filing). 
•Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile.  
Other than in certain limited circumstances,  the Firm 
typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-
guaranteed portion of loans.  
Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain 
that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether 
to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including 
the prioritization of  the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, 
expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and 
valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral.  
When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized 
cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying 
collateral, the determination of the fair value of the 
collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, 
real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of 
liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market 
prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other 
financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally 
estimated using a discounted cash flow model.  
For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based 
upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely 
that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay,  the 
Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an 
automated valuation model of the home based on an 
exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then 
updated at least every  12 months , or more frequently 
depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable 
after  the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt 
(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm 
generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that 
includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). 
Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted 
based upon  the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation 
values as compared with the estimated values provided by 
exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-
specific factors.  
For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are 
generally based on appraisals from internal and external 
valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated 
every  six to twelve months , either by obtaining a new 
appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in 
accordance with  the Firm’s policies.  The Firm also considers 
both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may 
result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price 
opinions at more frequent intervals.Loans held-for-sale  
Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair 
value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest 
revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on 
a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is 
performed on an individual loan basis.  
Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and 
recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.  
Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts 
or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the 
related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and 
discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the 
loan and therefore are included in the periodic 
determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments 
and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.  
Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or 
fair value,  the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-
off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans 
held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies 
described above.  
Loans at fair value  
Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are 
measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded 
in noninterest revenue.  
Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized 
based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair 
value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan 
origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest 
revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the 
associated expense category as incurred.  
Because these loans are recognized at fair value,  the Firm’s  
allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not 
apply to these loans.  However, loans at fair value are 
subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.   
Refer to Note  3 for further information on  the Firm’s 
elections of fair value accounting under the fair value 
option. Refer to Note  2 and Note  3 for further information 
on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading 
assets.  Notes to consolidated financial statements
230 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
Loan classification changes  
Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that 
management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-
sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date 
of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the 
allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as 
those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency 
exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.  
In the event that management decides to retain a loan in 
the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the 
held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date 
of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for 
impairment based on  the Firm’s allowance methodology.  
Refer to Note  13 for a further discussion of the 
methodologies used in establishing  the Firm’s allowance for 
loan losses.  
Loan modifications  
The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with 
its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification,  
JPMorgan Chase  grants one or more concessions to a 
borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to 
minimize  the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or 
repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize 
payments received by  the Firm from the borrower. The 
concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-
specific characteristics, and may include interest rate 
reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal 
forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in 
lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and 
reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions are not TDRs.  
Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are 
generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many 
cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to 
modification. These loans may be returned to performing 
status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following 
criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the 
modified terms for a minimum of six months  and/or six 
payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that 
repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based 
on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of 
future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other 
current market considerations. In certain limited and well-
defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the 
modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual 
status at the time of modification.  
Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for 
impairment using  the Firm’s established asset-specific 
allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-
default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a 
TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific 
component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, 
regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been 
returned to accrual status. Refer to Note  13 for further  
discussion of the methodology used to estimate  the Firm’s 
asset-specific allowance.  The Firm  granted various forms of assistance to customers 
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including 
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The 
majority of  the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications 
have not been considered TDRs because:  
•they represent short-term or other insignificant 
modifications, whether under  the Firm’s regular loan 
modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory 
guidance, or  
•the Firm  elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance 
under the option provided by the CARES Act, as 
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act and 
which expired on January 1, 2022.  
To the extent that certain modifications did not meet any of 
the above criteria,  the Firm account ed for them as TDRs.   
As permitted by regulatory guidance,  the Firm did not place 
loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on 
nonaccrual status where such loans were not otherwise 
reportable as nonaccrual.  The Firm consider ed expected 
losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all 
COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for 
credit losses.  
Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual 
status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would 
have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.  
Foreclosed  property  
The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan 
restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property 
acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real 
estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal 
property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).  
The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving 
assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or 
physical possession). For loans collateralized by real 
property,  the Firm generally recognizes the asset received 
at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of 
foreclosure transaction with the borrower.  Foreclosed 
assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated 
balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less 
estimated costs to sell.  Each quarter the fair value of the 
acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to 
the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to 
fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. 
Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and 
maintenance, are charged to other expense.
Foreclosures have resumed after having been temporarily 
suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic .

Loan portfolio  
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into  three  portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by  the Firm to determine 
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment  the 
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist 
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity 
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, 
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. 
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by 
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only 
payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may 
result in negative amortization.  
The following table provides information about retained 
consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(a)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020, included $5.4 billion  and $19.2 
billion  of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator 
for consumer loans. Loans that are more than  30 days  past 
due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be 
experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be 
unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues 
to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely 
to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential 
real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than  
150 days  past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will 
ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation 
transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit 
quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the 
class of loan, as follows:  
•For residential real estate loans, the current estimated 
LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior 
lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in 
the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV 
ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued 
willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV 
loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the 
borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic 
distribution of the loan collate ral also provides insight as 
to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as 
the regional economy, home price changes and specific 
events such as natural disasters, will affect credit 
quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO 
score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain 
loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s 
credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a 
low FICO score (less than  660) is considered to be of 
higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO 
score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV 
ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default 
than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio 
and a high FICO score.
•For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic 
distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of 
the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, 
geographic distribution provides insights into the 
portfolio performance based on regional economic 
activity and events.Notes to consolidated financial statements

(a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $35 million  and $36 
million ; 30–149 days past due included $11 million  and $16 million ; and 150 or more days past due included $20 million  and $24 million  at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively.
(b)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their 
deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.
(c)At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $31 million  and $40 
million , respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. 
(d)Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
(e)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
Approximately  37%  of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien 
position  the Firm holds is considered in  the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to 
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the 
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available 
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in 
accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower 
(“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, approximately 7% of Chapter 7 
residential real estate loans were 30 days  or more past due.
(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-
dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying 
collateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $172 million  and $161 million  for the years ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively.
(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 
payment related deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.
(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and 
interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , these balances were 
no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or 
more days past due and still accruing interest at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .
(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, 
quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and 
forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as 
unused lines, related to the property.
(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included residential real estate loans , primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score . These loans have been 
included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality .
(i) Prior-period  amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(j) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(k) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1.
(l) At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $66 million  and $76 million , respectively. These amounts have 
been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.Notes to consolidated financial statements

Loan modifications  
Modifications of residential real estate loans, where  the 
Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported 
as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions are not 
TDRs nor are loans for which  the Firm has elected to 
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option  
provided by the CARES Act. The carrying value of new TDRs 
was $866 million , $819 million  and $ 4 9 0   m i l l i o n for the 
years ended  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 2020  and 2019 , 
respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend 
to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been 
modified in TDRs.Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as 
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, 
generally provide various concessions to financially 
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest 
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of 
principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise 
have been required under the terms of the original 
agreement.  The following table provides information about 
how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs 
under  the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above 
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 
loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of 
debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions, and 
loans for which  the Firm has elected to  suspend TDR 
accounting guidance under the option provided by the 
CARES Act .

(a)Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages 
exceeds 100%  because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are 
generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.
(b)Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of 
residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans 
modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications 
and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where 
the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not

(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred 
within one year  of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such 
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments 
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. 
Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months  may not be representative of ultimate redefault  levels.
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified 
in TDRs wer e 4 years . The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and 
involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).  
Active and suspended foreclosure  
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government 
agencies, with a carrying value of  $619 million  and $846 million , respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the 
process of active or suspended foreclosure.Notes to consolidated financial statements

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans 
originated and purchased by  the Firm. Delinquency rates 
are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans 
as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be 
experiencing difficulties  (30 days  past due); information on 
those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer 
period of time  (90 days  past due) is also considered. In 
addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of 
the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the 
portfolio based on the regional economy.
While the borrower’s credit score is another general 
indicator of credit quality,  the Firm does not view credit 
scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the  
borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of 
credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score  
does not capture all factors that would be predictive of 
future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score 
information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a 
statistically significant random sample of the credit card 
portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is 
considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.
The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime 
consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO 
scores may decrease over time, depending on the 
performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit 
score calculation.

Loan modifications  
The Firm may o ffer loan modification programs granting 
concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty.  The Firm grants concessions for most of 
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These 
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed 
payment plan, generally for  60 months, and typically 
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. 
Substantially all modifications under  the Firm’s long-term 
programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term 
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions are not TDRs.  
If the cardholder does not comply with the modified 
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age 
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with  the 
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases,  the Firm 
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.  Financial effects of modifications and redefaults  
The following table provides information about the financial 
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans 
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. 
For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than  
1% of total retained credit card loans.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is 
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses  two 
consecutive contractual payments.  Defaulted modified 
credit card loans remain in the modification program and 
continue to be charged off in accordance with  the Firm’s 
standard charge-off policy. Notes to consolidated financial statements

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, 
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to 
high-net-worth individuals.
The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is 
the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings 
are used to identify the credit quality of loans and 
differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans 
consider the  PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a 
loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan 
that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and 
takes into consideration collateral and structural support 
for each credit facility.  
Management considers several factors to determine an 
appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt 
capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s 
earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level 
and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the 
industry and geography in which the obligor operates.  The 
Firm’s  internal risk ratings generally align with the 
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the 
economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, 
however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) 
may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and 
assumptions.  The Firm  generally considers internal ratings 
with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or 
higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower 
PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.  Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as 
noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is 
further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, 
representing management’s assessment of the collectibility 
of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD 
than noncriticized loans.  The Firm’s definition of criticized 
aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of 
criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, 
substandard and doubtful categories.   
Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by 
Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for 
updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill 
its obligations.
As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the 
industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As 
part of the overall credit risk management framework,  the 
Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its 
industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid 
to industries with actual or potential credit concern. Refer 
to Note  4 for further detail on industry concentrations.

Note  13 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of  the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
•the allowance for loan losses, which covers  the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,  
•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and  
•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is recognized within  investment securities on th e 
Consolidated balance sheets.  
The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance 
for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit 
losses. 
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit 
losses is complex and requires significant judgment by 
management about the effect of matters that are inherently 
uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses 
is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of  the 
Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, 
considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and 
other factors then prevailing, may result in significant 
changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods.  
The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan 
losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments 
are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note  10 
for a description of the policies used to determine the 
allowance for credit losses on investment securities.  
Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-
related commitments
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-
related commitments represents expected credit losses 
over the remaining expected life of retained loans and 
lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally 
cancellable.  The Firm does not record an allowance for 
future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related 
commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to 
accrued interest on credit card loans and certain 
performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by 
COVID-19 are considered in  the Firm’s allowance for loan 
losses. However,  the Firm does not record an allowance on 
other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write  
these receivables off no later than  90 days past due by 
reversing interest income.  
The expected life of each instrument is determined by 
considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, 
cancellation features, and certain extension and call 
options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is 
generally estimated by considering expected future 
payments on the credit card account, and determining how 
much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) 
versus other account activity. This allocation is made using 
an approach that incorporates the payment application 
requirements of the Credit Card Accountability 
Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying 
down the highest interest rate balances first.  
The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to 
be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative 
allowance.  
Collective and Individual Assessments
When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance for lending-related commitments,  the Firm 
assesses whether exposures share similar risk 
characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist,  the Firm 
estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering 
the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability 
that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or 
default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to 
significant management judgment. Emphasizing one 
characteristic over another or considering additional 
characteristics could affect the allowance.  
•Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio 
include product type, delinquency status, current FICO 
scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized 
loans, current LTV ratios.   
•Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio 
include LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency status, 
level and type of collateral, industry, credit enhancement, 
product type, facility purpose, tenor, and payment terms.  
The majority of  the Firm’s credit exposures share risk 
characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result 
are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based 
component”). The portfolio-based component covers 
consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain 
lending-related commitments.  
If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other 
exposures,  the Firm generally estimates expected credit 
losses on an individual basis, considering expected 
repayment and conditions impacting that individual 
exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific 
component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or 
reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-
dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been 
placed on nonaccrual status.  
Portfolio-based component
The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative 
calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower 
changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating 
to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected 
credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is 
estimated by applying credit loss factors to  the Firm’s 
estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors 
incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as 
loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using Notes to consolidated financial statements
248 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
a weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast 
period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation 
to revert to long run historical information for periods 
beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five 
macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, re lative 
adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme 
upside scenario, and are updated by  the Firm’s central 
forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration  the 
Firm’s  macroeconomic  outlook, i nternal perspectives from 
subject matter experts across  the Firm , and market 
consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates 
feedback from senior management  across LOBs, Corporate 
Finance and Risk Management.
The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are 
accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss 
experience, including during stressed periods, for each 
major product or model. Management applies judgment in 
making this adjustment, including taking into account 
uncertainties associated with the economic and political 
conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower 
behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an 
industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant 
internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of 
the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships 
between these factors create further uncertainties.
The application of different inputs into the quantitative 
calculation, and the assumptions used by management to 
adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant 
management judgment, and emphasizing one input or 
assumption over another, or considering other inputs or 
assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for 
loan losses and the allowance for lending-related 
commitments.
Asset-specific component  
To determine the asset-specific component of the 
allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those 
loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, 
nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio 
segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller 
loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for 
evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of 
assets.  
The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as 
the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and 
the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, 
discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. 
Subsequent changes in impairment are generally 
recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan 
losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of 
collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine 
the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the 
amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or 
the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated 
with improvements in the fair value of collateral). 
The asset-specific component of the allowance for loans 
that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs 
incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s 
expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal 
forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the 
potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans 
modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs,  the Firm 
develops product-specific probability of default estimates, 
which are applied at a loan level to compute expected 
losses. In developing these probabilities of default,  the Firm 
considers the relationship between the credit quality 
characteristics of the underlying loans and certain 
assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, 
based upon industry-wide data.  The Firm also considers its 
own historical loss experience to-date based on actual 
redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified 
in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses 
incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based 
on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification 
program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be 
modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate 
management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to 
repay under the modified terms.  
Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is 
highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon 
estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default 
rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the 
amounts and timing of interest or principal payments 
(including any expected prepayments) or other factors that 
are reflective of current and expected market conditions. 
These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as 
the duration of current overall economic conditions, 
industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the 
expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in 
certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these 
estimates and assumptions require significant management 
judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
was $18.7  billion , a decrease from  $30.8  billion  at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 0. The decrease in the allowance for 
credit losses was primarily  driven by improvements in the 
macroeconomic environment, consisting of :
•a $9.5 billion  reduction in consumer, predominantly in 
the credit card portfolio ; and 
•a $2.6 billion  net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs . 
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the 
Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse 
and ups ide scenarios compared to the significant weighting 
that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of 
December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained improvement 
and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite 
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, 
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic 
caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used 
for modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues to 
place reliance on management judgment and make 
adjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser 
extent than in 2020. The allowance  for credit losses of 
$ 1 8 . 7   b i l l i o n reflects remaining uncertainties, including the 
potential impact that additional waves or variants of 
COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and 
near-term supply chain disruptions.The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and year over year growth in U.S. real 
GDP as follows:
Assumptions at December 31, 2021
2Q22 4Q22 2Q23
U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.2 %  4.0 %  3.9 %

U.S. unemployment rate(a) 6.8 %  5.7 %  5.1 %
YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 9.2 %  3.5 %  3.9 %
(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.
(b)As of December 31, 2021, the year over year growth in U.S. real GDP 
in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the 
percent change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. This year 
over year growth rate replaces the previously disclosed pandemic-
focused measure of the cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from pre-
pandemic conditions at December 31, 2019. Prior periods have been 
revised to conform with the current presentation.  
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future
periods.

The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and  Firm -sponsored), but to a lesser extent, 
as follows:  
•Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the 
funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively 
priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable 
interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.
•Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spect rum of clients, including certain 
third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and 
does not consolidate these entities.  CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally 
limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-
party transaction.  
•Corporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally 
subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including 
VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of 
VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant 
activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the 
Firm’s investment securities portfolio.
In addition,  CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties.  Refer to pages 
257-258  of this Note  for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs sponsored by third 
parties.
Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities
Credit card securitizations
CCB’s Card business may securitize originated credit card 
loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the 
“Trust”).  The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card 
securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining 
an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining 
certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining 
escrow accounts.  
The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its 
sponsored credit card trusts as it is  considered to be the 
primary beneficiary of these  securitization trusts based on  
the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs 
through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, 
including making decisions as to the receivables that are 
transferred into those trusts and as to any related 
modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of  the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the 
trusts, as indicated above, obligates  the Firm to absorb 
losses and gives  the Firm the right to receive certain 
benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be 
significant.  
The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other 
assets of the securitization trusts are available only for 
payment of the beneficial interests issued by the 
securitization trusts; they are not available to pay  the Firm’s 
other obligations or the claims of  the Firm’s creditors.  
The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts 
require  the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest 
in the credit card trusts (generally  5%). As of  
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , the Firm held undivided 
interests in  Firm- sponsored credit card securitization trusts 
of $7.1 billion  and $5.4 billion , respectively.  The Firm 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 253
maintained an average undivided interest in principal 
receivables owned by those trusts of approximately  57%  
and 39%  for the years ended  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020 , respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior 
securities and retained  $1.5 billion  of subordinated 
securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at 
both  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 . The Firm’s undivided 
interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are 
eliminated in consolidation.  Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and 
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages 
and other consumer loans  primarily in its CCB and CIB 
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well 
as the respective business involved,  the Firm may act as the 
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial 
interests in the securitization trusts.
The following table s present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in  Firm -sponsored private-label securitization 
entities, including those in which  the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by  the Firm. Continuing 
involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be 
held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain 
instances,  the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans.  The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and 
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interest s.

254 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
Residential mortgage
The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated 
by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased 
from third parties  by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally 
retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans  it 
originated or purchased , and for certain mortgage loans 
purchased by  CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by  
CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant 
activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions 
related to loan modifications and workouts.  CCB may also 
retain an interest upon securitization.
In addition,  CIB engages in underwriting and trading 
activities involving securities issued by Firm -sponsored 
securitization trusts. As a result,  CIB at times retains senior 
and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests 
and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at 
the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the 
secondary market in the normal course of business. In 
certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or 
reacquired by  CIB or held by  Treasury and CIO or CCB, when 
considered together with the servicing arrangements 
entered into by  CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary 
beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. 
The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage 
securitizations  (Firm -sponsored or third-party-sponsored) 
when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the 
power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) 
or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could 
potentially be significant to the trust.
Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations
CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, 
and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving 
the securities issued by securitization trusts.  CIB may retain 
unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including 
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at 
the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not 
service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO 
may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For 
commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct 
the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the 
servicer or investors in a specified class of securities 
(“controlling class”).  The Firm generally does not retain an 
interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial 
mortgage securitization transactions.
Re-securitizations
The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in 
which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange 
for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in 
connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency 
sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. 
The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on 
the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.The following table presents the principal amount of 
securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.
Year ended December 31, 
(in millions) 2021 2020 2019
Transfers of securities to VIEs
U.S. GSEs and government 
agencies $ 53,923 $ 46,123 $ 25,852 
Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are 
client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group 
of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For 
these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the 
decision-making power of the entity is shared between the 
Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and 
decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its 
assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client 
holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does 
not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.
The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re-
securitization VIEs during 2021, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively, and retained interests in any such Firm-
sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 202 1 and 2020 were 
immaterial .
Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of 
third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally 
purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these 
circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability 
to direct the most significant activities of the re-
securitization trust, either because it was not involved in 
the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with 
an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated 
shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the 
Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-
securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-
securitization VIEs.
Multi-seller conduits
Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy 
remote entities that provide secured financing, 
collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial 
assets, to customers of  the Firm. The conduits fund their 
financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated 
commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the 
commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. 
In most instances, the assets are structured with deal-
specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by 
the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-
specific credit enhancements are generally structured to 
cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of 
assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization 
provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit 
enhancements mitigate  the Firm’s potential losses on its 
agreements with the conduits.
To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and 
to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to 
customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain 
funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool 
financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-
specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by  
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also 
provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted 
program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit 
enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The 
amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is 
based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates  
10%  of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.
The Firm consolidates its  Firm -administered multi-seller 
conduits, as  the Firm has both the power to direct the 
significant activities of the conduits and a potentially 
significant economic interest in the conduits. As 
administrative agent and in its role in structuring 
transactions,  the Firm makes decisions regarding asset 
types and credit quality, and manages the commercial 
paper funding needs of the conduits.  The Firm’s interests 
that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the 
fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and 
program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the 
potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit 
enhancement facilities provided to the conduits .In the normal course of business,  JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by  the 
Firm -administered multi-seller conduits.  The Firm held 
$13.7 billion  and $13.5 billion  of the commercial paper 
issued by  the Firm -administered multi-seller conduits at  
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively, which have 
been eliminated in consolidation.  The Firm’s investments 
reflect  the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not 
driven by market illiquidity.  Other than the amounts 
required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules,  
the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase 
the commercial paper issued by  the Firm -administered 
multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and 
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been 
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related 
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were   
$13.4 billion  and $12.2 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020 , respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments in other unfunded 
commitments to extend credit.  Refer to Note  28 for more 
information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments.  
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB 
transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal 
bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing 
two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate 
certificates (“flo aters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate 
residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically 
purchased by money market funds or other short-term 
investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the 
TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor 
seeking to finance its municipal bond investment.  TOB 
transactions where the residual is held by a third-party 
investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and 
non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the 
Residual is retained by  the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are 
sponsored by a third party . The Firm serves as sponsor for 
all non-customer TOB transactions.  The Firm may provide 
various services to a TOB trust, including  remarketing 
agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing 
agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent 
is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on 
the floaters, conducting the initial placement and 
remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, 
but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters 
held by the Fi rm were not material during 2021  and 2020 .
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 
often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider 
for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to Notes to consolidated financial statements
256 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
perform is conditional and is limited by certain events 
(“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure 
to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement 
provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or 
the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below 
investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s 
exposure is typically further limited by the high credit 
quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess 
collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, 
the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters 
to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot 
successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the 
liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for 
the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly 
purchases the tendered floaters.  
TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities.  
The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as 
the Residual holder,  the Firm has the right to make 
decisions that significantly impact the economic 
performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the 
right to receive benefits and bear losses that could 
potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.

“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the 
general credit of JPMorgan Chase . Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $2.6 billion  and $5.2 billion  at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively.
(f)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets .
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 257
VIEs sponsored by third parties  
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by 
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a 
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee 
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the 
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying assets. Where  the Firm does not 
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a 
variable interest that could potentially be significant,  the 
Firm generally  does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance 
sheets in the same manner it would record and report 
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.  
Tax credit vehicles  
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit 
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities 
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other 
projects.  These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A 
third party is typically the general partner or managing 
member and has control over the significant activities of the 
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly  the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles.  The Firm generally invests in 
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return 
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the 
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by 
equity investments and funding commitments, was  $26.8 
billion  and $23.6 billion , of which  $9.4 billion  and $8.7 
billion  was unfunded at  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , 
respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure 
amount has been revised to conform with the current 
presentation.  The Firm assesses each project and to reduce 
the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital 
investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer 
to Note  25 for further information on affordable housing 
tax credits.  Refer to Note  28 for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments.  
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)  
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB 
trusts, including  remarketing agent, liquidity or tender 
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,  the 
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a 
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In 
those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,  the 
Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for 
any shortfall.  The Firm does not have any intent to protect 
Residual  holders from potential losses on any of the 
underlying municipal bonds.  The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since  the Firm does not have the 
power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.  The 
Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to 
customer TOB trusts at  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , was 
$6.8 billion  and $6.7 billion , respectively. The fair value of 
assets held by such VIEs at  both  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 
2020  was $10.5 billion . Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mortgage s, credit card receivables, 
and commercial mortgages. The purposes of these 
securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand 
and to generate liquidity for  the Firm.
For loan securitizations in which  the Firm is not required to 
consolidate the trust,  the Firm records the transfer of the 
loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the 
following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the 
transferred financial assets are legally isolated from  the 
Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest 
holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial 
assets; and (3)  the Firm does not maintain effective control 
over the transferred financial assets (e.g.,  the Firm cannot 
repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and 
it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder 
to return the transferred assets).
For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale,  the Firm 
recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between 
the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial 
interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying 
value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations 
are reported in noninterest revenue.Notes to consolidated financial statements

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization 
activity tables above,  the Firm, in the normal course of 
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans 
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, 
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs 
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the 
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans).  The Firm also sells loans 
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae 
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed 
by another U.S. government agency.  The Firm does not 
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these 
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a 
limited number of loan sales,  the Firm is obligated to share 
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note  28 for additional 
information about  the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-
related indemnifications.  Refer to Note  15 for additional

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to  the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain 
loans due to material breaches of representations and 
warranties as discussed in Note  28, the Firm also has the 
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for 
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government 
agencies under certain arrangements.  The Firm typically 
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the 
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable 
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or 
guaranteed. When  the Firm’s repurchase option becomes 
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding 
liability.  Refer to Note  12 for additional information.  
The following table presents loans  the Firm repurchased or 
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and 
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage 
loans recognized on  the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets

Note 15 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business 
combination as the difference between the purchase price 
and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and can be 
adjusted up to one year from the acquisition date as more 
information is obtained about the fair value of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for 
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or 
more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse 
changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be 
an impairment.
The goodw ill associated with each business combination is 
allocated to the related reporting units, which are generally 
determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are 
managed and how they are reviewed.  The follow ing table 
presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business

Goodwill impairment testing
The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 
2021, 2020 and 2019 .
Effective January 1, 2020,  the Firm adopt ed new 
accounting guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. 
The adoption of the guidance requires recognition of an 
impairment loss when the estimated fair value of a 
reporting unit falls below its carrying value. It eliminated 
the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below 
its carrying value . 
The goodwill impairment test is generally performed by 
comparing the current fair value of  each reporting unit with 
its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the 
carrying value, then the  reporting unit’s goodwill is 
considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than 
the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized 
for the amount by which the  reporting unit’s carrying value 
exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of  goodwill  
allocated to that reporting unit. 
The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus 
goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the 
carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the 
goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is 
determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to 
the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors 
including capital levels of similarly rated peers and 
applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB 
capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual 
budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of 
Directors. Allocated capital is further reviewed periodically 
and updated as needed.
The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value 
of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach 
projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the 
perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. 
These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted 
using an appropriate discount rate. Projections of cash 
flows are based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts 
which are reviewed with senior management of the Firm. 
The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents 
an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and 
is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost 
of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), 
as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each 
reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or 
uncertainty associated with the business or management’s 
forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness 
of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, 
management compares the discount rate to the estimated 
cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar 
businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the 
weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various 
reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall 
estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The 
valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis 
are then compared with market-based trading and 
transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and 
transaction comparables are used as general indicators to 
assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair 
values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be 
drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between 
the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. 
Management also takes into consideration a comparison 
between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 261
units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In 
evaluating this comparison, management considers several 
factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a 
market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of 
execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do 
not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term 
market volatility and other factors that do not directly 
affect the value of individual reporting units.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases 
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as 
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse 
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the 
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated 
fair values of  the Firm’s reporting units  to decline in the 
future, which could result in a material impairment charge 
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill.  Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows 
for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value 
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary 
revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and 
generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are 
received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against 
contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are 
either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale 
or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.
As permitted by U.S. GAAP,  the Firm has elected to account 
for its MSRs at fair value.  The Firm treats its MSRs as a 
single class of servicing assets based on the availability of 
market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR 
asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for 
risk management purposes.  The Firm estimates the fair 
value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) 
model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest 
rate scenarios in conjunction with  the Firm’s prepayment 
model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted 
rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, 
contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment 
assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late 
charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic 
factors.  The Firm  compares fair value estimates and 
assumptions to observable market data where available, 
and also considers recent market activity and actual 
portfolio experience.  Notes to consolidated financial statements
262 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest 
rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs 
typically decrease in value when interest rates decline 
because declining interest rates tend to increase 
prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the 
net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. 
Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), 
and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which  the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value 
when interest rates decline.  JPMorgan Chase uses 
combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the 
risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to 
offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of 
MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk 
management instruments.

advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right 
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if 
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.
(e)The decrease in projected cash flows was largely related to default servicing assumption updates.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions 
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the 
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change 
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be 
linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular 
assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without 
changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one 
factor may result in changes in another, which would either 
magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 16 – Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment, including leasehold 
improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and amortization.  JPMorgan Chase  computes 
depreciation using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold 
improvements,  the Firm uses the straight-line method 
computed over the lesser of the remainder of the lease 
term, or estimated useful life of the improvements.  
JPMorgan Chase  capitalizes certain costs associated with 
the acquisition or development of internal-use software. 
Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs 
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s 
expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an 
ongoing basis.  Note 17 – Deposits

Note 18 - Leases
Firm as lessee
At Decembe r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 , JPMorgan Chase and its 
subsidiaries were obligated under a number of 
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for 
premises and equipment used primarily for business 
purposes. These leases generally have terms of  20 years  or 
less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the 
lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or 
terminate the lease when  the Firm is reasonably certain 
that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease 
terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease 
liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. 
None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on  the 
Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity 
financing transactions or enter into further lease 
agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation 
clauses that will increase rental payments based on 
maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease 
components.  The Firm elected not to separate lease and 
non-lease components of a contract for its real estate 
leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent 
payments on both lease and non-lease components.  
Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at 
the lease commencement date based on the present value 
of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. 
The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that 
represents  the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for 
financing instruments of a similar term and are included in 
accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease 
ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also 
includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct 
costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental 
expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally 
included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated 
statements of income.  The following tables provide information related to  the 
Firm’s operating leases:

Firm as lessor
The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its 
customers through lease arrangements with lease terms 
that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase 
options. The Firm’s lease financings are predominantly auto 
operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases 
are recognized in other assets on  the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated 
residual value. Depreciation expense is included in 
technology, communications and equipment expense in the 
Consolidated statements of income.  The Firm’s lease 
income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term and is included in other income in the 
Consolidated statements of income.  
On a periodic basis,  the Firm assesses leased assets for 
impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset 
exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease 
payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition 
of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized.  
The risk  of loss on auto and equipment leased assets 
relating to the residual value of the leased assets is 
monitored through projections of the asset residual values 
at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, 
and is mitigated through arrangements with certain 
manufacturers or lessees.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 269
The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total 
long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at 
fair value were  2.67%  and 2.89%  as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  
2021  and 2020 , respectively. In order to modify exposure 
to interest rate  and currency exchange rate movements,  
JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily 
interest rate  and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in 
conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of 
these instruments modifies  the Firm’s interest expense on 
the associated debt. The modified weighted-average 
interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects 
of related derivative instruments, were  1.43%  and 1.59%  
as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively.  
JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term 
debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These 
guarantees rank on parity with the Firm’s other unsecured 
and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such 
guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $16.4 
billion  and $13.8 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , 
respectively. 
The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements 
that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities 
or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any 
limitations on future borrowings or require additional 
collateral, based on unfavorable changes in  the Firm’s 
credit ratings, financial ratios , earnings  or stock price.Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 21 – Preferred stock
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , JPMorgan Chase  was authorized to issue 200 million  shares of preferred stock, in one or

Note 22 – Common stock
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , JPMorgan Chase  was 
authorized to issue 9.0 billion  shares of common stock with 
a par value of $1 per share.

On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced 
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share 
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. 
Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of 
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase 
program for up to $ 3 0   b i l l i o n. As directed by the Federal 
Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends 
in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and 
could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for 
the four preceding calendar quarters.
On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the 
temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire 
on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above 
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the 
2021 CCAR stress test.  Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm 
became subject to the normal capital distribution 
restrictions provided under the regulatory capital 
framework. The Firm continues to be authorized to 
repurchase common shares under its existing common 
share repurchase program previously approved by the 
Board of Directors.The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of 
common stock for the years ended  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 
2020  and 2019 .

Aggregate purchase price of common

(a)On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended 
repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve 
directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share 
repurchases through the end of 2020.
The authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized 
at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases 
and the exact amount of common shares that may be 
repurchased is subject to various factors, including market 
conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the 
amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital 
position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); 
internal capital generation; and alternative investment 
opportunities. The repurchase program does not include 
specific price targets or timetables; may be suspended by 
management at any time; and may be executed through 
open market purchases or privately negotiated 
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are 
written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from 
time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its 
common shares during periods when it may otherwise not 
be repurchasing common shares —for example, during 
internal trading blackout periods.
As of D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, approximately 58.3 million  
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under 
various employee incentive, compensation, option and 
stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans.

Note 23 – Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the 
two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings 
(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common 
stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase  grants 
RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, 
predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive 
nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a 
basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s 
common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of 
participating securities based on their respective rights to 
receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a 
separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. 
Participating securities are not included as incremental 
shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for 
additional information.
Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of 
contingently issuable shares, including awards which 
require future service as a condition of delivery of the 
underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under 
both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the 
more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods 
presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under 
the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table presents the calculation of net income 
applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted 
EPS for the years ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 2020  and

Note 25 – Income tax es 
JPMorgan Chase  and its eligible subsidiaries file a 
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan 
Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide income 
taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. This method requires that income 
taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, 
a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary 
difference is determined based on the tax rates that the 
Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of 
income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s 
expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred 
portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is 
established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the 
Firm expects to realize.
Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of  
the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and 
being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, 
significant judgments and estimates are required to be 
made. Agreement of tax liabilities between  JPMorgan Chase 
and the many tax jurisdictions in which  the Firm files tax 
returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus,  the 
Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately 
be different from those currently reported.
In the first quarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified certain 
deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and 
other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the 
carrying value of the associated tax-oriented investments. 
The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income 
tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, 
with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have 
been revised to conform with the current presentation, 
including the Firm’s effective income tax rate.

Affordable housing tax credits
The Firm  recognized  $1.7 billion  of tax credits and other tax 
benefits associated with investments in affordable housing 
projects  within income tax expense for the year ended  
2021 , and $1.5 billion  in each of the years ended 2020  and 
2019 . The amount of amortization of such investments 
reported in income tax expense was  $1.3 billion , $1.2 
billion  and $1.1 billion , respectively. The carrying value of 
these investments, which are reported in other assets on  
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was  $10.8 billion  
and $9.7 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , 
respectively. The amount of commitments related to these 
investments, which are reported in accounts payable and 
other liabilities on  the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, 
was $4.6 billion  and $3.8 billion  at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 
and 2020 , respectively.  Deferred taxes  
Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from 
differences between assets and liabilities measured for 
financial reporting purposes versus income tax return 
purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in 
management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to 
be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is 
determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is 
established. The significant components of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table.

federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards and other tax 
attributes, FTC carryforwards, and state and local capital 
loss carryforwards. At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, total U.S. 
federal NOL carryforwards were $972 million , non-U.S. NOL 
carryforwards were $210 million , FTC carryforwards were 
$258 million , state and local capital loss carryforwards 
were $1.1 billion , and other U.S. federal tax attributes were 
$359 million .   I f  n o t  u t i l i z e d ,  a  p o r t i o n  o f  t h e  U . S .  f e d e r a l  
NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax attributes will 
expire between 2026 and 2037 whereas others have an 
unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. 
NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2036 
whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The 
FTC carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2030, and 
the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire in 
2 0 2 2 .   
The valuation allowance at D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, was due to 
the state and local capital loss carryforwards, FTC 
carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, 
including NOL carryforwards.Notes to consolidated financial statements

Unrecognized tax benefits
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 2020  and 2019 , JPMorgan Chase ’s 
unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest 
expense and penalties, were  $4.6 billion , $4.3 billion  and 
$4.0 billion , respectively, of which  $3.4 billion , $3.1 billion  
and $2.8 billion , respectively, if recognized, would reduce 
the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not 
affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the 
Consolidated statements of income.  These unrecognized 
items include the tax effect of certain temporary 
differences, the portion of gross state and local 
unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the 
benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, 
and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits 
that would have offsets in other jurisdictions.  JPMorgan 
Chase  is presently under audit by a number of taxing 
authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service as 
summarized in the Tax examination status table below.  As 
JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of 
taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that over the 
next 12 months the resolution of these examinations may 
increase or decrease the gross balance of unrecognized tax 
benefits by as much as approximately  $300 million . Upon 
settlement of an audit, the change in the unrecognized tax 
benefit would result from payment or income statement 
recognition.  
The following table presents a reconciliation of the 
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

to income tax liabilities recognized in income tax expense 
were  $174 million , $147 million  and $(52) million  in 2021 , 
2020  and 2019 , respectively.
At D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , in addition to the liability 
for unrecognized tax benefits,  the Firm had accrued  $1.1 
billion  and $1.0 billion , respectively, for income tax-related 
interest and penaltie s. Tax examination status
JPMorgan Chase  is continually under examination by the 
Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout 
the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions 
throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the

assets and intercompany funds transfers 
Restricted cash and other restricted assets 
Certain of  the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as 
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by 
various regulatory authorities based on the particular 
activities of  the Firm’s subsidiaries.  
The business of  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  is subject to 
examination and regulation by the  OCC. The Bank is a 
member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its 
deposits in the U.S. are insured by the  FDIC , subject to 
applicable limits.  
The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain 
non-US central banks.  
The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established 
by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators.  As part of its 
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements,  
the Firm’s broker-dealer  activities are  subject to certain 
restrictions on cash and other assets. 
The following table presents the components of the Firm’s

customer activity.Intercompany funds transfers 
Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit  JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to 
JPMorgan Chase  & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of 
its affiliates  unless the loans are secured in specified 
amounts. Such secured loans  provided by any banking 
subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular 
affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such 
affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”),  
must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent 
with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless 
collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations , 
covered transactions are generally limited to  10%  of the 
banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-
based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered 
transactions between  any banking subsidiary and all of its 
affiliates is limited to 20%  of the banking subsidiary’s total 
capital.
The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings 
LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC 
generally holds the stock of JPMorgan  Chase’s subsidiaries 
other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. 
The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany 
loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is 
obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net 
proceeds received from securities issuances (including 
issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of 
preferred and common stock).
The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent 
Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In 
addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and 
regulations,  the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have 
authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to 
prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking 
organizations they supervise, including  the Parent Company 
and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding 
companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment 
of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound 
practice in light of the financial condition of the banking 
organization.  The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or 
extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or 
liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise 
imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of 
Directors.
At J a n u a r y   1 ,  2 0 2 2 ,  t h e  P a r e n t  C o m p a n y ’ s  b a n k i n g  
subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately  $20 
billion  in dividends to  their respective bank holding 
companies without the prior approval of  their relevant 
banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in  2022  
will be supplemented by  the banking subsidiaries’ earnings 
during the year.Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 27 – Regulatory cap ital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized requirements, for the 
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC 
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and 
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. 
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for  large and 
internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and 
banks , including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  Two comprehensive approaches 
are prescribed for calculating  RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”).  For each of the risk-based 
capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  is evaluated against the lower of 
the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to 
their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.    
The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel 
III rules are as illustrated below:
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines 
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to 
maintain minimum ratios  for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, 
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR . Failure to meet 
these minimum requirements  could cause the Federal 
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to 
these capital requirements  established by their respective 
primary regulators . The following table presents the risk-based  regulatory 
capital ratio requirements  and well-capitalized  ratios to 
which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of  
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .

Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the 
Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI 
subsidiaries are subject.  
(a)Represents the regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable to the 
Firm.  The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements each 
include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 
3.5%  as calculated under Method 2;  plus a 3.2%  SCB for Basel III 
Standardized ratios and  a fixed  2.5%  capital conservation buffer for 
Basel III Advanced ratios.  The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 
0% by the federal banking agencies.
(b)For the period ended December 31, 2020, the CET1, Tier 1, and Total 
capital ratio requirements under Basel III Standardized applicable to 
the Firm were 11.3% , 12.8%  and 14.8% , respectively.
(c)Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The 
CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital 
conservation buffer requirement of  2.5%  that is applicable to the IDI 
subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.
(d)Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to 
regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.  
(e)Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations

Current Expected Credit Losses
The Firm elected to apply the CECL capital transition 
provisions as permitted by the federal banking agencies 
delaying  the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two 
years until January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year 
transition period  (“CECL capital transition provisions”). 
As of December 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm 
reflected the benefit of the CECL capital transition provisions of $ 2 . 9   b i l l i o n, which will be phased in at 25%

Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and 
other commitments
JPMorgan Chase  provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address 
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The 
contractual amount of these financial instruments 
represents the maximum possible credit risk to  the Firm 
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment 
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the 
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most 
of these commitments and guarantees have historically 
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total 
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in  the 
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit 
exposure or funding requirements.  To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 
is maintained.  Refer to Note  13 for further information 
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments . The following table summarizes the 
contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance 
sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and 
other commitments at  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 . The 
amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity 
lending-related commitments represent the total available 
credit for these products.  The Firm has not experienced, 
and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for 
these products will be utilized at the same time.  The Firm 
can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing 
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, 
without notice.  In addition,  the Firm typically closes credit 
card lines when the borrower is  60 days  or more past due.  
The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are 
significant decreases in the value of the underlying 
property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in 
the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit  
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally 
consist of commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support 
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event 
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new 
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing 
organizations.  The Firm also issues commitments under 
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in 
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of 
credit.  
Guarantees  
U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the 
inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to 
the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the 
guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that 
contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed 
party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, 
liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a 
third party’s failure to perform under a specified 
agreement.  The Firm considers the following off–balance 
sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: 
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, 
securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification 
agreements included within third-party contractual 
arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the 
guarantees under the sponsored member repo program.  
As required by U.S. GAAP,  the Firm initially records 
guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-
contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of 
consideration received or the net present value of the 
premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm 
records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an 
offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium 
receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is 
received under the contract, and the fair value of the 
liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as 
lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the 
guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent 
obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in 
addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent 
obligation.
Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized 
when the liability becomes probable and reasonably 
estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the 
estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any 
non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted 
for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related 
contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in 
sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is 
allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss 
that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these 
indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income 
as the Firm’s  risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the 
indemnification expires).
The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees 
and indemnifications are included in the table on page 284.
For additional information on the guarantees, see below.  
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees  
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are 
conditional lending commitments issued by  the Firm to 
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a 
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial 
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, 
trade  financings and similar transactions.  
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .

Securities lending indemnifications  
Through  the Firm’s securities lending program, 
counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial 
arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this 
program,  the Firm provides an indemnification in the 
lending agreements which protects the lender against the 
failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To 
minimize its liability under these indemnification 
agreements,  the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid 
collateral with a market value exceeding  100%  of the value 
of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is 
marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization 
is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the 
borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released 
to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a 
borrower defaults,  the Firm would use the collateral held to 
purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit 
the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent 
thereof.  
The cash collateral held by  the Firm may be invested on 
behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, 
whereby  the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of 
principal invested. To minimize its liability under these 
agreements,  the Firm obtains collateral with a market value 
exceeding  100%  of the principal invested.
Derivatives qualifying as guarantees  
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have 
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These 
contracts include written put options that require  the Firm 
to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a 
specified price by a specified date in the future.  The Firm 
may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet 
client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of 
written put options are typically  five years  or less. 
Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable 
value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value 
products”, that require  the Firm to make a payment of the 
difference between the market value and the book value of 
a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event 
that market value is less than book value and certain other 
conditions have been met. Stable value products are 
transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment 
returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. 
These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no 
stated maturity, but allow  the Firm to elect to terminate the 
contract under certain conditions.  
The notional value of derivat ive guar antees generally 
represents  the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, 
exposure to certain stable value products is contractually 
limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional 
amount.  
The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the 
probability, in  the Firm’s view, of whether  the Firm will be 
required to perform under the contract.  The Firm reduces 
exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting 
transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the 
market risk related to the derivative guarantees.  The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying 
as guarantees as of  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 .

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee,  the Firm is both a purchaser 
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives 
market. Refer to  Note 5 for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives.  
Unsettled securities financing agreements  
In the normal course of business,  the Firm enters into resale 
and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these 
commitments result in  the Firm advancing cash to and 
receiving securities collateral from the counterparty.  The 
Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned 
agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in  the 
Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral 
to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future 
date. These agreements generally do not meet the 
definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded 
on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. 
These agreements predominantly have regular-way 
settlement terms. Refer to Note  11 for a further discussion 
of securities financing agreements.  
Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications  
Mortgage repurchase liability  
In connection with  the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made 
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet 
certain requirements, and that may require  the Firm to 
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan 
purchaser if such representations and warranties are 
breached by  the Firm. 
Private label securitizations
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with 
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by  the 
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.  
Refer to Note  30 for additional information regarding 
litigation.  
Loans sold with recourse  
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain 
commercial lending products on both a recourse and 
nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal 
credit risk to  the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing 
advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In 
recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk Notes to consolidated financial statements
286 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae 
or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. 
Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when 
foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a 
defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding 
principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the 
cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property.  
The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, 
thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit 
losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities 
issued by the trust. At  D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , the 
unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled  
$827 million  and $889 million , respectively. The carrying 
value of the related liability that  the Firm has recorded in 
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets, which is representative of  the Firm’s view of 
the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse 
obligations, was  $19 million  and $23 million  at 
D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1 and 2020 , respectively.  
Other off-balance sheet arrangements  
Indemnification agreements – general  
In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the 
U.S.,  the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the 
holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change 
in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed 
on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities 
may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if 
such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also 
enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the 
licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or 
when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third-
party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies 
software licensees for claims of liability or damages that 
may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or 
third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to 
actions taken by  the Firm prior to the sale of the business or 
assets. It is difficult to estimate  the Firm’s maximum 
exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since 
this would require an assessment of future changes in tax 
law and future claims that may be made against  the Firm 
that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical 
experience, management expects the risk of loss to be 
remote.  
Merchant charge-backs   
Under the rules of payment networks,  the Firm, in its role as 
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for 
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that 
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is 
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will 
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the 
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the 
transaction to the merchant.  If Merchant Services is unable 
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services 
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the 
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by 
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve 
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that cover s the 
payment or performance risk to  the Firm related to charge-
backs. 
For the years ended D e c e m b e r   3 1 ,  2 0 2 1, 2020  and 2019 , 
Merchant Services processed an aggregate volume of 
$1,886.7 billion , $1,597.3 billion , and $1,511.5 billion , 
respectively.
Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk  
The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering 
into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts 
with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as 
well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing 
member,  the Firm stands behind the performance of its 
clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as 
well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and 
remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. 
There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted 
on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative 
contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a 
derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential 
changes in the variation margin requirement for the 
contract.  
As a clearing member,  the Firm is exposed to the risk of 
nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for 
the performance of the CCPs. Where possible,  the Firm 
seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection 
of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and 
throughout the life of the transactions.  The Firm can also 
cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to 
their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event 
of nonperformance by a client,  the Firm would close out the 
client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP 
would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with 
any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by  the Firm as 
a clearing member.  
The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the 
client through the recognition of margin receivables from 
clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying 
securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in  the 
Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
It is difficult to estimate  the Firm’s maximum possible 
exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this 
would require an assessment of transactions that clients 
may execute in the future. However, based upon historical 
experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to  the 
Firm, management believes it is unlikely that  the Firm will 
have to make any material payments under these 
arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.  
Refer to Note  5 for information on the derivatives that  the 
Firm executes for its own account and records in its 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other 
countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. 
Membership in some of these organizations requires  the 
Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the 
organization as a result of the default of another member. 
Such obligations vary with different organizations. These 
obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of 
the amount) of  the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee 
fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of 
the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a 
member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also 
include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying 
the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses 
require  the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of 
losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment 
of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, 
unrelated to and independent of the default of another 
m e m b e r .   G e n e r a l l y  a  p a y m e n t  w o u l d  o n l y  b e  r e q u i r e d  
should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing 
house or exchange that are contractually required to 
absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is 
difficult to estimate  the Firm’s maximum possible exposure 
under these membership agreements, since this would 
require an assessment of future claims that may be made 
against  the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, 
based on historical experience, management expects the 
risk of loss to  the Firm to be remote.  Where  the Firm’s 
maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount 
is disclosed in the table on  page 284 , in the Exchange & 
clearing house guarantees and commitments line.   
Sponsored member repo program  
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements 
through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed 
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients 
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.  
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full 
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ 
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm 
minimizes its liability under these  guarantees by  obtaining a 
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities 
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; 
therefore , the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote.  
The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into 
consideration the associated collateral, is included  in the 
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments 
line on  page 284 . Refer to Note  11 for additional 
information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale 
agreements and the types of collateral pledged under 
repurchase agreements.  
Guarantees of subsidiaries 
In the normal course of business,  the Parent Company  may 
provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the 
trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries  on a 
contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with  the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are 
included on  the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are 
reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore,  the 
Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for 
these guarantees.  The Firm believes that the occurrence of 
any event that would trigger payments  by the Parent 
Company under these guarantees is remote.  
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt 
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan 
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100% -owned 
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and 
no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees 
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity 
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated 
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 284  of 
this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 29 – Pledged assets and collateral  
Pledged assets  
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain 
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with 
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and 
FHLBs. Additionally,  the Firm pledges assets for other 
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other 
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to 
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits . Certain of 
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise 
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically 
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets 
pledged.  
The following table presents  the Firm’s pledged assets.

held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative 
contracts.  Collateral is generally used under repurchase and 
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales, 
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 30 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of December 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and 
affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal 
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government 
investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The 
litigations range from individual actions involving a single 
plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of 
class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement 
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by 
both governmental agencies and self-regulatory 
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages 
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve 
each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies 
and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort 
and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and 
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel 
legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of 
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately $1.5 billion  at December 31, 2021. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
was based upon information available as of that date for 
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an 
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For 
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an 
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate 
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
involves significant judgment, given:
•the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
•the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability 
(if any) has yet to be determined, 
•the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
•the attendant uncertainty of the various potential 
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm 
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the 
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or 
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, 
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be 
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may 
vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal 
proceedings. 
Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating J.P.Morgan India Private Limited in connection 
with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore 
funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into 
residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali 
G r o u p  ( “ A m r a p a l i ” ) .   I n  2 0 1 7 ,  n u m e r o u s  c r e d i t o r s  f i l e d  c i v i l  
claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by 
home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to 
deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have 
been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are 
ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. 
Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million . 
The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in 
July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order 
making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other 
parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and 
the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, 
violated certain currency control and money laundering 
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry 
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) 
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 
2020, the ED attached approximately $ 2 5   m i l l i o n from J.P. 
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the 
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and 
c o o p e r a t i n g  w i t h  t h e  P M L A  i n v e s t i g a t i o n .       
Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the 
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major 
international oil companies. The account held 
approximately $1.1 billion  in connection with a dispute 
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the 
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid 
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in 
accordance with directions received from its clients. In 
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) 
commenced a claim in the English High Court for 
approximately $875 million  in payments made out of the 
accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the 
FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a 
complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but 
that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on 
notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was 
unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial commenced in 
February 2022.
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.  The Firm 
previously reported settlements with certain government 
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and 
trading activities and controls related to those activities. 
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded 
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The 
Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year  Notes to consolidated financial statements
290 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its 
affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional 
Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm 
will need the Department of Labor to approve a further 
exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year  
disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only 
remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa 
Competition Commission matter which is currently pending 
before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.
With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a 
consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, 
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws 
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign 
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of 
persons who transacted in FX futures and options on 
futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed 
requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and 
certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other 
foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of 
these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class 
action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign 
exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who 
purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. 
Another putative class action was brought against the Firm 
and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported 
indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court 
approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants 
of that class action for a total of $ 1 0   m i l l i o n. In addition, 
some FX-related individual and putative class actions based 
on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed 
outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the 
Netherlands, Brazil and Australia.
Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . In 
December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered 
into re solutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective 
civil investigations of compliance with records preservation 
requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap 
dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and 
CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain 
copies of certain communications required to be maintained 
under their respective record keeping rules, where such 
communications were sent or received by employees over 
electronic messaging channels that had not been approved 
for employee use  by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also 
included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan 
Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found 
related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC paid a $ 1 2 5   m i l l i o n civil monetary 
penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. M organ Securities plc 
paid a total $ 7 5   m i l l i o n civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. 
The Fi rm continues to respond to requests for information and other material from certain authorities concerning its 
compliance with records preservation requirements in 
connection with business communications sent over 
electronic messaging channels that have not been approved 
by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries.
Interchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging 
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, 
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card 
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of 
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases 
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card 
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card 
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that 
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded 
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
New York for further proceedings consistent with the 
appellate decision.
The original class action was divided into two separate 
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other 
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the 
parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement 
which amends and supersedes the prior settlement 
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants 
collectively contributed an additional $ 9 0 0   m i l l i o n to the 
approximately $ 5 . 3   b i l l i o n previously held in escrow from 
the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended 
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. 
Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval 
order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the 
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended 
class settlement, $ 7 0 0   m i l l i o n has been returned to the 
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with 
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action 
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District 
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in 
part, and denied the motion in part.
In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as 
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those 
actions remain pending.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation . JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from 
various governmental agencies and entities around the 
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s 
("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for 
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s 
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss 
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to 
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, 
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission 
issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding 
an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to 
EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with 
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K 291
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along 
with other banks in various individual and putative class 
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar 
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the 
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has 
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain 
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims 
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the 
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative 
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was 
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been 
dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a 
lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and 
other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement 
to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the 
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. 
Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In 
December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a 
preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from 
setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial 
instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm’s 
settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc 
LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the 
Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill 
Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. 
Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and 
Related Inquiries.  The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions 
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, 
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective 
investigations relating to historical trading practices by 
former employees in the precious metals and U.S. 
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 
2016.
The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a 
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with 
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain 
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms 
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after 
three years , provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully 
comply with all of their obligations.  
Across the three  resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, 
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. 
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary 
amount of approximately $ 9 2 0   m i l l i o n. A portion of the 
total monetary amount includes victim compensation 
payments.
Several putative class action complaints have been filed in 
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, 
alleging a precious metals futures and options price 
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity 
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust 
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the 
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court 
consolidated these putative class actions, and, in December 
2021, the Court preliminarily approved a settlement among 
the parties. In addition, several putative class actions were 
filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern 
District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against 
the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and 
options, and bringing claims under the Commodity 
Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois 
were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The 
Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in 
December 2021, the Court preliminarily approved a 
settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have 
moved to commence putative class action proceedings 
based on similar alleged underlying conduct related to 
precious metals.
In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were 
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New 
York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on 
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the 
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the 
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not 
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these 
putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their 
second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally 
alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures 
contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during 
the putative class period were materially false and 
misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.  
Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, 
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are 
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust 
law and New York State common law in connection with an 
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous 
exchange trading for securities lending transactions. 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. 
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which 
defendants are opposing.
*     *     *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as 
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has 
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to Notes to consolidated financial statements
292 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may 
be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with 
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm 
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable 
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its 
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its 
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $426 million , $1.1 
billion  and $239 million  for the years ended December 31, 
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There is no assurance 
that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be 
adjusted in the future. 
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome 
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek 
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters 
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of 
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot 
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of 
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate 
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or 
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase 
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a 
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial 
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the 
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no 
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently 
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among other 
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level 
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 31 – International operations  
The following table presents income statement and balance 
sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major 
international geographic area. The Firm defines 
international activities for purposes of this footnote 
presentation as business transactions that involve clients 
residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented 
below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, 
the location from which the client relationship is managed, 
booking location or the location of the trading desk. 
However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve 
international businesses.As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates 
and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion 
revenue and expense between U.S. and international 
operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent 
with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting 
as set forth in Note 32.
The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are 
not considered by management to be significant in relation 
to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets 
are located in the U.S.

Segment results 
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 
2021 , 2020  and 2019 , on a managed basis. The Firm’s 
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. 
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax 
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the 
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. This allows management to 
assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year 
arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The 
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt 
items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.Capital allocation
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for 
expected returns are established as key measures of a 
business segment’s performance.
The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III 
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB 
surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress 
environment.  The assumptions and methodologies used to 
allocate capital are periodically reassessed and as a result, 
the capital allocated to the LOBs may change from time to 
t i m e .

The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate 
is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding 
annual rates (refer to pages 300-304  for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change 
cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in 
market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. 
This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, 
the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in 
the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities 
involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

Credit derivatives:  Financial instruments whose value is 
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a 
third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one  
party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to 
another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence 
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, 
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its 
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the 
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the 
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to 
the protection seller for the difference between the face 
value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of 
settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as 
to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by 
the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives

Eligible LTD: Long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility 
criteria
Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of 
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner 
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms 
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of 
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred 
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid 
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument 
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the 
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a 
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, 
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a

LTV: “Loan-to-value”: For residential real estate loans, the 
relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the 
principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the 
collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. 
Origination date LTV ratio  
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination 
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual 
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the 
origination date. 
Current estimated LTV ratio  
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current 
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated 
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home 
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area 
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist 
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data 
where actual data is not available. As a result, the 
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do 
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; 
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise 
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV 
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral 
or margin when due).

capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics, 
and other payments services. Through Merchant Services,

Mortgage origination channels:
Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through 
direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the 
Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone. 
Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by 
a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home 
builders or other third parties.
Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and 
other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm.
Mortgage product types: 
Alt-A 
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A 
lending characteristics may include one or more of the 
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; 
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) 
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial 
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a 
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his 
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. 
Option ARMs 
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the 
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only 
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option 
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the 
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually 
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed 
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once 
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and 
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The 
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest 
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is 
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. 
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which 
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan 
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date 
triggers. 
Prime 
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related 
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage 
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have 
reliable payment histories. 
Subprime 
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a 
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the 
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) 
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

Exchange Act of 1934.
Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge-
offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained 
loans for the reporting period.
Net interchange income includes the following 
components:
•Interchange income : Fees earned by credit and debit 
card issuers on sales transactions. 
•Reward costs : The cost to the Firm for points earned by 
cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs 
generally tied to sales transactions.
•Partner payments : Payments to co-brand credit card 
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards 
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.
Net mortgage servicing revenue: Includes operating 
revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, 
which is recognized over the period in which the service is 
provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of 
risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains 
and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. 
Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and 
losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments 
of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government 
agencies. 
Net revenue rate: Represents Credit Card net revenue 
(annualized) expressed as a percentage of average loans 
for the period.
Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for

NM: Not meaningful
NOL:  Net operating loss

recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. Glossary of Terms and Acronyms
308 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status 
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and 
interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or 
more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the 
process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are 
typically maintained on nonaccrual status. 
Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain 
assets acquired in loan satisfaction, predominantly real 
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives: Derivative contracts 
that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally 
between two derivative counterparties, where one or both 
counterparties is a derivatives dealer. 
Over-the-counter cleared (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives: 
Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed 
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing 
house, such that each derivative counterparty is only 
exposed to the default of that clearing house. 
Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of 
total net revenue.
Parent Company:  JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: Represents unvested share-based 
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to 
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, 
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share 
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase 
grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based 
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to 
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period 
on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of 
common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition 
of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all 
earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to 
each class of common stock and participating securities, 
based on their respective rights to receive dividends. 
PCA: Prompt corrective action

PD: Probability of defaultPPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small 
Business Association (“SBA”)
PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority 
Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue 
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this 
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a 
lending institution to generate income in excess of its 
provision for credit losses.
Pre-tax margin: Represents income before income tax 
expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in 
management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax 
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs 
are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which 
management evaluates the performance of AWM against 
the performance of their respective competitors.
Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including:  
•the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the 
price at which a market participant is willing and able to 
sell an instrument to  t h e  F i r m  and the price at which 
another market participant is willing and able to buy it 
from  the Firm , and vice versa; and  
•realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, including 
those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily 
used in client-driven market-making activities, and on 
private equity investments.  
–Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, 
or interim cash payments.  
–Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation.  
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities,  the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities.  
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and 
unrealized gains and losses related to:  
•derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting 
relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity 
and foreign exchange risk;  
•derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, 
primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange 
risk.
Production revenue:  Includes fees and income recognized 
as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to 
sell, and the impact of risk management activities 
associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse 
loans. Production revenue also includes gains and losses on 
sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on 
mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain 
repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), 
and changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
measured under the fair value option.Glossary of Terms and Acronyms

differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive 
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally 
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced.

principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing 
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional 
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates 
or indexes.  
Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting results on a 
managed basis, the total net revenue for each of the 
business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-

The Listed Preferred Stock ranks, as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-
up, on a parity with any series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock 
and to any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock. The Listed Preferred Stock is subordinate to our 
existing and future indebtedness.
Dividend Rights
Holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly authorized 
committee of our board, cash dividends at the rates and on the dates described below under “Specific Terms of Listed Preferred 
Stock”. We will pay each dividend to the holders of record as they appear on our stock register on record dates determined by our 
board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board. Dividends on the Listed Preferred Stock are noncumulative. If a 
dividend is not declared on any series of Listed Preferred Stock, because the dividends are noncumulative, then the right of holders of 
that series to receive that dividend will be lost, and we will have no obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or 
not dividends are declared for any future dividend period.
We may not declare or pay or set aside for payment full dividends on any series of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends, equally 
with or junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock unless we have previously declared and paid or set aside for payment, or we 
contemporaneously declare and pay or set aside for payment, full dividends on that series of Listed Preferred Stock for the most 
recently completed dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full on a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other 
series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that series, all dividends declared and paid upon the shares of that 
series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the that series will be 
declared and paid pro rata. For purposes of calculating the pro rata allocation of partial dividend payments, we will allocate dividend 
payments based on the ratio between the then-current dividends due on shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and (i) in the case of 
any series of non-cumulative preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the 
current and unpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock and (ii) in the case of any series of cumulative preferred stock 
ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and accumulated and unpaid 
dividends due on such series of preferred stock.
In addition, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Listed Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or a sum 
sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment in respect of the applicable most recently completed dividend period, 
with respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock:
•  n o  d i v i d e n d  ( o t h e r  t h a n  a  d i v i d e n d  i n  c o m m o n  s t o c k  o r  i n  a n y  o t h e r  c a p i t a l  s t o c k  r a n k i n g  j u n i o r  t o  t h a t  L i s t e d  P r e f e r r e d  
Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) will be declared or paid or a sum sufficient for the 
payment thereof set aside for such payment or other distribution declared or made upon our common stock or upon any 
other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-
up, and
• no common stock or other capital stock ranking junior or equally with that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon 
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any 
moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such capital stock) by us, 
except:
(1) by conversion into or exchange for capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;
(2) as a result of reclassification into capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;
(3) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of shares of capital stock ranking junior to 
that Listed Preferred Stock or, in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock, 
through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of capital stock ranking on 
a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock; 
(4) in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock, pursuant to pro rata offers to 
purchase all or a pro rata portion of the shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and such capital stock ranking on a 
parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;
(5) in connection with the satisfaction of our obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary course 
prior to the beginning of the most recently completed dividend period; or
(6) any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock 
pursuant to any of our or our subsidiaries’ employee, consultant or director incentive or benefit plans or 
arrangements (including any employment, severance or consulting arrangements) adopted before or after the 
issuance of that Listed Preferred Stock).
However, the foregoing will not restrict our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to engage in underwriting, stabilization, 
market-making or similar transactions in our capital stock in the ordinary course of business. Subject to the conditions described 
above, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, capital stock, or otherwise), as may be determined by our board of directors or 
a duly authorized committee of our board, may be declared and paid on our common stock and any other capital stock ranking junior 
to or on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the 
holders of the Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.
As used herein, “junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to our common stock and any other class or series of 
our capital stock over which the Listed Preferred Stock has preference or priority, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, 
dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; “parity preferred stock” and “on a parity with a series of Listed 
Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks on a parity with the shares of a particular 
series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may 
require; and “senior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks 
senior to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as 
the context may require.
We will compute the amount of dividends payable by annualizing the applicable dividend rate and dividing by the number of dividend 
periods in a year, except that the amount of dividends payable for any period greater or less than a full dividend period, other than 
the initial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and, for any period 
less than a full month, the actual number of days elapsed in the period. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be 
rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Rights Upon Liquidation 
In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of each series of Listed Preferred Stock will 
be entitled to receive and to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders the amount of $10,000 per 
share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends, before we make any distribution of 
assets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock of such 
series. After the payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled, such holders will have no right or 
claim to any of our remaining assets.
If, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, we fail to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to 
a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, and any stock having the same rank as that series, the holders of that series and of that 
other stock will share ratably in any such distribution of our assets in proportion to the full respective distributions to which they are 
entitled. For any series of Listed Preferred Stock, neither the sale of all or substantially all of our property or business, nor our 
merger or consolidation into or with any other entity will be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, voluntary of or 
involuntary, of us.
Because we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and our stockholders, including the holders of the Listed 
P r e f e r r e d  S t o c k ,  t o  p a r t i c i p a t e  i n  t h e  a s s e t s  o f  a n y  o f  o u r  s u b s i d i a r i e s  u p o n  t h a t  s u b s i d i a r y ’ s  l i q u i d a t i o n ,  d i s s o l u t i o n ,   w i n d i n g - u p   o r  
recapitalization may be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that we are a creditor with 
recognized claims against the subsidiary.
Holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are subordinate to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets, 
including in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. In addition, holders of the Listed 
Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a receivership, 
insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.
Redemption 
We may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock on the dates and at the redemption prices set forth below under “Specific 
Terms of Listed Preferred Stock”. In addition, we may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock in whole, but not in part, at a 
redemption price equal to $10,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, 
following the occurrence of a capital treatment event. For these purposes, “capital treatment event” means the good faith 
determination by JPMorgan Chase that, as a result of any:
• amendment to, or change or any announced prospective change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any 
political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of 
such series of Listed Preferred Stock;
• proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares 
of such series of Listed Preferred Stock; or
• official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or 
applying those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of such 
series of Listed Preferred Stock,
there is more than an insubstantial risk that JPMorgan Chase will not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the full liquidation 
amount of all shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock then outstanding as “additional Tier 1 capital” (or its equivalent) for 
purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency, as then in effect and 
applicable, for as long as any share of such series of Listed Preferred Stock is outstanding. Redemption of any Listed Preferred Stock 
is subject to our receipt of any required approvals from the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory authority.
If we elect to redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, we will provide notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, 
addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed. Such mailing will be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days 
before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice so mailed will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the 
holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any 
holder of shares of the series designated for redemption will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other 
shares of that series. Each notice of redemption will state:
• the redemption date;
• the number of shares of the series of Listed Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such 
holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder;
• the redemption price;
• the place or places where the certificates representing such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption 
price; and
• that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the series of Listed Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust 
Company, or “DTC”, we may give such notice in any manner permitted or required by DTC. For each series of Listed Preferred Stock, 
neither the holders of a series nor the holders of the related depositary shares have the right to require redemption of such series of 
Listed Preferred Stock.
In the case of any redemption of only part of the shares a series of Listed Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of the 
series to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of that series in proportion to the number of shares 
held by such holders or by lot. From and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accumulate on the shares of Listed 
Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date and all rights of the holders of those shares, except the right to 
receive the redemption price, will cease.
In the event that we fail to pay full dividends, including accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, on any series of Listed Preferred 
Stock, we may not redeem that series in part and we may not purchase or acquire any shares of that series, except by a purchase or 
exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of that series.
Preemptive and Conversion Rights
The Listed Preferred Stock is not subject to any preemptive rights and is not convertible into property or shares of any other class or 
s e r i e s  o f  o u r  c a p i t a l  s t o c k .  
Depositary, Transfer Agent, and Registrar
Computershare Inc. is the depositary, transfer agent and registrar for each series of the Listed Preferred Stock and the related 
depositary shares.
Voting Rights
Except as indicated below or except as expressly required by applicable law, the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are not entitled 
to vote. Each share of Listed Preferred Stock a series is entitled to one vote on matters on which holders of that series are entitled to 
vote. The voting power of each series of Listed Preferred Stock depends on the number of shares in that series, and not on the 
aggregate liquidation preference or initial offering price of the shares of that series.
If, at any time or times, the equivalent of an aggregate of six quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, for any series of Listed 
Preferred Stock has not been paid, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be automatically increased by two 
and the holders of each outstanding series of Listed Preferred Stock with such voting rights, together with holders of such other 
shares of any other class or series of parity preferred stock outstanding at the time upon which like voting rights have been conferred 
and are exercisable, which we refer to as “voting parity stock,” voting together as a class, will be entitled to elect those additional two 
directors, which we refer to as “preferred directors,” at that annual meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders 
until full dividends have been paid for at least four quarterly consecutive dividend periods. At that time such right will terminate, 
except as expressly provided in the applicable certificate of designations or by law, subject to revesting. Upon any termination of the 
right of the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock and voting parity stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the 
preferred directors will cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all preferred directors then in office will terminate 
immediately and the authorized number of directors will be reduced by the number of preferred directors elected. Any preferred 
director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided by law or without cause by the affirmative vote of the 
holders of shares of the Listed Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with the holders of shares of voting parity stock, to the 
extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. Any vacancy created by removal with or without cause 
may be filled only as described in the preceding sentence. If the office of any preferred director becomes vacant for any reason other 
than removal, the remaining preferred director may choose a successor who will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of 
which such vacancy occurred.
So long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock remains outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote of 
the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series and any voting parity stock, voting together as a class, authorize, 
create or issue any capital stock ranking senior to that series as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or 
reclassify any authorized capital stock into any such shares of such capital stock or issue any obligation or security convertible into or 
evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of capital stock. So long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock 
remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series, 
amend, alter or repeal any provision of the applicable certificate of designations or our certificate of incorporation, including by 
merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of that series.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following will be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of 
any series of Listed Preferred Stock:
• any increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized preferred stock, or any increase or decrease in the 
number of shares of any series of preferred stock, or the authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of 
capital stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to that series of Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon 
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;
• a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase with or into another entity in which the shares of that series remain 
outstanding; and
• a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase with or into another entity in which the shares of the that series are converted 
into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity or any entity, directly or indirectly, controlling such 
surviving entity and such new preference securities have powers, preferences and special rights that are not materially less 
favorable than that series;
provided that if the amendment would adversely affect such series but not any other series of preferred stock outstanding, then the 
amendment will only need to be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the series of Listed Preferred Stock 
adversely affected.
In exercising the voting rights described above or when otherwise granted voting rights by operation of law or by us, each share of 
Listed Preferred Stock with respect to a series will be entitled to one vote (equivalent to 1/400th  o f  a  v o t e  p e r  r e l e v a n t  d e p o s i t a r y  
share).
If we redeem or call for redemption all outstanding shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock and irrevocably deposit in trust 
sufficient funds to effect such redemption, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be 
required or upon which the holders of such series will be entitled to vote will be effected, the voting provisions described above will 
not apply.
Our board of directors may also from time to time, without notice to or consent of holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, issue 
additional shares of such series. Delaware law provides that the holders of preferred stock will have the right to vote separately as a 
class on any amendment to our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations) that would increase or decrease 
the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, increase or decrease the par value of such class or adversely affect the 
powers, preferences and special rights of the shares of preferred stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as permitted by law, our 
certificate of incorporation provides that any increase or decrease in our authorized capital stock may be adopted by the affirmative 
vote of holders of capital stock representing not less than a majority of the voting power represented by the outstanding shares of 
our capital stock entitled to vote. If any proposed amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of one 
or more series of preferred stock so as to affect them adversely, but would not so affect the entire class of preferred stock, only the 
shares of the series so affected will be considered a separate class for purposes of this vote on the amendment. This right is in 
addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations).
Under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, if the holders of any series of our preferred stock become entitled to vote 
for the election of directors because dividends on that series are in arrears, that series may then be deemed a “class of voting 
securities.” In such a case, a holder of 25% or more of the series, or a holder of 5% or more if that holder would also be considered 
to exercise a “controlling influence” over JPMorgan Chase, may then be subject to regulation as a bank holding company in 
accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, (1) any other bank holding company may be required to obtain the prior 
approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire or retain 5% or more of that series, and (2) any person other than a bank holding 
company may be required to provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring or retaining 10% or more of that series.
Description of Depositary Shares
The following summary of the terms of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed Preferred Stock is not complete. 
You should refer to each of the deposit agreements among us, the depositary, and the holders from time to time of the depositary 
receipts evidencing the depositary shares relating to each series of the Listed Preferred Stock for the complete terms of those 
depositary shares. Each of those deposit agreements has been filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed in connection 
with the issuance of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed Preferred Stock.
General. Each depositary share represents a 1/400th  i n t e r e s t  i n  a  s h a r e  o f  t h e  r e l e v a n t  s e r i e s  o f  L i s t e d  P r e f e r r e d  S t o c k ,  a n d  i s  
evidenced by depositary receipts. In connection with the issuance of each series of Listed Preferred Stock, we deposited shares of 
that series of Listed Preferred Stock with Computershare Inc., as depositary under the deposit agreement relating to that series of 
Listed Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms of each deposit agreement, the depositary shares are entitled to all the powers, 
preferences and special rights of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, as applicable, in proportion to the applicable fraction 
of a share of Listed Preferred Stock those depositary shares represent.
Dividends and Other Distributions. Each dividend payable on a depositary share will be in an amount equal to 1/400th  o f  t h e  d i v i d e n d  
declared and payable on the related share of the Listed Preferred Stock.
The depositary will distribute all dividends and other cash distributions received on the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock to 
the holders of record of the related depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder. In the 
event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the holders of record of the 
depositary receipts as nearly as practicable in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder, unless the 
depositary determines that this distribution is not feasible, in which case the depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of 
distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of the property and distribution of the net proceeds of that sale to the 
h o l d e r s  o f  t h e  d e p o s i t a r y  r e c e i p t s .  
Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding 
r e c o r d  d a t e s  f o r  t h e  r e l a t e d  s h a r e s  o f  L i s t e d  P r e f e r r e d  S t o c k .  
The amount paid as dividends or otherwise distributable by the depositary with respect to the depositary shares or the underlying 
Listed Preferred Stock will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by us or the depositary on account of taxes or other 
g o v e r n m e n t a l  c h a r g e s .  
Redemption of Depositary Shares. If we redeem a series of Listed Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, the 
corresponding depositary shares also will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the redemption of the 
Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be 1/400th  o f  t h e  r e d e m p t i o n  p r i c e  p e r  
share payable with respect to the Listed Preferred Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of 
u n d e c l a r e d  d i v i d e n d s .  
If we redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same 
redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing those shares of the Listed Preferred Stock so redeemed. If we 
redeem less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary will select pro rata or by lot those depositary shares to be 
redeemed. The depositary will mail notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary receipts not less than 30 and not more 
t h a n  6 0   d a y s  p r i o r  t o  t h e  d a t e  f i x e d  f o r  r e d e m p t i o n  o f  t h e  L i s t e d  P r e f e r r e d  S t o c k  a n d  t h e  r e l a t e d  d e p o s i t a r y  s h a r e s .  
The redemption of depositary shares that are held in book-entry form through DTC will be effected in accordance with the applicable 
p r o c e d u r e s  o f  D T C .  
Voting the Listed Preferred Stock. Because each depositary share represents a 1/400th  i n t e r e s t  i n  a  s h a r e  o f  L i s t e d  P r e f e r r e d  S t o c k ,  
holders of depositary receipts will be entitled to 1/400th  o f  a  v o t e  p e r  d e p o s i t a r y  s h a r e  u n d e r  t h o s e  l i m i t e d  c i r c u m s t a n c e s  i n  w h i c h  
h o l d e r s  o f  t h e  L i s t e d  P r e f e r r e d  S t o c k  a r e  e n t i t l e d  t o  a  v o t e .  
When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the 
depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to that Listed 
Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for 
the applicable Listed Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by 
the holder’s depositary shares. To the extent practicable, the depositary will vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock 
represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all actions that the depositary 
determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from 
the holders of any depositary shares representing the Listed Preferred Stock, it will abstain from voting with respect to such shares.
Withdrawal of Listed Preferred Stock. Underlying shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn from the depositary arrangement 
upon surrender of depositary receipts at the depositary’s office and upon payment of the taxes, charges and fees provided for in the 
deposit agreement. Subject to the terms of the relevant deposit agreement, the holder of depositary receipts will receive the 
appropriate number of shares of Listed Preferred Stock represented by such depositary shares. Only whole shares of Listed Preferred 
Stock may be withdrawn; if a holder holds an amount other than a whole multiple of 400 depositary shares, the depositary will 
deliver along with the withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred Stock a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of 
depositary shares. Holders of withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to redeposit such shares or to receive 
depositary shares.
Form and Notices. Each series of Listed Preferred Stock was issued in registered form to the depositary, and the depositary shares 
representing that Listed Preferred Stock were issued in book-entry only form through DTC. The depositary will forward to the holders 
of depositary shares all reports, notices, and communications from us that are delivered to the depositary and that we are required to 
furnish to the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock.
Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement .   W e  a n d  t h e  d e p o s i t a r y  m a y  a m e n d  a n y  f o r m  o f  d e p o s i t a r y  r e c e i p t  e v i d e n c i n g  
depositary shares and any provision of any deposit agreement at any time regarding any depositary shares. However, any 
amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares representing a particular series of 
Listed Preferred Stock or would be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights granted to holders of that underlying Listed 
Preferred Stock pursuant to our certificate of incorporation will not be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the 
holders of at least a majority of the related depositary shares then outstanding. The deposit agreement relating to the depositary 
shares representing a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock may be terminated by us or by the depositary only if:
• all such outstanding depositary shares have been redeemed; or
• there has been a final distribution of the relevant underlying Listed Preferred Stock in connection with our liquidation, 
dissolution or winding up and the preferred stock has been distributed to the holders of depositary receipts.
Charges of Depositary.   W e  w i l l  p a y  a l l  t r a n s f e r  a n d  o t h e r  t a x e s  a n d  g o v e r n m e n t a l  c h a r g e s  a r i s i n g  s o l e l y  f r o m  t h e  e x i s t e n c e  o f  t h e  
depositary arrangements regarding any depositary shares. We also pay charges of the depositary in connection with the initial 
deposit of each series of Listed Preferred Stock and any redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock. Holders of depositary receipts will 
pay transfer and other taxes and governmental charges and other charges with respect to their depositary receipts as expressly 
provided in the deposit agreement.
Resignation and Removal of Depositary.   W i t h  r e s p e c t  t o  t h e  d e p o s i t a r y  s h a r e s  r e p r e s e n t i n g  e a c h  s e r i e s  o f  L i s t e d  P r e f e r r e d  S t o c k ,  t h e  
depositary may resign at any time by delivering a notice to us of its election to do so. We may remove the depositary at any time. Any 
such resignation or removal will take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of its appointment. 
We must appoint a successor depositary within 60 days after delivery of the notice of resignation or removal.
Miscellaneous.   T h e  d e p o s i t a r y  w i l l  f o r w a r d  t o  h o l d e r s  o f  a p p l i c a b l e  d e p o s i t a r y  r e c e i p t s  a l l  r e p o r t s  a n d  c o m m u n i c a t i o n s  f r o m  u s  t h a t  
we deliver to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the relevant Listed Preferred Stock.
Neither we nor the depositary will be liable if either of us is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond our control in 
performing our respective obligations under any deposit agreement. Our obligations and those of the depositary will be limited to 
performing in good faith our respective duties under any deposit agreement. Neither we nor the depositary will be obligated to 
prosecute or defend any legal proceeding relating to any depositary shares or Listed Preferred Stock unless satisfactory indemnity is 
furnished. We and the depositary may rely upon written advice of counsel or accountants, or upon information provided by persons 
presenting preferred stock for deposit, holders of depositary receipts or other persons we believe to be competent, and on

DESCRIPTION OF THE ALERIAN MLP INDEX ETNS DUE MAY 24, 2024
The following description of our Alerian MLP Index ETNs due May 24, 2024 (the “Alerian ETNs”) is a summary and does not purport 
to be complete.  It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated May 25, 2001 (as may be amended or 
supplemented from time to time, the “2001 Indenture”), between JPMorgan Chase, as issuer, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company 
Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to 
the Form 10-K.  We encourage you to read the 2001 Indenture for additional information.
General
In June 2012, the maximum number of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance was set at 129,000,000, resulting in a maximum 
aggregate principal amount of $2,455,722,690.  All of the Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance were issued as of June 2012.  
10,000,000 Alerian ETNs were retired on December 16, 2015.  Accordingly, since the retirement of these notes, the maximum 
number of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance is 119,000,000 with an aggregate principal amount of $2,265,356,590, all of which 
has been issued and remain outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
The Alerian ETNs are linked to the Alerian MLP Index (the “Index”) and are our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will 
rank pari passu  with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  The Alerian ETNs do not guarantee any return of 
principal at, or prior to, maturity or upon early repurchase.  Any payment on the Alerian ETNs is subject to the credit risk of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co.
The Alerian ETNs are part of a series of our debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series E” (the “Series E Notes”) that 
we may issue under the 2001 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the Series E Notes, please see the section 
titled “General Terms of the Series E Notes” below.  
The Alerian ETNs are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other 
governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.
Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Alerian ETNs are registered on the books 
that we or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests 
in the Alerian ETNs (registered in street name or otherwise).
Please see “Certain Defined Terms” below for an explanation of any capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined.
The Index
The return of the Alerian ETNs is linked to the performance of the Index.  The Index measures the composite performance of energy-
oriented Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, and is calculated and maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index 
Calculation Agent”), in consultation with GKD Index Partners, LLC (the “Index Sponsor”), using a float-adjusted, market capitalization 
methodology.  MLPs are limited partnerships primarily engaged in the exploration, marketing, mining, processing, production, 
refining, storage, or transportation of any mineral or natural resource.
Denominations
The Alerian ETNs are denominated in U.S. dollars in minimum denominations equal to the $19.03661 per note (the “Principal 
Amount”), which is the amount equal to the Initial VWAP Level (defined below), divided  by ten.
Coupon Payments and the Accrued Tracking Fee
For each Alerian ETN a holder holds on the applicable Coupon Record Date, holders will receive on each Coupon Payment Date the 
“Coupon Amount,” which is an amount in cash equal to the difference between (a) the Reference Distribution Amount (defined 
below), calculated as of the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date and (b) the Accrued Tracking Fee (defined below), calculated as of 
the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date.
The Accrued Tracking Fee accrues on a daily basis at a rate of 0.85% per annum, applied to the Daily Note Value as of the Index 
Business Day immediately preceding the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date.  The Daily Note Value reflects the cumulative 
performance of the VWAP Level of the Index since April 1, 2009, which we refer to as the Inception Date. If the Daily Note Value 
increases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will increase, and if the Daily Note Value decreases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will decrease. The 
Daily Note Value is published on the Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”) under the ticker symbol “AMJIVWAP” and on 
Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol “AMJIVWAP:IND.”
On any Index Business Day, the VWAP Level reflects the weighted VWAPs of the Index Components, and the VWAP of each Index 
Component is the volume-weighted average price of one share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation 
Agent based on the Primary Exchange for that Index Component.  
To the extent the Reference Distribution Amount on any Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the 
corresponding Coupon Valuation Date, there will be no coupon payment made on the corresponding Coupon Payment Date, and an 
amount equal to the difference between the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Reference Distribution Amount (the “Tracking Fee 
Shortfall”) will be included in the Accrued Tracking Fee for the next Coupon Valuation Date.  This will be in addition to the accrual at a 
rate of 0.85% per annum over the quarter that has elapsed since the previous date of determination.  This process will be repeated 
to the extent necessary until the Reference Distribution Amount for a Coupon Valuation Date is greater than the Accrued Tracking Fee 
for the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date (which includes the accumulated Tracking Fee Shortfall from all prior quarters).  This 
process may also restart as necessary on a subsequent Coupon Valuation Date.  Coupon payments on the Alerian ETNs will be payable 
quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth Index Business Day following each Coupon Valuation Date, provided  that the final Coupon 
Payment Date will be the Maturity Date.  The final Coupon Amount will be included in the Cash Settlement Amount.
Holders will receive no coupon payment on a Coupon Payment Date if the Reference Distribution Amount on the relevant Coupon 
Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the relevant Coupon Valuation Date.
On each Index Business Day, the Note Calculation Agent will calculate the value of the Coupon Amount as of the immediately 
preceding Index Business Day (treating that immediately preceding Index Business Day as if it were a Coupon Valuation Date), which 
we refer to as the interim accrued Coupon Amount, and will publish the interim accrued Coupon Amount on Bloomberg under the 
ticker symbol “AMJEU” and on Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol “AMJEU:IND.” While the interim accrued Coupon Amount is 
calculated and published in connection with each such Index Business Day, the actual Coupon Amount will be calculated and paid only 
once each quarter.
Payment Upon Early Repurchase
Subject to a holder's compliance with the procedures and the potential postponements and adjustments as described under “Market 
Disruption Events” below, that holder may submit a request once a week (generally on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on 
Thursday) during the term of the Alerian ETNs to have us repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, provided  that holder requests that 
we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs.  If a holder requests that we repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, subject to the 
notification requirements and the other terms and conditions set forth under “Repurchase Requirements” below, for each Alerian 
ETN that holder will receive a cash payment on the relevant Repurchase Date equal to the Repurchase Amount.  If the Repurchase 
Amount is $0 or less, the payment upon early repurchase will be $0.  Because the Repurchase Amount is based on the value of the 
Index at the end of a five-day measurement period that begins after a repurchase request is received, holders will not know the 
Repurchase Amount they will receive at the time they elect to request that we repurchase their Alerian ETNs.
The Repurchase Amount is calculated by adjusting the Principal Amount to reflect:
• the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;
• the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee;
• the deduction of the Repurchase Fee;
• the addition of other adjustments representing accrued but unpaid coupons, which include the following:
• the Coupon Amount with respect to the Coupon Valuation Date immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase 
Valuation Date (generally the last Index Business Day of the week in which a repurchase is requested) if, on the last 
Index Business Day in the Repurchase Measurement Period the Coupon Ex-Date with respect to that Coupon 
Amount has not yet occurred. The Repurchase Measurement Period is a five-Index Business Day period commencing 
on the Repurchase Valuation Date during which the Final VWAP Level will be determined;
• an Adjusted Coupon Amount, if any, that reflects certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-
dividend dates from and excluding the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date to and including the 
applicable Repurchase Valuation Date, less the Accrued Tracking Fee; and
• certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase Measurement 
Period.
For purposes of determining the Cash Settlement Amount, the Final VWAP Level will be the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels 
measured on each Index Business Day in the Repurchase Measurement Period, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.  
The Repurchase Fee Amount is equal to 0.125% of the Principal Amount, adjusted to reflect:
• the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;
• the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee; and
• the addition of certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase 
Measurement Period.
Accordingly, the Repurchase Fee Amount will vary based on the performance of the Index, the Accrued Tracking Fee and certain cash 
distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase Measurement Period.
Holders may lose some or all of their investment upon early repurchase.  Because the Accrued Tracking Fee reduces their final 
payment, holders will likely lose some or all of their principal amount upon early repurchase if the Final VWAP Level is less than the 
Initial VWAP Level or if the Final VWAP Level is not greater than the Initial VWAP Level by an amount that is sufficient to offset the 
negative effect of the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Repurchase Fee.
Repurchase Requirements
To exercise the right to have us repurchase a holder's Alerian ETNs on a weekly basis, that holder must instruct that holder's broker 
or other person through whom that holder holds the Alerian ETNs to take the following steps:
• Send a notice of repurchase, substantially in the specified form (a “Repurchase Notice”), to us via email at 
ETN_Repurchase@jpmorgan.com by no later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, during the term of the Alerian ETNs, each 
week on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Valuation Date (generally Thursday);
• If we receive that holder's Repurchase Notice by the time specified in the preceding bullet point, we will respond by sending 
that holder a confirmation of repurchase, substantially in the specified form (a “Repurchase Confirmation”);
• Deliver the signed Repurchase Confirmation, in the specified form, to us via facsimile to (917) 456-3471, by 4:00 p.m., New 
York City time, on the Business Day on which that holder submitted that holder's Repurchase Notice.  We or our affiliate must 
acknowledge receipt in order for that holder's Repurchase Confirmation to be effective;
• Instruct DTC custodian for that holder to book a delivery versus payment trade with respect to that holder's Alerian ETNs on 
the relevant Repurchase Valuation Date at a price equal to the applicable Repurchase Amount; and
• Cause that holder's DTC custodian to deliver the trade as booked for settlement via DTC at or prior to 10:00 a.m. New York 
City time on the relevant Repurchase Date.
Different brokerage firms may have different deadlines for accepting instructions from their customers.  Accordingly, holders should 
consult the brokerage firm through which they own their interest in the offered Alerian ETNs in respect of such deadlines.  If we do 
not receive a holder's Repurchase Notice by 11:00 a.m., or a holder's Repurchase Confirmation by 4:00 p.m., on the Business Day 
immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Valuation Date, that holder's Repurchase Notice will not be effective and we will 
not repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs on the relevant Repurchase Date.
The Note Calculation Agent will, in its sole discretion, resolve any questions that may arise as to the validity of a Repurchase Notice 
and the timing of receipt of a Repurchase Notice or as to whether and when the required deliveries have been made.  Once given, a 
Repurchase Notice may not be revoked.  
Expiration of Repurchase Rights
If we do not receive a holder's Repurchase Notice by 11:00 a.m., New York City time (as described under the first bullet point in 
“Repurchase Requirements” above), or a holder's Repurchase Confirmation by 4:00 p.m., New York City time (as described under the 
third bullet point in “Repurchase Requirements” above) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase 
Valuation Date (generally Thursday), that holder's Repurchase Notice will not be effective and we will not repurchase that holder's 
Alerian ETNs on the relevant Repurchase Date.  Any Repurchase Notice for which we (or our affiliate) receive a valid Repurchase 
Confirmation in accordance with the procedures described above will be irrevocable.
Payment at Maturity
For each Alerian ETN, unless earlier repurchased, holders will receive at maturity a cash payment equal to the Cash Settlement 
Amount.  If the Cash Settlement Amount is $0 or less, the payment at maturity will be $0.
The Cash Settlement Amount is calculated by adjusting the Principal Amount to reflect:
• the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;
• the addition of the final Coupon Amount, if any,
• the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee; and
• the addition of certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Final Measurement 
Period.
The Final Measurement Period is a five Index Business Day period near the Maturity Date of the Alerian ETNs during which the Final 
VWAP Level will be determined.  
For purposes of determining the Cash Settlement Amount, the Final VWAP Level will be the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels 
measured on each Index Business Day in the Final Measurement Period, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.  The Initial 
VWAP Level is the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels measured on each Index Business Day over a three Index Business Day period 
ending on the Inception Date, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.  
Holders may lose some or all of their investment at maturity.  Because the Accrued Tracking Fee reduces their final payment, holders 
will likely lose some or all of their principal amount at maturity if the Final VWAP Level is less than the Initial VWAP Level or if the 
Final VWAP Level is not greater than the Initial VWAP Level by an amount that is sufficient to offset the negative effects of the 
Accrued Tracking Fee.  
Note Calculation Agent
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, or JPMS (the “Note Calculation Agent”), will make all necessary calculations and determinations in 
connection with the Alerian ETNs, including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Alerian ETNs,  other 
those to be made by the VWAP Calculation Agent described below.
VWAP Calculation Agent 
The JPMorgan Global Index Research Group (the “VWAP Calculation Agent”), one of our affiliates, will on each day that is not a 
Disrupted Day (as defined below) act as the VWAP Calculation Agent.  The VWAP Calculation Agent will determine the VWAP of any 
Index Component, the VWAP Level and the Final VWAP Level on any Index Business Day on which such VWAP, VWAP Level and Final 
VWAP Level are to be determined during the term of the Alerian ETNs.  
Market Disruption Events
To the extent a Disrupted Day (as defined below) exists with respect to an Index Component on an Averaging Date (as defined below), 
the VWAP and published share weighting with respect to such Index Component (and only with respect to such Index Component) for 
such Averaging Date will be determined by the Note Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates on the first succeeding Index Business 
Day that is not a Disrupted Day (the “Deferred Averaging Date”) with respect to such Index Component irrespective of whether 
pursuant to such determination, the Deferred Averaging Date would fall on a date originally scheduled to be an Averaging Date.  For 
the avoidance of doubt, if the postponement described in the preceding sentence results in the VWAP of a particular Index 
Component being calculated on a day originally scheduled to be an Averaging Date, for purposes of determining the VWAP Levels on 
the Index Business Days during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, the Note 
Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates, as the case may be, will apply the VWAP and the published share weighting with respect to 
such Index Component for such Deferred Averaging Date to the calculation of the VWAP Level (i) on the date(s) of the original 
disruption with respect to such Index Component and (ii) such Averaging Date.  
In no event, however, will any postponement pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph result in the final Averaging Date with 
respect to any Index Component occurring more than three Index Business Days following the day originally scheduled to be the final 
Averaging Date.  If the third Index Business Day following the date originally scheduled to be the final Averaging Date is not an Index 
Business Day or is a Disrupted Day with respect to such Index Component, the Note Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates, will 
determine the VWAP and share weighting with respect to any Index Component required to be determined for the purpose of 
calculating the applicable VWAP Level based on its good faith estimate of the VWAP and share weighting of each such Index 
Component that would have prevailed on the Primary Exchange on such third Index Business Day but for such suspension or 
limitation.
An “Averaging Date” means each of the Index Business Days during the Final Measurement Period or the Repurchase Measurement 
Period, as applicable, subject to adjustment as described herein. 
A “Disrupted Day” with respect to any Index Component is any Index Business Day on which the Primary Exchange or any Related 
Exchange fails to open for trading during its regular trading session or on which a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is 
continuing, and, in both cases, the occurrence of which is determined by the Note Calculation Agent to have a material effect on the 
VWAP Level.
With respect to an Index Component, a “Market Disruption Event,” means:
(a) the occurrence or existence of a condition specified below:
(i) any suspension, absence or limitation of trading on the Primary Exchange for trading in the Index Component, whether by 
reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the Primary Exchange or otherwise; 
(ii) any suspension, absence or limitation of trading on the Related Exchange for trading in futures or options contracts related to 
the Index Component, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by such Related Exchange or 
otherwise; or 
(iii) any event (other than an event described in (b) below) that disrupts or impairs (as determined by the Note Calculation 
Agent) the ability of market participants in general (A) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for the relevant Index 
Component or (B) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, futures or options contracts relating to the relevant 
Index Component; or
(b) the closure on any Index Business Day of the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange prior to its Scheduled Closing Time 
unless such earlier closing time is announced by the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange at least one hour prior to the earlier 
of (i) the actual closing time for the regular trading session on the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index 
Business Day and (ii) the submission deadline for orders to be entered into the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange system 
for execution at the close of trading on such Index Business Day;
in each case determined by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion; and
(c) a determination by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion that the applicable event described above materially 
interfered with our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to adjust or unwind all or a material portion of any hedge with respect 
to the Alerian ETNs.
For purposes of the above definition:
(a) a limitation on the hours or number of days of trading will not constitute a Market Disruption Event if it results from an announced 
change in the regular business hours of the Primary Exchange or Related Exchange, and
(b) for purposes of clause (a) above, limitations pursuant to the rules of any Primary Exchange or Related Exchange similar to NYSE 
Rule 80B or Nasdaq Rule 4120 (or any applicable rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by any other self-regulatory 
organization or any government agency of scope similar to NYSE Rule 80B or Nasdaq Rule 4120 as determined by the Note 
Calculation Agent) on trading during significant market fluctuations will constitute a suspension, absence or material limitation of 
trading.
“Scheduled Closing Time” means, with respect to the Primary Exchange or the Related Exchange, on any Index Business Day, the 
scheduled weekday closing time of the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index Business Day, without regard to 
after hours or any other trading outside of the regular trading session hours.
Discontinuation of the Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation
If the Index Calculation Agent discontinues publication of or otherwise fails to publish the Index, or the Index Calculation Agent does 
not make the Index Components, their share weighting and/or the Index Divisor available to the VWAP Calculation Agent, and the 
Index Sponsor, the Index Calculation Agent or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Note Calculation Agent 
determines to be comparable to the discontinued Index and for which the Index Components, their share weighting, and/or the Index 
Divisor are available to the VWAP Calculation Agent (such index being referred to herein as a “successor index”), then the VWAP 
Level for such successor index will be determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent by reference to the sum of the products of the 
VWAPs of the components underlying such successor index on the Primary Exchanges and each such component's respective 
weighting within the successor index (which sum will be adjusted by any index divisor used by such successor index) on the dates and 
at the times as of which the VWAP Levels for such successor index are to be determined. 
Upon any selection by the Note Calculation Agent of a successor Index, the Note Calculation Agent will cause written notice thereof to 
be furnished to the Trustee, to us and to the holders of the Alerian ETNs.
If the Index Calculation Agent discontinues publication of the Index or does not make the Index Components, their share weightings 
and/or Index Divisor available to the VWAP Calculation Agent prior to, and such discontinuation or unavailability is continuing on the 
Calculation Date or any Index Business Day during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as 
applicable, or any other relevant date on which the VWAP Level is to be determined and the Note Calculation Agent determines that 
no successor index is available at such time, or the Note Calculation Agent has previously selected a successor index and publication 
of such successor index is discontinued prior to, and such discontinuation is continuing on the Calculation Date or any Index Business 
Day during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, or any other relevant date on 
which the VWAP Level is to be determined, then the Note Calculation Agent will determine the relevant VWAP Levels using the VWAP 
and published share weighting of each Index Component included in the Index or successor index, as applicable, immediately prior to 
such discontinuation or unavailability, as adjusted for certain corporate actions.  In such event, the Note Calculation Agent will cause 
notice thereof to be furnished to the Trustee, to us and to the holders of the Alerian ETNs.
Notwithstanding these alternative arrangements, discontinuation of the publication of the Index or successor index, as applicable, 
may adversely affect the value of the Alerian ETNs.
If at any time the method of calculating the Index or a successor index, or the value thereof, is changed in a material respect, or if the 
Index or a successor index is in any other way modified so that the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index does not, in the 
opinion of the Note Calculation Agent, fairly represent the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index had such changes or 
modifications not been made, then the Note Calculation Agent will make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith 
judgment of the Note Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a VWAP level of an index comparable to the Index or 
such successor index, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and the Note Calculation Agent will 
calculate the VWAP Levels for the Index or such successor index with reference to the Index or such successor index, as adjusted.  The 
Note Calculation Agent will accordingly calculate any values that reference the VWAP Levels based on the relevant VWAP Levels 
calculated by the Note Calculation Agent, as adjusted.  Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index or a successor index is 
modified so that the level of the Index or such successor index is a fraction of what it would have been if there had been no such 
modification ( e.g., due to a split in the index), which, in turn, causes the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index to be a 
fraction of what it would have been if there had been no such modification, then the Note Calculation Agent will make such 
calculations and adjustments in order to arrive at a VWAP Level for the Index or such successor index as if it had not been modified 
(e.g., as if such split had not occurred).
Payment upon an Event of Default
In case an event of default with respect to the Alerian ETNs shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and 
payable per Alerian ETN upon any acceleration of the Alerian ETNs will be determined by the Note Calculation Agent and will be an 
amount in cash equal to the Repurchase Amount, calculated as if the date of acceleration were the first Index Business Day in the 
Repurchase Measurement Period and the four Index Business Days immediately succeeding the date of acceleration were the 
corresponding Index Business Days in the accelerated Repurchase Measurement Period.  For purposes of this calculation the 
Repurchase Fee Amount shall be zero.
If the maturity of the Alerian ETNs is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, we will, or will cause the Note 
Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee may conclusively rely, 
and to DTC, as holder of the Alerian ETNs, of the cash amount due with respect to the Alerian ETNs as promptly as possible and in no 
event later than two Business Days after the date of acceleration.
Listing
The Alerian ETNs have been listed on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol “AMJ.”  No assurance can be given as to the continued 
listing of the Alerian ETNs for their term or of the liquidity or trading market for the Alerian ETNs.
Book-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company
DTC will act as securities depositary for the Alerian ETNs.  The Alerian ETNs have been issued only as fully registered securities 
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's nominee).  One or more fully registered global note certificates, representing the total 
aggregate principal amount of the Alerian ETNs, have been issued and have been deposited with DTC.  We will not issue definitive 
notes in exchange for the global notes except in limited circumstances.
Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent
The Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Alerian ETNs.  The Bank of New 
York Mellon will also act as paying agent and may designate additional paying agents.
Reissuances or Reopening Issuances
We may in our sole discretion, “reopen” or reissue the Alerian ETNs based upon market conditions and VWAP Levels at that time.  
These further issuances, if any, will be consolidated to form a single sub-series with the originally issued Alerian ETNs and will have 
the same CUSIP number and will trade interchangeably with the Alerian ETNs immediately upon settlement.  Any Alerian ETNs 
bearing the same CUSIP number that are issued pursuant to any future additional issuances of Alerian ETNs bearing the same CUSIP 
number will increase the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Alerian ETNs.  The price of any additional offering will be 
determined at the time of pricing of that offering.

General Terms of the Series E Notes
In this “General Terms of the Series E Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series E Notes issued by 
JPMorgan Chase. 
The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities, 
including the Alerian ETNs.  
We have summarized below the material provisions of the 2001 Indenture and the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture.  
These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2001 Indenture, which describes completely the terms 
and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued under it.  Where 
appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2001 Indenture.  Any reference to particular sections or 
defined terms of the 2001 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by 
reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.
The debt securities will be our direct, unsecured general obligations and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of our other 
unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries.  As a result, claims of the holders of 
the debt securities will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries, except to the extent that JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those subsidiaries.  Claims of our subsidiaries' creditors other 
than JPMorgan Chase & Co. include substantial amounts of long-term debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities 
loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.
Events of Default and Waivers
An “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture is defined in the 2001 Indenture as:
• default for 30 days in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series;
• default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity, 
upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;
• failure by us for 90 days to perform any other covenants or warranties contained in the 2001 Indenture applicable to that 
series after written notice has been given by the trustee to us or given by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal 
amount of the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to us and the trustee;
• specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary; or
• any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2001 Indenture or form of security. 
(Section 5.01)
If a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable on the debt securities, or a failure in the performance of 
any covenant or agreement, or any other Event of Default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2001 Indenture 
or form of security, with respect to one or more (but in the case of a default in performance of a covenant or agreement, or in a 
manner provided in a supplemental indenture or form of security, less than all) series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, 
either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then 
outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any 
interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately.  If a default in the performance of any covenant or agreement with 
respect to  all series of debt securities, or in a manner provided in a supplemental indenture or form of security with respect to all 
series of debt securities, or due to specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, 
either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all debt securities then outstanding, treated 
as one class, by written notice, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued thereon, to be 
due and payable immediately.  Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by 
the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 
5.10)
An Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to 
any other series of debt securities.  The 2001 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt 
securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt 
securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Trustees and/or 
responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the 
applicable series to do so.  The Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other 
amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11)
The 2001 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each 
series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for 
any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The Trustee may decline to act if the 
direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2001 Indenture. (Section 5.09)  The Trustee is not 
obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2001 Indenture at the request or direction of the holders of debt securities 
unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein 
or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))
No holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously 
given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25% 
in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request upon the Trustee to institute such 
action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal 
amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) have not given direction to the Trustee that is 
inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06)
However, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security 
or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected 
without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07)
The 2001 Indenture requires us to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to whether or not we have knowledge of a 
default. (Section 3.05)
Covenant Breach
Under the 2001 Indenture, a “Covenant Breach” would occur with respect to a series of debt securities if we fail to perform or breach 
any of the covenants contained in the 2001 Indenture (other than a failure to pay principal or interest on the debt securities) and 
that failure or breach continues for 90 days after the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 
outstanding debt securities give written notice of that failure or breach.  Neither the Trustee nor the holders of the debt securities will 
be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the debt securities as a result of any Covenant Breach. 
If a Covenant Breach or Event of Default with respect to the debt securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion 
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the holders of the debt securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings 
as the Trustee deems most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or 
agreement in the 2001 Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the 2001 Indenture, or to enforce any other 
proper remedy.
Modification of the 2001 Indenture
The 2001 Indenture contains provisions permitting us and the Trustee to modify the 2001 Indenture or the rights of the holders of 
debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each outstanding series of 
debt securities affected by the modification.  Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a modification that would:
• extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt security;
• reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;
• change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2001 Indenture applicable 
to debt securities in foreign currencies;
• change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any debt 
security;
• reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;
• adversely affect the terms on which debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable or payable in other securities, 
instruments, contracts, currencies, commodities or other forms of property;
• impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any right of 
repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security; or
• reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any modification. 
(Section 8.02)
The 2001 Indenture also permits us and the Trustee to amend the 2001 Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of 
the holders of debt securities to evidence our merger or the replacement of the Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or 
supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, to make any change to the 2001 Indenture or our debt securities that we deem 
necessary or desirable and that does not materially and adversely affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain 
other purposes. (Section 8.01)
Consolidations, Mergers and Sales of Assets
We may not merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to any other 
entity (other than the sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to one or more of our direct or indirect 
subsidiaries), unless:
• either we are the continuing corporation or the successor entity or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or 
transferred is a United States corporation or limited liability company that expressly assumes the due and punctual payment 
of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture and 
the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2001 Indenture binding upon 
us, and
• we or the successor entity will not, immediately after the merger or consolidation, sale, conveyance or transfer, be in default 
in the performance of any covenant or condition of the 2001 Indenture binding on us. (Section 9.01)
There are no covenants or other provisions in the 2001 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in 
the event of a recapitalization transaction, a change of control of JPMorgan Chase & Co. or a highly leveraged transaction.  The 
merger covenant described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged 
transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase & Co. or a sale or conveyance of all or 
substantially all of our assets.  However, we may provide specific protections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular 
debt securities, which we would describe in the applicable prospectus supplement.
Concerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent
Our subsidiaries and we have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New 
York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Bank of New York Mellon and, for notes settled through Euroclear 
Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents, 
registrars, authenticating agents and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture.
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the trustee for other securities issued by us or JPMorgan Financial, 
including the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture, the debt securities issued under JPMorgan Financial's indenture for 
debt securities, to which we are a guarantor, and the warrants issued under JPMorgan Financial's warrant indenture, to which we are 
a guarantor.  Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to any of these securities, the Trustee may 
be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  In that case, the Trustee 
may be required to resign under the 2001 Indenture, and we would be required to appoint a successor trustee.  For this purpose, a 
“potential” event of default means an event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving us default notice or for 
the default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded.
Governing Law and Judgments
The debt securities and the 2001 Indenture will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.  
(Section 11.08) 
DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASE FINANCIAL COMPANY LLC’S CALLABLE FIXED RATE NOTES DUE JUNE 10, 2032, FULLY AND 
UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.
The following description of the Callable Fixed Rate Notes due June 10, 2032 (the “Callable Notes”) is a summary and does not 
purport to be complete.  It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated February 19, 2016 (as may 
be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “2016 Indenture”), among JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, as issuer 
(“JPMorgan Financial” or the “Issuer”), JPMorgan Chase, as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company 
Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to the Form 10-K .  We encourage you to read 
the 2016 Indenture for additional information.
General
As of December 31, 2021, $5,000,000 aggregate  principal amount of the Callable Notes were outstanding.
The Callable Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Financial, the payment of which is fully and 
unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.   The Callable Notes will rank pari passu  with all of the Issuer’s other unsecured 
and unsubordinated obligations.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s guarantee of the Callable Notes will rank pari passu  with all of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  Any payment on the Callable Notes issued by JPMorgan Financial is 
subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Finance Callable Notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the 
Callable Notes.
The Callable Notes are part of a series of the Issuer’s debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the “Series A 
Notes”) that the Issuer may issue under the 2016 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the Series A Notes, 
please see the section titled “— General Terms of the Series A Notes” below.
The Callable Notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other 
governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.
Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Callable Notes are registered on the books 
that the Issuer or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial 
interests in the Callable Notes (registered in street name or otherwise).
Key Terms of the Callable Notes
We issued the Callable Notes on June 10, 2021, in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 thereafter.  
The Maturity Date of the Callable Notes is June 10, 2032.  Interest on the Callable Notes is payable semiannually on June 10th and 
December 10th of each year, beginning on December 10, 2021 to and including the Maturity Date (each, an “Interest Payment 
Date”), subject to any earlier redemption, at the Interest Rate of 2.60% per annum. 
On June 10, 2031 (the “Redemption Date”), the Issuer may redeem the holders’ Callable Notes, in whole but not in part, at a price 
equal to the principal amount being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest.  Any accrued and unpaid interest on the Callable 
Notes redeemed will be paid to the person who is the holder of record on such Callable Notes at the close of business one (1) 
business day prior to the Redemption Date.  To redeem the Callable Notes, the Issuer will deliver notice to DTC, as holder of the 
Callable Notes, at least 5 business days and not more than 15 business days prior to the Redemption Date.
Calculation Agent 
JPMS (the “Calculation Agent”) will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Callable Notes, 
including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Callable Notes.
Payment upon an Event of Default
In case an event of default with respect to the Callable Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and 
payable per $1,000 principal amount note upon any acceleration of the Callable Notes will be determined by the Calculation Agent 
and will be an amount in cash equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount note plus accrued and unpaid interest, calculated as if 
the date of acceleration were the Maturity Date.  In such case, interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the 
actual number of days in such adjusted Interest Period and will be based on the Interest Rate on the applicable date immediately 
preceding such adjusted Interest Period.
If the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, the Issuer will, or will cause the 
Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee may conclusively rely, 
and to DTC of the cash amount due with respect to the Callable Notes as promptly as possible and in no event later than two business 
days after the date of acceleration.
Listing
The Callable Notes are listed and admitted to trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol “JPM/32.” No assurance can be given as 
to the continued listing for the term of the Callable Notes, or the liquidity or trading market for the Callable Notes. 
Book-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company
DTC will act as securities depositary for the Callable Notes.  The Callable Notes have been issued only as fully registered securities 
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s nominee).  One or more fully registered global note certificates, representing the total 
aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes, have been issued and have been deposited with DTC.  We will not issue definitive 
notes in exchange for the global notes except in limited circumstances.
Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent
The Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Callable Notes.  The Bank of New 
York Mellon will also act as paying agent for the Callable Notes and may designate additional paying agents.
Reopening Issuances
The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, “reopen” the Callable Notes based upon market conditions at that time.  These further 
issuances, if any, will be consolidated with, have the same CUSIP number as and trade interchangeably with the respective originally 
issued Callable Notes immediately upon settlement and, consequently, will increase the aggregate principal amount of such 
outstanding Callable Notes.  The price of any additional offering will be determined at the time of pricing of that offering.
General Terms of the Series A Notes
In this “General Terms of the Series A Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series A Notes issued by 
JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC.
The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities, 
including the Callable Notes.
We have summarized below the material provisions of the 2016 Indenture and the debt securities and guarantees issued under the 
2016 Indenture.
These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2016 Indenture, which describes completely the terms 
and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued under it.  Where 
appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2016 Indenture.  Any reference to particular sections or 
defined terms of the 2016 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by 
reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.
The debt securities will be the Issuer’s direct, unsecured general obligations, the payment on which is fully and unconditionally 
guaranteed by the Guarantor, and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of the Issuer’s other unsecured and unsubordinated 
debt.
The Guarantor is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries.  As a result, claims of the 
holders of the debt securities against the Guarantor under the guarantee will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of 
the Guarantor’s subsidiaries, except to the extent that the Guarantor may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those 
subsidiaries.  Claims of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries’ creditors other than the Guarantor include substantial amounts of long-term 
debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and 
other borrowed funds.
Events of Default and Waivers
An “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture is defined in the 2016 Indenture as:
• default in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 30 days;
• default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity, 
upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;
• default in the performance, or breach, of any other covenants or warranties applicable to the Issuer contained in the 2016 
Indenture applicable to that series, and continuation of such default or breach for 90 days after written notice has been 
given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Guarantor or given by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of 
the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee;
• certain events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or 
involuntary;
• the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the 2016 Indenture, or the Guarantor 
denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee, provided  that no Event of Default with respect to the guarantee will 
occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, the insolvency of the Guarantor or the commencement of 
proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code, or the appointment of a receiver for the Guarantor under Title II of the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having 
separately repudiated the Guarantee in receivership, or the commencement of or certain other events of the Guarantor’s 
bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation; or
• any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security. 
(Section 5.01)
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable on 
the debt securities, a failure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement applicable to the Issuer, the guarantee 
ceasing to be in full force and effect, or any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 
Indenture or form of security, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt 
securities of such series then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor, may declare the 
principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately.  If a 
default due to specified events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is 
continuing, the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued thereon will automatically, and without any 
declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable.  Subject to certain 
conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal 
amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10)
Events of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an 
Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.  In addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or 
warranties (other than a payment default) will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.  
Therefore, events of bankruptcy, resolution, receivership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor (in the 
absence of any such event occurring with respect to the Issuer) will not permit any of the debt securities to be declared due and 
payable and the Trustee is not authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or 
continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.  Instead, even if an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, 
receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has occurred, the Trustee and the holders of debt securities of a 
series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities to be immediately due and payable unless there is an Event of Default 
with respect to that series as described above, such as the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation or 
a payment default by the Issuer or the Guarantor on the relevant debt securities.  The value holders receive on any series of debt 
securities may be significantly less than what holders would have otherwise received had the Issuer’s debt securities been 
declared due and payable immediately or the Trustee been authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the 
Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.
An Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to 
any other series of debt securities.  The 2016 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt 
securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt 
securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Trustees and/or 
responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the 
applicable series to do so.  The Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other 
amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11)
The 2016 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each 
series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for 
any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The Trustee may decline to act if the 
direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2016 Indenture. (Section 5.09)  The Trustee is not 
obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2016 Indenture at the request or direction of the holders of debt securities 
unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein 
or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))
No holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously 
given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25% 
in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request upon the Trustee to institute such 
action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal 
amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) have not given direction to the Trustee that is 
inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06)
However, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security 
or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected 
without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07)
The 2016 Indenture requires the Issuer and the Guarantor to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to whether or not 
the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, has knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05)
Modification of the 2016 Indenture
The 2016 Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to modify the 2016 Indenture or the 
rights of the holders of debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
each outstanding series of debt securities affected by the modification.  Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a 
modification that would:
• extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt security;
• reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;
• change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2016 Indenture applicable 
to debt securities in foreign currencies;
• change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any debt 
security;
• reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;
• impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any right of 
repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security;
• reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any modification; 
or
• make any change in the guarantee that would adversely affect the holders of the debt securities of such series or release the 
Guarantor from the guarantee other than pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Indenture. (Section 8.02)
The 2016 Indenture also permits the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to amend the 2016 Indenture in certain circumstances 
without the consent of the holders of debt securities to evidence the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s merger or the replacement of the 
Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, to make any change to the 2016 
Indenture or the Issuer’s debt securities that the Issuer deems necessary or desirable and that does not materially and adversely 
affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain other purposes. (Section 8.01)
Consolidations, Mergers, Sales and Transfers of Assets
Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor may merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or substantially all 
of their respective assets to any other entity, unless:
• with respect to the Issuer:
• either the Issuer is the continuing company in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor entity in the case 
of a merger or consolidation (including an affiliate of the Guarantor) or the entity to whom those assets are sold, 
conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation or limited liability 
company that expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other 
amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and 
conditions of the 2016 Indenture binding upon the Issuer, and
• no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has 
occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer, 
and
• with respect to the Guarantor:
• either the Guarantor is the continuing corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor corporation 
in the case of a merger or consolidation or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case 
of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation that expressly assumes the full and unconditional 
guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt 
securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016 
Indenture binding upon the Guarantor, and
• no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has 
occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer. 
(Sections 9.01 and 9.02)
Any transfer of material assets of the Guarantor to any other entity that occurs as a result of, or because it is related directly or 
indirectly to, any proceedings relative to the Guarantor under Title 11 of the United States Code or under a receivership under Title II 
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or under any other applicable federal or state 
bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or other similar law will be deemed to be a sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of 
the Guarantor’s assets.
There are no covenants or other provisions in the 2016 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in 
the event of a recapitalization transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor, a change of control of the Issuer or the Guarantor or 
a highly leveraged transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor.  The merger covenant described above would apply only if the 
recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of 
the Issuer or the Guarantor or a sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s assets.  However, the 
Issuer may provide specific protections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which the Issuer would 
describe in the applicable prospectus supplement.
JPMorgan Chase Guarantee
The Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee the full and punctual payment of the principal of, interest on, and all other 
amounts payable under the debt securities when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity, upon redemption, 
repurchase at the option of the holders of the applicable debt securities or upon acceleration.  If for any reason the Issuer does not 
make any required payment in respect of the Issuer’s debt securities when due, the Guarantor will on demand pay the unpaid amount 
at the same place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by the Issuer under the 2016 Indenture.  The guarantee is 
of payment and not of collection. (Section 14.01)
The Guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee are unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be liable for 
any amount of payment that the Issuer is excused from making or any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by the 
Issuer, and (2) any defense or counterclaims available to the Issuer (except those resulting solely from, or on account of, the Issuer’s 
insolvency or the Issuer’s status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) will also be available to the Guarantor 
to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available to the Issuer, whether or not asserted by the Issuer. (Section 
14.02)
Concerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent
We, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company 
Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.  The Bank of New York Mellon and, for 
notes settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London 
Branch, will be the paying agents, authenticating agents, registrars and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2016 
Indenture.
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the Trustee for the debt securities issued under our 2016 Indenture, to 
which JPMorgan Chase acts as a guarantor, the warrants issued under our warrant indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase acts as a 
guarantor, and the debt securities issued under JPMorgan Chase’s indenture.  Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default 
occurs with respect to any of these securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust 
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  In that case, the Trustee may be required to resign under the 2016 Indenture, and the Issuer 
would be required to appoint a successor trustee.  For this purpose, a “potential” event of default means an event that would be an 
event of default if the requirements for giving the Issuer default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of time 
were disregarded.
Governing Law and Judgments
The debt securities and the 2016 Indenture, including the guarantee, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws 
of the State of New York. (Section 11.08)

Non-Solicitation	of	Employees	and	Customers
During	your	employment	by	the	Firm	and	for	the	longer	of	the	(i)	one	year	period	following	the	termination	of	your	employment	or,	(ii)	if	your	
award	is	not	cancelled	as	of	your	termination	date,	the	three	year	period	from	Grant	Date,	you	will	not	directly	or	indirectly,	whether	on	your

encourage	any	of	the	Firm’s	then	current	employees	to	leave	the	Firm	or	to	apply	for	employment	elsewhere,	unless	such	current	employee	
has	received	official,	written	notice	that	his	or	her	employment	will	be	terminated	due	to	job	elimination,	(ii)	hire	any	employee	or	former	
employee	who	was	employed	by	the	Firm	at	the	date	your	employment	terminated,	unless	the	individual’s	employment	terminated	because	
his	or	her	job	was	eliminated,	or	the	individual’s	employment	with	the	Firm	has	been	terminated	for	more	than	six	months,	(iii)	to	the	fullest	
extent	enforceable	under	applicable	law,	solicit	or	induce	or	attempt	to	induce	to	leave	the	Firm,	or	divert	or	attempt	to	divert	from	doing

known	to	you	by	virtue	of	your	employment	with	the	Firm,	or	otherwise	interfere	with	the	relationship	between	the	Firm	and	such	customers,	
suppliers	or	other	persons	or	entities. 		This	does	not	apply	to	publicly	known	institutional	customers	that	you	service	after	your	employment	
with	the	Firm	without	the	use	of	the	Firm’s	confidential	or	proprietary	information.	
These	restrictions	do	not	apply	to	authorized	actions	you	take	in	the	normal	course	of	your	employment	with	the	Firm,	such	as	employment	
decisions	with	respect	to	employees	you	supervise	or	business	referrals	in	accordance	with	the	Firm’s	policies.
Confidential	Information
You	will	not,	either	during	your	employment	with	the	Firm	or	thereafter,	directly	or	indirectly	(i)	use	or	disclose	to	anyone	any	confidential	
information	related	to	the	Firm’s	business,	or	(ii)	communicate	with	the	press	or	other	media	about	matters	related	to	the	Firm,	its	customers	
or	employees,	including	matters	and	activities	relating	to	your	employment,	or	the	employment	of	others,	by	the	Firm,	in	the	case	of	either	(i)	
or	(ii),	except	as	explicitly	permitted	by	the	JPMorgan	Chase	Code	of	Conduct	and	applicable	policies	or	law	or	legal	process. 		In	addition,	
following	your	termination	of	employment,	you	will	not,	without	prior	written	authorization,	access	the	Firm’s	private	and	internal	information	
through	telephonic,	intranet	or	internet	means. 		“Confidential	information”	shall	have	the	same	meaning	for	the	Award	Agreement	as	it	has	in	
the	JPMorgan	Chase	Code	of	Conduct. 		
Nothing	in	this	award	precludes	you	from	reporting	to	the	Firm’s	management	or	directors,	the	government,	a	regulator,	a	self-regulatory	
agency,	your	attorneys	or	a	court,	conduct	you	believe	to	be	in	violation	of	the	law	or	concerns	of	any	known	or	suspected	Code	of	Conduct	
violation.		It	is	also	not	intended	to	prevent	you	from	responding	truthfully	to	questions	or	requests	from	the	government,	a	regulator	or	in	a	
court	of	law.
Non-Disparagement
You	will	not,	either	during	your	employment	with	the	Firm	or	thereafter,	make	or	encourage	others	to	make	any	public	statement	or	release	
any	information	in	verbal,	written,	electronic	or	any	other	form,	that	is	intended	to,	or	reasonably	could	be	foreseen	to,	disparage,	embarrass	
or	criticize	the	Firm	or	its	employees,	officers,	directors	or	shareholders	as	a	group. 		This	shall	not	preclude	you	from	reporting	to	the	Firm’s	
management	or	directors	or	to	the	government	or	a	regulator	conduct	you	believe	to	be	in	violation	of	the	law	or	the	Firm’s	Code	of	Conduct	
or	responding	truthfully	to	questions	or	requests	for	information	to	the	government,	a	regulator	or	in	a	court	of	law	in	connection	with	a	legal	
or	regulatory	investigation	or	proceeding.
Cooperation	
You	will	cooperate	fully	with	and	provide	full	and	accurate	information	to	the	Firm	and	its	counsel	with	respect	to	any	matter	(including	any	
audit,	tax	proceeding,	litigation,	investigation	or	governmental	proceeding)	with	respect	to	which	you	may	have	knowledge	or	information,	
subject	to	reimbursement	for	actual,	appropriate	and	reasonable	out-of-pocket	expenses	incurred	by	you.
Compliance	with	Award	Agreement	
You	will	provide	the	Firm	with	any	information	reasonably	requested	to	determine	compliance	with	the	Award	Agreement,	and	you	authorize	
the	Firm	to	disclose	the	terms	of	the	Award	Agreement	to	any	third	party	who	might	be	affected	thereby,	including	your	prospective	
employer.
Notice	Period	
If	you	are	subject	to	a	notice	period	or	become	subject	to	a	notice	period	after	the	Grant	Date,	whether	by	contract	or	by	policy,	that	requires	
you	to	provide	advance	written	notice	of	your	intention	to	terminate	your	employment	(“Notice	Period”),	then	as	consideration	for	this	award	
and	continued	employment,	you	will	provide	the	Firm	with	the	necessary	advance	written	notice	that	applies	to	you,	as	specified	by	such	
contract	or	policy. 		
After	receipt	of	your	notice,	the	Firm	may	choose	to	have	you	continue	to	provide	services	during	the	applicable	Notice	Period	or	may	place	
you	on	a	paid	leave	for	all	or	part	of	the	applicable	Notice	Period. 		During	the	Notice	Period,	you	shall	continue	to	devote	your	full	time	and	
loyalty	to	the	Firm	by	providing	services	in	a	cooperative	and	professional	manner	and	not	perform	any	services	for	any	other	employer	and	
shall	receive	your	base	salary	and	certain	benefits	until	your	employment	terminates. 		You	and	the	Firm	may	mutually	agree	to	waive	or	
modify	the	length	of	the	Notice	Period.	
Regardless	of	whether	a	Notice	Period	applies	to	you,	you	must	comply	with	the	180-day	advance	notice	period	described	under	the	
subsection	captioned	“--Full	Career	Eligibility”	in	the	event	you	wish	to	terminate	employment	under	that	same	subsection.
Remedies 
Cancellation	
In	addition	to	the	cancellation	provisions	described	under	the	sections	captioned	“ Protection-Based	Vesting ”,	“Bonus	Recoupment ”,	“Recapture	
Provisions ”	and	“Termination	of	Employment ”,	your	outstanding	RSUs	under	this	award	may	be	cancelled	if	the	Firm	in	its	sole	discretion	
determines	that:
•you	have	failed	to	comply	with	any	of	the	advance	notice/cooperation	requirements	or	employment	restrictions	applicable	to	your	
termination	of	employment,	or
•you	have	failed	to	return	the	required	forms	specified	under	the	section	captioned	“ Release/Certification ”	by	the	specified	deadline,	or
•you	have	violated	any	of	the	provisions	as	set	forth	above	in	the	section	captioned	“ Your	Obligations ”.
To	the	extent	provided	under	the	subsection	captioned	“--Amendment”	below,	JPMorgan	Chase	reserves	the	right	to	suspend	vesting	of	this	award	
and/or	distribution	of	shares	under	this	award,	including,	without	limitation,	during	any	period	that	JPMorgan	Chase	is	evaluating	whether	this	
award	is	subject	to	cancellation	and/or	recovery	and/or	whether	the	conditions	for	distributions	of	shares	under	this	award	are	satisfied.		JPMorgan	
Chase	is	not	responsible	for	any	price	fluctuations	during	any	period	of	suspension	and,	if	applicable,	suspended	units	will	be	reinstated	consistent	
with	Plan	administration	procedures.	See	also	subsection	captioned	“--No	Ownership	Rights/Other	Limitations”.
Recovery
In	addition,	you	may	be	required	to	pay	the	Firm	up	to	an	amount	equal	to	the	Fair	Market	Value	(determined	as	of	the	applicable	vesting	date)	of	
the	gross	number	of	shares	of	Common	Stock	previously	distributed	under	this	award	as	follows:
•Payment	may	be	required	with	respect	to	any	shares	of	Common	Stock	distributed	within	the	three	year	period	prior	to	a	notice-of-
recovery	under	this	section,	if	the	Firm	in	its	sole	discretion	determines	that:
◦you	committed	a	fraudulent	act,	or	engaged	in	knowing	and	willful	misconduct	related	to	your	employment,	or
◦you	violated	any	of	the	provisions	as	set	forth	above	in	the	section	captioned	“ Your	Obligations ”,	or
◦you	 violated	 the	 employment	 restrictions	 set	 forth	 in	 the	 subsection	 “--Full	 Career	 Eligibility”	 or	 “--Government	 Office”	
following	the	termination	of	your	employment.
•In	addition,	payment	may	be	required	with	respect	to	any	shares	distributed	within	the	one	year	period	prior	to	notice-of-recovery	under	
this	section,	if	the	Firm	in	its	sole	discretion	determines	appropriate	pursuant	to	the	provisions	in	the	section	captioned	“ Recapture	
Provisions ”.
Notice-of-recovery	under	this	subsection	is	a	written	(including	electronic)	notice	from	the	Firm	to	you	either	requiring	payment	under	this	
subsection	or	stating	that	JPMorgan	Chase	is	evaluating	requiring	payment	under	this	subsection.		Without	limiting	the	foregoing,	notice-of-
recovery	will	be	deemed	provided	if	the	Firm	makes	a	good	faith	attempt	to	provide	written	(including	electronic)	notice	at	your	last	known	address	
maintained	in	the	Firm’s	employment	records.		For	the	avoidance	of	doubt,	a	notice-of-recovery	that	the	Firm	is	evaluating	requiring	payment	
under	this	subsection	shall	preserve	JPMorgan	Chase’s	rights	to	require	payment	as	set	forth	above	in	all	respects	and	the	Firm	shall	be	under	no	
obligation	to	complete	its	evaluation	other	than	as	the	Firm	may	determine	in	its	sole	discretion.
For	purposes	of	this	subsection,	shares	distributed	under	this	award	include	shares	withheld	for	tax	purposes.		However,	it	is	the	Firm’s	intention	
that	you	only	be	required	to	pay	the	amounts	under	this	subsection	with	respect	to	shares	that	are	or	may	be	retained	by	you	following	a	
determination	of	tax	liability	and	that	you	will	not	be	required	to	pay	amounts	with	respect	to	shares	representing	irrevocable	tax	withholdings	or	
tax	payments	previously	made	(whether	by	you	or	the	Firm)	that	you	will	not	be	able	to	recover,	recapture	or	reclaim	(including	as	a	tax	credit,	
refund	or	other	benefit).		Accordingly,	JPMorgan	Chase	will	not	require	you	to	pay	any	amount	that	the	Firm	or	its	nominee	in	his	or	her	sole	
discretion	determines	is	represented	by	such	withholdings	or	tax	payments.
Payment	may	be	made	in	shares	of	Common	Stock	or	in	cash.		You	agree	that	any	repayment	will	be	a	lawful	recovery	under	the	terms	and	
conditions	of	your	Award	Agreement	and	is	not	to	be	construed	in	any	manner	as	a	penalty.		
Nothing	in	the	section	in	any	way	limits	your	obligations	under	“ Bonus	Recoupment ”.
Right	to	an	Injunction	
You	acknowledge	that	a	violation	or	attempted	violation	of	the	obligations	set	forth	herein	will	cause	immediate	and	irreparable	damage	to	the	
Firm,	and	therefore	agree	that	the	Firm	shall	be	entitled	as	a	matter	of	right	to	an	injunction,	from	any	court	of	competent	jurisdiction,	restraining	
any	violation	or	further	violation	of	such	obligations;	such	right	to	an	injunction,	however,	shall	be	cumulative	and	in	addition	to	whatever	other	
remedies	the	Firm	may	have	under	law	or	equity.
Administrative Provisions 
Withholding	Taxes :	As	a	result	of	legal	and/or	tax	obligations	the	Firm,	in	its	sole	discretion,	may	(i)	retain	from	each	distribution	the	number	of	
shares	of	Common	Stock	required	to	satisfy	applicable	tax	obligations	or	(ii)	implement	any	other	desirable	or	necessary	procedures,	so	that	
appropriate	withholding	and	other	taxes	are	paid	to	the	competent	authorities	with	respect	to	the	vested	shares,	dividend	equivalents	and	the	
award.		This	may	include	but	is	not	limited	to	(i)	a	market	sale	of	a	number	of	such	shares	on	your	behalf	substantially	equal	to	the	withholding	or	
other	taxes,	(ii)	to	the	extent	required	by	law,	withhold	from	cash	compensation,	an	amount	equal	to	any	withholding	obligation	with	respect	to	the	
award,	shares	that	vest	under	this	award,	and/or	dividend	equivalents,	and	(iii)	retaining	shares	that	vest	under	this	award	or	dividend	equivalents	
until	you	pay	any	taxes	associated	with	the	award,	vested	shares	and/or	the	dividend	equivalents	directly	to	the	competent	authorities.		
Right	to	Set	Off: 	Although	the	Firm	expects	to	settle	this	award	in	share(s)	of	Common	Stock	as	of	the	applicable	vesting	date,	as	set	forth	in	your	
Award	Agreement,	the	Firm	may,	to	the	maximum	extent	permitted	by	applicable	law	(including	Section	409A	of	the	Code	to	the	extent	it	is	
applicable	to	you),	retain	for	itself	funds	or	the	Common	Stock	resulting	from	any	vesting	of	this	award	to	satisfy	any	obligation	or	debt	that	you	
owe	to	the	Firm.		Notwithstanding	any	account	agreement	with	the	Firm	to	the	contrary,	the	Firm	will	not	recoup	or	recover	any	amount	owed	
from	any	funds	or	unrestricted	securities	held	in	your	name	and	maintained	at	the	Firm	pursuant	to	such	account	agreement	to	satisfy	any	
obligation	or	debt	owed	by	you	under	this	award	without	your	consent.		This	restriction	on	the	Firm	does	not	apply	to	accounts	described	and	
authorized	in	“No	Ownership	Rights/Other	Limitations”	described	below.
No	Ownership	Rights/Other	Limitations :		RSUs	do	not	convey	the	rights	of	ownership	of	Common	Stock	and	do	not	carry	voting	rights.		No	shares	
of	Common	Stock	will	be	issued	to	you	until	after	the	RSUs	have	vested.		Shares	will	be	issued	in	accordance	with	JPMorgan	Chase’s	procedures	for	
issuing	stock.		By	accepting	this	award,	you	authorize	the	Firm,	in	its	sole	discretion,	to	establish	on	your	behalf	a	brokerage	account	in	your	name	
with	the	Firm	or	book-entry	account	with	our	stock	plan	administrator	and/or	transfer	agent	and	deliver	to	that	account	any	vested	shares	derived	
from	the	award.		You	also	acknowledge	that	should	there	be	a	determination	that	the	cancellation	provisions	of	this	award	apply	during	the	period	
when	the	vesting	of	any	outstanding	RSUs	has	been	suspended,	then	you	agree	that	such	RSUs	may	be	cancelled	in	whole	or	part.	(See	Sections	
captioned	“ Protection-Based	Vesting ”,	“Bonus	Recoupment ”,	“Recapture	Provisions ”,	“Termination	of	Employment ”	and	“Remedies ”,	as	well	as	the	
subsection	captioned	“--Amendment”	permitting	suspension	of	vesting.)
With	respect	to	any	applicable	vesting	date,	JPMorgan	Chase	may	impose	for	any	reason,	as	of	such	vesting	date	for	such	period	as	it	may	specify	in	
its	sole	discretion,	such	restrictions	on	the	Common	Stock	to	be	issued	to	you	as	it	may	deem	appropriate,	including,	but	not	limited	to,	restricting	
the	sale,	transfer,	pledging,	assignment,	hedging	or	encumbrance	of	such	shares	of	Common	Stock.	Such	restrictions	described	in	the	last	sentence	
shall	not	impact	your	right	to	vote	or	receive	dividends	with	respect	to	the	Common	Stock.		By	accepting	this	award,	you	acknowledge	that	during	
such	specified	period	should	there	be	a	determination	that	the	recovery	provisions	of	this	award	apply,	then	you	agree	that	you	may	be	required	to	
pay	the	Firm	up	to	an	amount	equal	to	the	Fair	Market	Value	(determined	as	of	the	applicable	vesting	date)	of	the	gross	number	of	shares	subject	
to	such	restrictions	(notwithstanding	the	limitation	set	forth	in	the	“Right	to	Set	Off”	subsection	above).		(See	Sections	captioned	“ Bonus	
Recoupment ”	and	“Remedies ”.)
Binding	Agreement :	The	Award	Agreement	will	be	binding	upon	any	successor	in	interest	to	JPMorgan	Chase,	by	merger	or	otherwise.
Not	a	Contract	of	Employment :	Nothing	contained	in	the	Award	Agreement	constitutes	a	contract	of	employment	or	continued	employment.		
Employment	is	“at-will”	and	may	be	terminated	by	either	you	or	JPMorgan	Chase	for	any	reason	at	any	time.		This	award	does	not	confer	any	right	
or	entitlement	to,	nor	does	the	award	impose	any	obligation	on	the	Firm	to	provide,	the	same	or	any	similar	award	in	the	future	and	its	value	is	not	
compensation	for	purposes	of	determining	severance.
Section	409A	Compliance :		To	the	extent	that	Section	409A	of	the	Code	is	applicable	to	this	award,	distributions	of	shares	and	cash	hereunder	are	
intended	to	comply	with	Section	409A	of	the	Code,	and	the	Award	Agreement,	including	these	terms	and	conditions,	shall	be	interpreted	in	a	
manner	consistent	with	such	intent.
Notwithstanding	anything	herein	to	the	contrary,	if	you	(i)	are	subject	to	taxation	under	the	Code,	(ii)	are	a	specified	employee	as	defined	in	the	
JPMorgan	Chase	2005	Deferred	Compensation	Plan	and	(iii)	have	incurred	a		separation	from	service	(as	defined	in	that	Plan	with	the	exception	of	
death)	and	if	any	units/shares	under	this	award	represent	deferred	compensation	as	defined	in	Section	409A	and	such	shares	are	distributable	
(under	the	terms	of	this	award)	within	six	months	following,	and	as	a	result	of	your	separation	from	service,	then	those	shares	will	be	delivered	to	
you	during	the	first	calendar	month	after	the	expiration	of	six	full	months	from	date	of	your	separation	from	service.		Further,	if	your	award	is	not	
subject	to	a	substantial	risk	of	forfeiture	as	defined	by	regulations	issued	under	Section	409A	of	the	Code,	then	the	remainder	of	each	calendar	year	
immediately	following	(i)	each	applicable	vesting	date	set	forth	in	your	Award	Agreement	shall	be	a	payment	date	for	purposes	of	distributing	the	
vested	portion	of	the	award	and	(ii)	each	date	that	JPMorgan	Chase	specifies	for	payment	of	dividends	declared	on	its	Common	Stock,	shall	be	the	
payment	date(s)	for	purposes	of	distributing	dividend	equivalent	payments.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF JANUARY 18, 2022
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
OPERATING COMMITTEE
Award Agreement
These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of January 18, 2022 (“Grant Date”) awarding Restricted Stock Units 
(“RSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement (all 
references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and 
Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.
This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement.  Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner specified in the 
Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.   If you decline the award, it 
will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in “ Definitions ” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the 
Plan. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase” and together with its subsidiaries as the “Firm”.
Form and Purpose of Award
Each RSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date as set forth in your Award 
Agreement.
The purpose of this award is to motivate your future performance for services to be provided during the vesting period and to align your interests 
with those of the Firm and its shareholders.
Dividend Equivalents
This award is not eligible for dividend equivalent payments.
Protection-Based Vesting
This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date(s), provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting 
date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--
Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of RSUs in which you vest are subject to these terms and conditions 
(including, but not limited to, sections captioned “ Recapture Provisions ”, “Remedies ” and the following protection-based vesting provision).  
Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you during the vesting period (“At Risk RSUs”) may be cancelled 
if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk RSUs 
is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:
• Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share 
responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the 
CEO may consider in assessing performance are net income, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of 
the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. 
• For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is 
negative.
• Awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect 
responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.  
• The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.
In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling 
you to continued vesting in your award (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation 
circumstances described above will continue to apply to your At Risk RSUs pursuant to the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics 
or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity”.
Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Compensation and Management 
Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In the case of an award to the CEO, all such determinations 
shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.
Vesting Period
The period from the Grant Date to the last vesting date is the “vesting period” (see subsections captioned “--Amendment” pursuant to which the 
Firm may extend the vesting period and “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered 
shares of Common Stock following a vesting date).
Holding Requirement
As of each vesting date, you shall be entitled to a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of RSUs vesting on such date, less the 
number being withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  You agree that the distribution made to you will be held in an account in your name 
with restrictions preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such distribution for a twelve 
month period commencing with the vesting date.  Such restrictions shall lapse in event of your death.
Bonus Recoupment
In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy) as 
in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded to you for performance year 2021 and to this award.  You

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these terms and conditions in any way limits the rights of the Firm under the JPMorgan Chase Bonus 
Recoupment Policy (or successor policy).
EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff
In consideration of grant of this award, and without prejudice to any other provision of this Award Agreement, you agree that you are subject to the 
JPMorgan Chase EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff (and any applicable supplement(s) to that policy) or successor policy as in effect 
from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded to you for performance year 2021 and to this award. 
The provisions of the JPMorgan Chase EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff set out the terms and conditions applying to the grant of 
this award which ensure that the Firm is able to meet its regulatory obligations to operate malus (reduce) and/or clawback (recover) to awards in 
certain circumstances.  These include, but are not limited to, where (i) there is a material downturn in the Firm’s financial performance or (ii) where 
the Firm is required to hold more capital. The circumstances in which the events at (i) and (ii) would occur are analogous to some of the 
circumstances considered under the existing Firmwide terms and conditions, in particular the Bonus Recoupment Policy and the Protection Based 
Vesting provisions.  You can access this policy as currently in effect in My Rewards through the following link:  https://

Recapture Provisions (Detrimental Conduct, Risk-Related and Other Recapture Provisions)
Notwithstanding any terms of this Award Agreement to the contrary, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel up to 100% 
of your outstanding RSUs under this award and, to the extent set forth in “ Remedies ” below, to recover from you up to an amount equal to the Fair 
Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed (including shares 
withheld for tax purposes) under this award if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
• you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm or its business 
activities, or
• this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible for the inaccuracy, or
• this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or
• you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or 
concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business activities, or
• your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “ Definitions ” below) or, in the case of a determination after the 
termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated for Cause. 
See section captioned “ Remedies ” for additional information.  
Termination of Employment
Except as explicitly set forth below under the subsections captioned “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--
Disability” or under the section captioned “ Death ”, any RSUs outstanding under this award will be cancelled effective on the date your employment 
with the Firm terminates for any reason.
Subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ”, “Bonus Recoupment ”, “EMEA 
Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff ”, “Recapture Provisions ”, “Your Obligations ” and “ Remedies ”), you will be eligible to continue to vest (as 
you otherwise would vest if you were still employed by JPMorgan Chase) with respect to your award in accordance with its terms and conditions 
following the termination of your employment if one of the following circumstances applies to you:
•Job Elimination 
In the event that the Director of Human Resources or nominee in his or her sole discretion determines that
• the Firm terminated your employment because your job was eliminated, and 
• after you are notified that your job will be eliminated, you provided such services as requested by the Firm in a cooperative and 
professional manner, and
• you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below .

Service with the Firm and external professional experience (as attested by you to the Firm) equaled or exceeded 30 years, and
• you provided at least 180 days advance written notice to the Firm of your intention to voluntarily terminate your employment under 
this provision, during which notice period you provided such services as requested by the Firm in a cooperative and professional 
manner and you did not perform any services for any other employer, and 
• continued vesting shall be appropriate, which determination shall be made prior to your termination and will be based on your 
performance and conduct (before and after providing notice), and  
• for 36 months from the date of grant of this award you do not either perform services in any capacity (such as an employee, 
contractor, consultant, advisor, or self-employed individual, whether paid or unpaid) for a Financial Services Company (as defined 
below) or work in your profession (whether or not for a Financial Services Company); provided that you may work for a government, 
education or Not-for-Profit Organization (as defined below), and
• you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.
After receipt of such advance written notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during such 180-day period as a 
condition to continued vesting or shorten the length of the 180-day period at the Firm’s sole discretion, but to a date no earlier than the date 
you would otherwise meet the service requirement.  
Additional advance notice requirements may apply for employees subject to notice period policies (see “Notice Period” below).
•Government Office
In the event that you voluntarily terminate your employment with the Firm to accept a Government Office or become a candidate for an elective 
Government Office, as described at the end of these terms and conditions under the section captioned “ Government Office Requirements ”.  See 
also definition of Government Office in the section captioned “ Definitions ”.
•Disability 
In the event that 
• your employment with the Firm terminates because (i) you are unable to return to work while you are receiving benefits under the 
JPMorgan Chase Long Term Disability Plan, or for non-U.S. employees, under the equivalent JPMorgan Chase sponsored local country 
plan (in either case, “LTD Plan”), or (ii) if you are not covered by a LTD Plan, you are unable to return to work due to a long-term 
disability that would qualify for benefits under the applicable LTD Plan, as determined by the Firm or a third-party designated by the 
Firm; provided that you (x) request in writing continued vesting due to such disability within 30 days of the date your employment 
terminates, and (y) provide any requested supporting documentation and (z) receive the Firm’s written consent to such 
t r e a t m e n t ,  and
• you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.

To qualify for continued vesting after termination of your employment under any of the foregoing circumstances:
• you must timely execute and deliver a release of claims in favor of the Firm, having such form and terms as the Firm shall specify,
• with respect to “Full Career Eligibility”, prior to the termination of your employment, you must confirm with management that you meet 
the eligibility criteria (including providing at least 180 days advance written notification), advise that you are seeking to be treated as an 
individual eligible for “Full Career Eligibility”, and receive written consent to such continued vesting,
• with respect to “Full Career Eligibility” and “Government Office”, it is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to certify to the Firm

with the employment restrictions applicable to you (as described herein) from your date of termination of employment through the 
applicable vesting date, 
• with respect to “Disability”, you must satisfy the notice and documentation described above and receive written consent to such continued 
vesting, and
• in all cases, complied with all other terms of the Award Agreement.  (See section captioned “ Your Obligations ”.)
Death
If you die while you are eligible to vest in RSUs under this award, the RSUs will immediately vest and will be distributed in shares of Common Stock 
(after applicable tax withholding) to your designated beneficiary on file with the Firm’s Stock Administration Department, or if no beneficiary has 
been designated or survives you or if beneficiary designation is not recognized by local legislation, then to your estate.  Any shares will be 
distributed no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year which contains your date of death; however, our 
administrative practice is to register such shares in the name of your beneficiary or estate within 60 days of the Firm’s receipt of any required 
documentation.
Your Obligations 
In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree to comply with and be bound by the obligations set forth below next to the subsections 
captioned “--Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers”, “--Confidential Information”, “--Non-Disparagement”, ”--Cooperation”, “--Compliance 
with Award Agreement” and “--Notice Period.”
•Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers
During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment or, (ii) if your 
award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your 
own behalf or on behalf of any other party, without the prior written consent of the Director of Human Resources: (i) solicit, induce or 
encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has 
received official, written notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination, (ii) hire any employee or former employee 
who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment terminated because his or her job 
was eliminated, or the individual’s employment with the Firm has been terminated for more than six months, (iii) to the fullest extent 
enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business 
with the Firm, any then current customers, suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to 
you by virtue of your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, suppliers or 
other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service after your employment with the Firm 
without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information. 
These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, such as employment 
decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the Firm’s policies.
•Confidential Information
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly (i) use or disclose to anyone any confidential 
information related to the Firm’s business, or (ii) communicate with the press or other media about matters related to the Firm, its customers 
or employees, including matters and activities relating to your employment, or the employment of others, by the Firm, in the case of either (i) 
or (ii), except as explicitly permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process.  In addition, 
following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private and internal information 
through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  “Confidential information” shall have the same meaning for the Award Agreement as it has in 
the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct.  
Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a regulator, a self-regulatory 
agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct 
violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a 
court of law.
•Non-Disparagement
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make or encourage others to make any public statement or release 
any information in verbal, written, electronic or any other form, that is intended to, or reasonably could be foreseen to, disparage, embarrass 
or criticize the Firm or its employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group.  This shall not preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s 
management or directors or to the government or a regulator conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or the Firm’s Code of Conduct or 
responding truthfully to questions or requests for information to the government, a regulator or in a court of law in connection with a legal or 
regulatory investigation or proceeding.
•Cooperation 
You will cooperate fully with and provide full and accurate information to the Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter (including any 
audit, tax proceeding, litigation, investigation or governmental proceeding) with respect to which you may have knowledge or information, 
subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you.
•Compliance with Award Agreement 
You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award Agreement, and you authorize 
the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be affected thereby, including your prospective employer.
•Notice Period 
If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or by policy, that requires 
you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice Period”), then as consideration for this award 
and continued employment, you will provide the Firm with the necessary advance written notice that applies to you, as specified by such 
contract or policy.  
After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable Notice Period or may place you 
on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty 
to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall 
receive your base salary and certain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the 
length of the Notice Period. 
Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period described under the subsection 
captioned “--Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment under that same subsection.
Remedies 
•Cancellation 
In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ”, “Bonus Recoupment ”, “EMEA 
Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff ”, “Recapture Provisions ” and “ Termination of Employment ”, your outstanding RSUs under this 
award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
• you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions applicable to your 
termination of employment, or
• you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “ Release/Certification ” by the specified deadline, 
or
• you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “ Your Obligations ”.
To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this 
award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating 
whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are 
satisfied.  JPMorgan Chase is not responsible for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will 
be reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also subsection captioned “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.
•Recovery
In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) 
of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed under this award as follows:
• Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-
recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦ you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment, or
◦ you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “ Your Obligations ”, or
◦ you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “--Full Career Eligibility” or “--Government Office” 
following the termination of your employment.
• In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of-recovery 
under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate pursuant to the provisions in the section captioned 
“Recapture Provisions ”.
Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring payment under this 
subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-
recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known 
address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring 
payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall 
be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.
For purposes of this subsection, shares distributed under this award include shares withheld for tax purposes.  However, it is the Firm’s 
intention that you only be required to pay the amounts under this subsection with respect to shares that are or may be retained by you 
following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax 
withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including 
as a tax credit, refund or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in his 
or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.
Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and 
conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  
Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “ Bonus Recoupment ” and “ EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff ”.
•Right to an Injunction 
You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the 
Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, 
restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to 
whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.
Administrative Provisions 
Withholding Taxes :  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of 
shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that 
appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include 
but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the 
extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that 
vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and/or vested shares 
directly to the competent authorities.  
Right to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your 
Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is 
applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe 
to the Firm.  Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any 
funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt 
owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized in “No 
Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.
No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations :  RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of 
Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for 
issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name 
with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived 
from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period 
when the vesting of any outstanding RSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such RSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections 
captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ”, “Bonus Recoupment ”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff ”, “Recapture Provisions ”, 
“Termination of Employment ” and “ Remedies ”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)
With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in 
its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting 
the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence 
shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during 
such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to 
pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to 
such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above).  (See Sections captioned “ Bonus Recoupment ” 
and “ Remedies ”.)
Binding Agreement : The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.
Not a Contract of Employment : Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment.  
Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time.  This award does not confer any right or 
entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not 
compensation for purposes of determining severance.
Section 409A Compliance :  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended 
to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner 
consistent with such intent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the 
JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a  separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of 
death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable 
(under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to 
you during the first calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is not 
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year 
immediately following each applicable vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the 
vested portion of the award.  
Change in Outstanding Shares :  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, 
recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar 
corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable 
substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance 
pursuant to the Plan and to any RSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.
Interpretation/Administration :  The Committee has sole and complete authority to interpret and administer this Award Agreement, including, 
without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of 
employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising 
with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, 
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their 
respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By way of clarification, the 
Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective delegates and nominees shall be entitled to make non-uniform and 
selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.
Amendment :  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason; 
provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except 
to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable 
laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions 
described above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code if it is 
applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase.
Severability : If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of 
competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area 
or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.
Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity :  Upon receipt of satisfactory 
evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to 
divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase RSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before 
the required divestiture date; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 
409A of the Code.  Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “ Recovery ” section above.  The time 
period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.
If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “ Government Office 
Requirements ”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that 
section.  In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “--Job Elimination” or “--
Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award. 
Notwithstanding accelerated distribution pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if 
your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares had been distributed as scheduled as of each 
applicable vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “ Remedies ” and the employment 
restrictions in the sections captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ” and “ Government Office Requirements ” and the subsection “--Full Career 
Eligibility”.
Use of Personal Data :  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you 
this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as 
service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree 
that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we 
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect 
to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be 
cancelled.
Governing Law : This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of 
law principles. 
Choice of Forum : By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under 
an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly in connection with this award or the Plan shall be 
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the 
event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You waive, to the 
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence 
any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.
Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims : By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with 
the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual 
basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class 
action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.
Litigation : By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that  in any action or proceeding by the Firm (other than a 
derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm 
is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or 
proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the 
Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm.
Non-transferability : Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of RSUs, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, 
pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or 
by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.
Outstanding Awards : The Administrative provisions set forth above shall apply to any award of RSUs outstanding as of the date hereof, and 
such awards are hereby amended.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ______________, 20____
PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARD
OPERATING COMMITTEE
 (Protection-Based Vesting Provisions)
Award Agreement
These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of ________________, 20____ (“Grant Date”) awarding performance share units 
(“PSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement 
(all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and 
Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.
This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan.  Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner 
specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.   If you decline 
the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in “ Definitions ” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the 
Plan. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its subsidiaries as the “Firm”.
Form and Purpose of Award
Each PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the vesting date as set forth in your Award Agreement.
The purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its 
shareholders.
Protection-Based Vesting
This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date, provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting 
date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--Full Career Eligibility”, “--
Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including, 
but not limited to, sections captioned “ Number to Vest on Vesting Date ”, “Capital Ratio Performance Threshold ”, “Recapture Provisions ”, 
“Remedies ” and the following protection-based vesting provision).  
Up to a total of fifty percent of your award (including any associated Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units) that would otherwise be 
distributable to you on the vesting date (“At Risk PSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his 
or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk PSUs is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following 
factors:
•Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share 
responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may 
consider in assessing performance are: net income, total net revenue, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute 
basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. 
•For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.
•RSU awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect 
responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.  
•The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold. 
For avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur prior to the end of the 
Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the end of the Performance Period will be up to fifty 
percent of the Target Award Number.  
In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling 
you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation 
circumstances described above will continue to apply.
Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Compensation and Management 
Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such 
determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.
Number to Vest on the Vesting Date
Subject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:
Performance calculation :  On the vesting date, you will vest in a number of PSUs derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the Award 
Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table.  See sections captioned “ Calculation of Performance Ranking ” and “ Definitions ”.
You will also vest in additional shares of Common Stock as calculated under the section captioned, “ Reinvested  Dividend Equivalent Share Units ”.  
Delivery of vested shares to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last sentence of the subsection captioned “Section 
409A Compliance”.
Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units
If dividends are paid on Common Stock during the Vesting Period while the award is outstanding, you will receive on the vesting date additional units 
representing shares of Common Stock as calculated in this section.  The number, if any, will be based on the dividends that would have been paid 
during the Vesting Period as of each dividend payment date on the actual number of shares of Common Stock distributable to you resulting from the 
vesting of the PSUs, if any, and treated as reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock on each dividend payment based on the Fair Market 
Value of one share of Common Stock on each dividend payment date (“Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units”).
Holding Requirement 
As of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, you shall be entitled to be issued a number of shares of the Common Stock of JPMorgan 
Chase equal to the number of PSUs, if any, plus any additional Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, vesting on such date, less the number 
withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  The net number of shares issued to you will be held in an account in your name with restrictions 
preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such shares for a two year period commencing as 
of the vesting date and ending as of the second anniversary of the vesting date.  Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two 
year holding period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons.  See section captioned, “ Death ” and 
subsection captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by a Government Entity”.
Calculation of Performance Ranking 
For purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance Period shall be 
determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of “Average Tangible Common Equity” (if otherwise applicable), 
“Calculated PSUs”, “Firm Reported ROTCE”, “Performance Table” (including its footnote) and “ROTCE” as set forth in the “ Definitions ” section of 
these terms and conditions.  See section captioned “ Definitions ”.  Except for Firm Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the 
second place (i.e. xx.yy%), rounded to the nearest hundredth.  See section captioned, “ Definitions --Performance Table” in the event of a tie.  All 
performance based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.
Capital Ratio Performance Threshold 
Unvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below a predetermined 
threshold of ______%.
If the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to one-third of the Target 
Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year.
Vesting Period 
The period from the Grant Date to the vesting date is the “Vesting Period”. (See “Administrative Provision--Amendment” pursuant to which the Firm 
may extend the vesting period and “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered shares 
of Common Stock following the vesting date and section captioned, “Holding Period” above.)
Bonus Recoupment
In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy) as 
in effect from time to time  as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded to you for performance year 20______ and to this award.  You 
can access this policy as currently in effect by clicking the following link to the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Corporate Governance Principles web page and 
scrolling to the Bonus Recoupment Policy located under the section titled “Other Matters ”:
https://about.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/corporate-governance-principles  
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these terms and conditions in any way limits the rights of the Firm under the JPMorgan Chase Bonus 
Recoupment Policy (or successor policy).
Recapture Provisions (Detrimental Conduct, Risk-Related and Other Recapture Provisions)
Notwithstanding any terms of this Award Agreement to the contrary, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel up to 100% 
of your award (for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units as well as the Calculated PSUs) and, 
to the extent set forth in “Remedies” below, to recover from you up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the vesting date) 
of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed (including vested shares subject to the Holding Requirements and shares 
withheld for tax purposes) under this award if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
•you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm or its business activities, 
or
•this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible for the inaccuracy, or
•this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or
•you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns 
with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business activities, or
•your employment was terminated for Cause (see section captioned “ Definitions ” below) or, in the case of a determination after the termination 
of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated for Cause.

In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date 
or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed, including vested shares subject to the Holding 
Requirements, under this award as follows:
•Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery 
under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment; 
◦you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “ Your Obligations ;” or
◦you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government Office” following the 
termination of your employment.
•In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of-recovery under 
this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate pursuant to the provisions in the section captioned “ Recapture 
Provisions ”.
Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring payment under this 
subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-
recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known 
address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring 
payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall 
be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.

Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and 
conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  
Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “ Bonus Recoupment ”.
•Right to an Injunction 
You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the 
Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, 
restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to 
whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.  
Administrative Provisions 
Withholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of 
shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that 
appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include 
but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the 
extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that 
vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and vested shares 
directly to the competent authorities.  
Right to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your 
Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is 
applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe 
to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any 
funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt 
or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized 
in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.
No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations :  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of 
Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if any, and have vested.  Shares will be issued in 
accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish 
on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and 
deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation 
provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may 
be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ”, “Bonus Recoupment ”, “Recapture Provisions ”, “Termination of 
Employment ” and “ Remedies ”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)
With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in 
its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting 
the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence 
shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during 
such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to 
pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to 
such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “ Bonus Recoupment ” 
and “ Remedies ”.)   
Binding Agreement :  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.
Not a Contract of Employment : Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment.  
Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time.  This award does not confer any right or 
entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not 
compensation for purposes of determining severance.
Section 409A Compliance :  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended 
to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner 
consistent with such intent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the 
JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of 
death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable 
(under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered 
during the first calendar month after  the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is not 
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year 
immediately following the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested  portion of 
the award. 
Change in Outstanding Shares :  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, 
recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar 
corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable 
substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance 
pursuant to the Plan and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events. 
Other Equitable Adjustments: The Committee may make adjustments (up or down) to the award as it deems to be equitable, to maintain the 
intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the 
Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in 
capital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee may deem appropriate.
Interpretation/Administration :  The Committee has sole and complete authority to interpret and administer this Award Agreement, including, 
without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of 
employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising 
with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, 
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their 
respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By way of clarification, the 
Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective delegates and nominees shall be entitled to make non-uniform and 
selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.
Amendment :  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason; 
provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except 
to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable 
laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y) make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions 
described above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code if it is 
a p p l i c a b l e  t o  y o u .    T h i s  A w a r d  A g r e e m e n t  m a y  n o t  b e  a m e n d e d  e x c e p t  i n  w r i t i n g  s i g n e d  b y  t h e  D i r e c t o r  o f  H u m a n  R e s o u r c e s  o f  J P M o r g a n  C h a s e .  
Severability : If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of 
competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area 
or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.  
Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity :  Upon receipt of satisfactory 
evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to 
divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award, including Reinvested 
Dividend Equivalent Share Units, effective on or before the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no 
accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution 
under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “ Recovery ” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by 
the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.
If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “ Government Office 
Requirements ”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that 
section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full 
Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.  Subject to the two foregoing sections, the 
number of shares of Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section captioned 
“Death ”. 
To the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to divestiture requirement as forth 
herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.
Notwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the 
applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares had 
been distributed as scheduled as of the vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned 
“Remedies ” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ” and “ Government Office Requirements ” and the 
subsection “Full Career Eligibility”. 
Use of Personal Data:   By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you 
this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as 
service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree 
that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we 
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect 
to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be 
cancelled.
 
Governing Law : This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of 
law principles. 
Choice of Forum :  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under 
an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly in connection with this award or the Plan shall be 
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the 
event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District 
C o u r t  f o r  t h e  S o u t h e r n  D i s t r i c t  o f  N e w  Y o r k   w i t h  r e s p e c t  t o  a n y  j u d i c i a l  p r o c e e d i n g  i n  c o n n e c t i o n  w i t h  t h i s  a w a r d  o r  t h e  P l a n .   Y o u  w a i v e ,  t o  t h e  
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence 
any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum. 
Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:  By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with 
the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual 
basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class 
action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.
Litigation:  By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that  in any action or proceeding by the Firm (other than a 
derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm 
is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or 
proceeding.  In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the 
Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm. 
Non-transferability:  Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance based share units, nor your 
interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be

units (“PSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award 
Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the 
Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this 
award.
This award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan.  Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner 
specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.   If you decline 
the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in “ Definitions ” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the 
Plan. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its subsidiaries as the “Firm”.
Form and Purpose of Award
Each PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock following each vesting date as set forth in your Award 
Agreement.
The purpose of this award is to further emphasize sustained long-term performance and to align your interests with those of the Firm and its 
shareholders.
Protection-Based Vesting
This award is intended and expected to vest on each vesting date  set forth in your Award Agreement, provided that you are continuously employed 
by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--
Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms 
and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “ Number of Performance Share Units at the end of Performance Period ”, “Capital 
Ratio Performance Threshold ”, “Recapture Provisions ”, “Remedies ” and the following protection-based vesting provision).  
Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you as of any vesting date (“At Risk PSUs”) may be cancelled if 
the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk PSUs is 
appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:
•Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share 
responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may 
consider in assessing performance are: net income, total net revenue, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute 
basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms. 
•For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.
•RSU awards granted to participants in a Line of Business for which you exercise, or during the vesting period exercised, direct or indirect 
responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.  
•The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold. 
For avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur prior to the end of the 
Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the end of the Performance Period will be up to fifty 
percent of the Target Award Number.  
In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling 
you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation 
circumstances described above will continue to apply.
Any determination above with respect to protection-based vesting provisions is subject to ratification by the Compensation and Management 
Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such 
determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.
Number of Performance Share Units at End of Performance Period
Subject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:
Performance calculation :  The number of PSUs at the end of the Performance Period will be derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the 
Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table.  
The number of PSUs determined above will be subject to the Qualitative Performance Factor (as detailed below), which if the Committee determines 
that such an adjustment is appropriate, will be applied following the end of each year during the Performance Period, to adjust downward one-third 
of the Target Award Number of PSUs for each calendar year in the Performance Period.  Additionally, the Committee, in its discretion, may make a 
qualitative performance assessment based on the entire three year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire 
number of PSUs determined above.
See sections captioned “ Calculation of Performance Ranking ” and “ Definitions ”.
Delivery of vested shares of common stock to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last sentence of the subsection 
captioned “Section 409A Compliance”.
Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units
This award is not eligible for reinvested dividend equivalent share units.
Holding Requirement 
The net number of shares of Common Stock (after tax and all other lawful withholdings) in which you have vested, if any, as of the vesting date will 
be held in an account in your name with restrictions preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise 
encumbering such shares for (i) a twelve month period measured from each vesting date; and (ii) a two year period for such shares vesting on 
____________, 20____, with the holding periods running concurrently.  Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two year holding 
period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons.  See section captioned, “ Death ” and subsection 
captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by a Government Entity”.
Calculation of Performance Ranking 
For purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance Period shall be 
determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of “Average Tangible Common Equity” (if otherwise applicable), 
“Calculated PSUs”, “Firm Reported ROTCE”, “Performance Table” (including its footnote) and “ROTCE” as set forth in the “ Definitions ” section of 
these terms and conditions.  See section captioned “ Definitions ”.  Except for Firm Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the 
second place (i.e. xx.yy%), rounded to the nearest hundredth.  See section captioned, “ Definitions --Performance Table” in the event of a tie.  All 
performance based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.
Capital Ratio Performance Threshold 
Unvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below a predetermined 
threshold of _______%.
If the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to one-third of the Target 
Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year.
Qualitative Performance 
Determination of Qualitative Performance Factor.  Annually during the Performance Period, the Committee will formally assess your qualitative 
performance based on four broad categories: (1) Client/Customer Focus; (2) Risk, Controls & Conduct; (3) Teamwork & Leadership; and (4) Business 
Results. If the Committee determines that your performance “Meets” expectations, no downward adjustment to one-third of the Target Award 
Number of PSUs for that year shall take place (and the Qualitative Performance Factor shall be 100%). If the Committee determines that your 
performance did “Not Meet” expectations, the Committee shall determine whether a downward adjustment is appropriate, and if so, to what extent.  
A downward adjustment could result in a Qualitative Performance Factor of between 0% and 99%, depending on the circumstances.  During the 
Performance Period, a 0% Performance Factor for each year in the Performance Period would reduce your Target Award Number of PSUs to zero, 
resulting in the cancellation of award with no shares vesting. 
Additionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such assessment of your qualitative performance based on your performance during 
the entire three year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of PSUs determined  under  section 
captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at End of the Performance Period”.  In the case of a Qualitative Performance Factor of 0%, the 
award would be cancelled.
The assessment will have regard to feedback solicited from the Chair of the UK Remuneration Committee to incorporate qualitative performance 
against local regulatory responsibilities as a “Senior Manager” of the relevant CIB UK-regulated entities.
The Qualitative Performance Factor shall only be applied, if applicable, in respect of a period of your employment with the Firm, or as soon as 
administratively practical.

this award which ensure that the Firm is able to meet its regulatory obligations to operate malus (reduce) and/or clawback (recover) to awards in 
certain circumstances.  These include, but are not limited to, where (i) there is a material downturn in the Firm’s financial performance or (ii) where 
the Firm is required to hold more capital. The circumstances in which the events at (i) and (ii) would occur are analogous to some of the

Vesting provisions.

Recapture Provisions (Detrimental Conduct, Risk-Related and Other Recapture Provisions)

of your award and, to the extent set forth in “Remedies” below, to recover from you up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as 
of any vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed (including vested shares subject to the Holding 
Requirements and shares withheld for tax or other lawful purposes) under this award if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:

Death
If you die while you are eligible to vest in this award, your designated beneficiary on file with the Firm’s Stock Administration Department (or your 
estate or if no beneficiary has been designated or survives you or if beneficiary designation is not recognized by local legislation) may be entitled to 
receive a distribution of a number of shares of Common Stock associated with your award.  
Should you die after the end of the Performance Period, your beneficiary will receive shares of Common Stock equal to any outstanding PSUs.  
Should you die during the Performance Period, your Beneficiary will receive shares of Common Stock based on the average performance of all 
completed calendar years, multiplied by one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for each completed calendar year in the Performance 
Period, and using the Award Payout Percentage equal to 100 percent for any remaining calendar years in the Performance Period.  
Any shares will be distributed no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year which contains your date of death;

required documentation.
Your Obligations 
In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree to comply with and be bound by the obligations set forth below next to the subsections 
captioned “--Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers”, “--Confidential Information”, “--Non-Disparagement”, ”--Cooperation”, “--Compliance 
with Award Agreement”, and “--Notice Period”.
•Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers
During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment or, (ii) if your 
award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your 
own behalf or on behalf of any other party, without the prior written consent of the Director of Human Resources: (i) solicit, induce or 
encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has 
received official, written notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination (ii) hire any employee or former employee 
who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment terminated because his or her job 
was eliminated, or the individual’s employment with the Firm has been terminated for more than six months, (iii) to the fullest extent 
enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business 
with the Firm, any then current customers, suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to 
you by virtue of your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, suppliers or 
other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service after your employment with the Firm 
without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information. 
These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, such as employment 
decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the Firm’s policies.
•Confidential Information
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, directly or indirectly (i) use or disclose to anyone any confidential 
information related to the Firm’s business, or (ii) communicate with the press or other media about matters related to the Firm, its customers 
or employees, including matters and activities relating to your employment, or the employment of others, by the Firm, in the case of either (i) 
or (ii), except as explicitly permitted by the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct and applicable policies or law or legal process.  In addition, 
following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private and internal information 
through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  “Confidential information” shall have the same meaning for the Award Agreement as it has in 
the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct. 
Nothing in this award precludes you from reporting to the Firm’s management or directors, the government, a regulator, a self-regulatory 
agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct 
violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a 
court of law.
•Non-Disparagement
You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make or encourage others to make any public statement or release 
any information in verbal, written, electronic or any other form, that is intended to, or reasonably could be foreseen to, disparage, embarrass 
or criticize the Firm or its employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group.  This shall not preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s 
management or directors or to the government or a regulator conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or the Firm’s Code of Conduct or 
responding truthfully to questions or requests for information to the government, a regulator or in a court of law in connection with a legal or 
regulatory investigation or proceeding.
•Cooperation 
You will cooperate fully with and provide full and accurate information to the Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter (including any 
audit, tax proceeding, litigation, investigation or governmental proceeding) with respect to which you may have knowledge or information, 
subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you.
•Compliance with Award Agreement 
You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award Agreement, and you authorize 
the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be affected thereby, including your prospective employer.
•Notice Period 
If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or by policy, that requires 
you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice Period”), then as consideration for this award 
a n d  c o n t i n u e d  e m p l o y m e n t ,  y o u  w i l l  p r o v i d e  t h e  F i r m  w i t h  t h e  n e c e s s a r y  a d v a n c e  w r i t t e n  n o t i c e   t h a t  a p p l i e s  t o  y o u ,  a s  s p e c i f i e d  b y  s u c h  
c o n t r a c t  o r  p o l i c y .   
After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable Notice Period or may place you 
o n  a  p a i d  l e a v e  f o r  a l l  o r  p a r t  o f  t h e  a p p l i c a b l e  N o t i c e  P e r i o d .    D u r i n g  t h e  N o t i c e  P e r i o d ,  y o u  s h a l l  c o n t i n u e  t o  d e v o t e  y o u r  f u l l  t i m e  a n d  l o y a l t y  
to the Firm by providing services in a cooperative and professional manner and not perform any services for any other employer and shall

length of the Notice Period. 
Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period described under the subsection 
captioned “-- Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment under that same subsection.
Remedies 
•Cancellation 
In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ”, “Qualitative Performance Factor ”, 
“Bonus Recoupment ”, “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff ”, “Recapture Provisions ” and “ Termination of Employment ”, your 
outstanding PSUs under this award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
• you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions applicable to your 
termination of employment, or
• you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “ Release/Certification ” by the specified deadline, or
• you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “ Your Obligations ”.
To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this 
award and/or distribution of shares under this award, including, without limitation, during any period that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating 
whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are 
satisfied.  The Firm is not responsible for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will be 
reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures.  See also “ Administrative Provisions -No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.
•Recovery
In addition to cancellation of outstanding PSUs, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value 
(determined as of the applicable vesting date or acceleration date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed, 
including vested shares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows:
•Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery 
under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment; 
◦you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “ Your Obligations ;”  or
◦you violated the employment restrictions set forth in the subsection “Full Career Eligibility” or “Government Office” following the 
termination of your employment.
•In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of-recovery under 
this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines appropriate pursuant to the provisions in the section captioned “ Recapture 
Provisions ”.
Notice-of-recovery under this subsection is a written (including electronic) notice from the Firm to you either requiring payment under this 
subsection or stating that JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-
recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known 
address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring 
payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall 
be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.

his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.
Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and 
conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.  
Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “ Bonus Recoupment ” and “ EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff ”.
•Right to an Injunction 
You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the 
Firm, and therefore agree that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, from any court of competent jurisdiction, 
restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to 
whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.  
Administrative Provisions 
Withholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of 
shares of Common Stock required to satisfy applicable tax obligations or (ii) implement any other desirable or necessary procedures, so that 
appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include 
but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the 
extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that 
vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and vested shares 
directly to the competent authorities.  
Right to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your 
Award Agreement, the Firm may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 409A of the Code to the extent it is 
applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe 
to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any 
funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt 
or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized 
in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.
No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations :  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of 
Common Stock will be issued to you until after the number of PSUs have been determined, if any, and have vested.  Shares will be issued in 
accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish 
on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and 
deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation 
provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may 
be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ”, “Qualitative Performance Factor”, “ Bonus Recoupment ”, “EMEA 
Malus & Clawback Policy - Identified Staff ”, “Recapture Provisions ”, “Termination of Employment ” and “ Remedies ”, as well as the subsection 
captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)
With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in 
its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting 
the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence 
shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during 
such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to 
pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to 
such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “ Bonus Recoupment ” 
and “ Remedies ”.)   
Binding Agreement :  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.
Not a Contract of Employment : Nothing contained in the Award Agreement constitutes a contract of employment or continued employment.  
Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time.  This award does not confer any right or 
entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not 
compensation for purposes of determining severance.
Section 409A Compliance :  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended 
to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreement, including these terms and conditions, shall be interpreted in a manner 
consistent with such intent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the 
JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of 
death) and if any units/shares under this award represent deferred compensation as defined in Section 409A and such shares are distributable 
(under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered 
during the first calendar month after  the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is not 
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year 
immediately following each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested  portion 
of the award. 
Change in Outstanding Shares :  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, 
recapitalization, issuance of a new class of common stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other similar 
corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable 
substitution or proportionate adjustment, in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued or reserved for issuance 
pursuant to the Plan and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events. 
Other Equitable Adjustments: Except for the “Qualitative Performance Factor”, the Committee may make adjustments (up or down) to the award as 
it deems to be equitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual or non-
recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting 
methods, practices or policies, changes in capital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as 
the Committee may deem appropriate.
Interpretation/Administration :  The Committee has sole and complete authority to interpret and administer this Award Agreement, including, 
without limitation, the power to (i) interpret the Plan and the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) determine the reason for termination of 
employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising 
with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee, 
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the determinations of the Director of Human Resources, the Firm, the Committee and their 
respective delegates and nominees under the Plan and the Award Agreements are not required to be uniform.  By way of clarification, the 
Committee, the Firm, the Director of Human Resources and their respective delegates and nominees shall be entitled to make non-uniform and 
selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.
Amendment :  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason; 
provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except 
to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable 
laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y) make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions 
described above under “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”, in either case, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code if it is 
a p p l i c a b l e  t o  y o u .    T h i s  A w a r d  A g r e e m e n t  m a y  n o t  b e  a m e n d e d  e x c e p t  i n  w r i t i n g  s i g n e d  b y  t h e  D i r e c t o r  o f  H u m a n  R e s o u r c e s  o f  J P M o r g a n  C h a s e .  
Severability : If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of 
competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area 
or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.  
Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity :  Upon receipt of satisfactory 
evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to 
divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before 
the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that 
such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the 
“Recovery ” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any 
acceleration event.
If you have voluntarily terminated your employment and have satisfied the requirements of the section captioned “ Government Office 
Requirements ”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that 
section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full 
Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.  Subject to the two foregoing sections, the 
number of shares of Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section captioned 
“Death ”. 
To the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to divestiture requirement as forth 
herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.
Notwithstanding an accelerated distribution or waiver of the Holding Requirement pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the 
applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the vesting period and shares had been 
distributed as scheduled as of each vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “ Remedies ” 
and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “ Protection-Based Vesting ” and “ Government Office Requirements ” and the subsection 
“Full Career Eligibility”. 
Use of Personal Data:   By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you 
this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as 
service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree 
that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we 
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect 
to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be 
cancelled.
Governing Law : This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of 
law principles. 
Choice of Forum :  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under 
an arbitration agreement between you and the Firm, any dispute arising directly or indirectly in connection with this award or the Plan shall be 
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the 
event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District 
C o u r t  f o r  t h e  S o u t h e r n  D i s t r i c t  o f  N e w  Y o r k   w i t h  r e s p e c t  t o  a n y  j u d i c i a l  p r o c e e d i n g  i n  c o n n e c t i o n  w i t h  t h i s  a w a r d  o r  t h e  P l a n .   Y o u  w a i v e ,  t o  t h e  
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence 
any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum. 
Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:  By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with 
the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual 
basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class 
action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.
Litigation:  By accepting any award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that  in any action or proceeding by the Firm (other than a 
derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm 
is the prevailing party, the Firm shall be entitled to recover from you its reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in such action or 
proceeding.  In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the 
Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm. 
Non-transferability:  Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance based share units, nor your 
interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned, pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be 
transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.

discretionary, subject to the determination of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the

level is determined based on a holistic review of performance of the Company and Business Unit, and takes into 
consideration several key criteria including:
◦ Business Results. Client franchise and financial performance are looked at on both an absolute 
and relative basis. This review may include, but is not limited to, measures such as: Revenue, Net 
Income, Shareholder value added, and other factors such as client satisfaction, market share, 
capital and other relevant factors for a business

evaluated through business control processes, Know Your Employee and Code of Conduct 
processes, and the HR Control Forum

◦ Other factors. Major staffing decisions and other qualitative factors, including adherence to 
business principles
4.2 Participation in the Plan.  JPMorgan Chase or (if so delegated, the Business Unit or Participating 
Company) may designate an Employee as eligible for an Award (“Eligible Employee”). Such Eligible Employee may 
receive an Award; provided that
• incentive compensation is established for a Performance Year pursuant to Section 4.1,
• the performance of the Eligible Employee satisfies applicable criteria set forth in Section 4.3 for 
the Performance Year, as determined by JPMorgan Chase or its delegate.
The amount and the form of any Award shall be determined in the sole and absolute discretion of JPMorgan Chase, 
including the requirement for the execution by such Eligible Employee of such agreements as JPMorgan Chase shall 
specify. No individual Awards under this Plan are guaranteed at any time during the Performance Year; provided 
that in the case of new hire and retention agreements, an Award specified therein may guarantee as to amount but 
all other terms and conditions of this Plan shall apply.
4.3 Individual Performance Criteria.  In determining whether an Award shall be made to an 
Eligible Employee, JPMorgan Chase (or if so delegated, each Business Unit or Participating Company) shall 
measure the performance of an Eligible Employee based on its assessment of the contributions made to the 
employing Business Unit during the Performance Year using the subjective performance criteria so determined.
• Profitability – Success in
◦ Financial performance as compared to budget, prior year or competitors, including 
expense controls, net income and other financial measures.

•PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
Effective as of January 1, 2021 (as amended)
• Other criteria
◦ Generation of revenue from efforts of an Employee, including that derived from management 
of a team.
◦ Performance of complex work assignments without supervision and level of skill shown in such 
performance.
◦ Adherence to the work ethic of the Business Unit.
◦ Performance reviews exceeding expectations.
◦ Such other subjective performance-based criteria as JPMorgan Chase may deem appropriate 
for the particular job function, so long as determined within 90 days after the start of the 
Performance Year.
In evaluating the performance contribution of an Eligible Employee, those criteria that are not applicable to the job 
function or role of the Employee shall be disregarded and such determination shall be that solely of JPMorgan 
Chase. The determination of the applicable criteria and whether the Eligible Employee has satisfied such 
performance-based criteria sufficiently to be entitled to an Award shall also be in the sole discretion of JPMorgan 
Chase (or if so delegated, the management of the Business Unit or the Participating Company). Such evaluations 
shall occur as of the end of the Performance Year. By way of further clarification, the determination that any 
subjective performance criteria have been met shall not be made by the Eligible Employee or a family member of 
the Eligible Employee as defined in the final regulations promulgated under Section 409A.
SECTION 5 AWARDS
5.1 Determination of Awards.  As soon as reasonably practical following the end of the applicable 
Performance Year, and after having determined the contribution of, and
performance made by, an Eligible Employee, JPMorgan Chase (or if so delegated, the Business Unit or 
Participating Company) shall determine the amount of each individual Award.
5.2 Payment of Awards.  (a) JPMorgan Chase shall specify a payment/distribution date of the Awards 
(“Payment Date”) in the calendar year following the end of the Performance Year.
Generally, employees must be actively employed on the Payment Date specified by JPMorgan Chase in order to 
receive an Award. An individual will generally not receive Awards if they have given notice of termination and/or 
are no longer employed on the Payment Date.
Accordingly, an Eligible Employee has no interest in an Award until paid.
(b) Each individual Award shall specify the amount or percentage of the performance-based 
incentive compensation that shall be distributed in the form of cash, Stock- Based Awards or such other form as 
may be designated by JPMorgan Chase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Award Agreement of a Participant 
who is not a United States citizen and who works outside of the United States so provides, a Participating 
Company may deliver property or make contributions to a trust in lieu of providing incentive compensation 
hereunder.
(c) If JPMorgan Chase so advises and Eligible Employee agrees, the cash portion of any performance-
based incentive compensation may be deferred pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Deferred Compensation 
Program of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Participating Companies, or any successor plan or any applicable deferral 
program available to Eligible Employees who are based in locations outside the United States.
(d) The portion of any performance-based incentive compensation payable as a Stock-Based Award 
shall be granted pursuant to the terms of an approved equity compensation plan or arrangement as determined 
by JPMorgan Chase in its sole discretion.
(e) It is expressly intended that the Awards whether or not vested or immediately payable are 
designed to promote continued employment and future services from an Eligible Employee, as well as reward 
for performance.
(f) All Awards will be reflected in Award Agreements signed by an authorized officer of JPMorgan 
Chase. No employee or officer of JPMorgan Chase is authorized to make oral promises or representations about 
Awards under this Plan.PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
Effective as of January 1, 2021 (as amended)
SECTION 6
TAXES AND OTHER WITHHOLDING
Participating Companies shall have the right to (i) deduct from all amounts payable to any recipient of an Award 
(whether amounts are payable in cash), and each recipient shall make appropriate arrangements to pay the 
withholding amounts related to any taxes or other amounts required by law to be withheld, and (ii) offset any 
amounts otherwise payable hereunder by any amount the recipient owes a Participating Company, to the full 
extent permitted by law.
SECTION 7
NON-TRANSFERABILITY
No rights hereunder or Awards shall be assignable or transferable except as specified, and no right or 
interest in any Award shall be subject to any lien, obligation or liability of the Eligible Employee.
SECTION 8
NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT CONTINUED PLAN PARTICIPATION
No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be 
construed as giving the Employee recipient the right to be retained in the employ of a Participating Company. In 
addition, no Award under the Plan made during or in respect of any Performance Year or other period shall confer 
on an Employee any right or entitlement to, nor shall any Award impose any obligation on a Participating Company 
to provide, the same or any similar Award in the future, and all Plan awards are made wholly at the sole and 
unrestricted discretion of JPMorgan Chase. Further, each Participating Company expressly reserves the right at any 
time to terminate an Employee or Eligible Employee employed by it or free from any liability or any claim under the 
Plan, except as provided herein or in any Award granted hereunder.
SECTION 9 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
JPMorgan Chase may amend or terminate the Plan or any portion hereof at any time and in any manner, 
provided that the subjective individual performance criteria set forth in Section
4.3 can only be amended prior to the expiration of the Performance Year to which such criteria pertain.
SECTION 10 STATUS OF 
PLAN
The Plan is intended to constitute an “unfunded” incentive compensation plan. With respect to any 
payments not yet made to a recipient of an Award by a Participating Company, nothing herein contained shall 
provide any such individual with any rights that are greater than those of a general, unsecured creditor of the 
Participating Company. No such individual shall at any time possess any interest whatsoever in the assets of the 
Participating Company. No payments under this Plan shall be taken into account as salary or other relevant 
compensation in determining an Employee’s benefits under any compensation, pension or welfare plan (unless the 
plan specifically permits the inclusion of such Award), program or arrangement maintained by the Participating 
Company. In addition, the terms of this document and any particular Award document granted to an Employee shall 
exclusively embody the complete terms of the Plan as applied to such an individual and shall supersede any other 
documents or representations that in any way relate to any Award.
SECTION 11
WAIVER
No failure on the part of the Participating Company to exercise, and to delay in exercising, any right or 
power under the Plan shall operate as a waiver of any such right or power; nor shall any single or partial exercise 
preclude any other or further exercise of a right or power or the exercise of any other right or power.PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
Effective as of January 1, 2021 (as amended)
SECTION 12 
SEVERABILITY
Each provision of the Plan will be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective but if any 
provision shall be ruled invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction by any court of competent jurisdiction, the 
invalidity or unenforceability of such provision in such jurisdiction shall not affect any of the remaining provisions 
of the Plan and the invalid term shall be deemed to be replaced in such jurisdiction by a valid term which most 
closely reflects the intent of the Plan.
SECTION 13 
ASSIGNMENT
If JPMorgan Chase shall be merged into or consolidated with another entity, this Plan shall be binding 
upon the entity surviving such merger or resulting from such consolidation. JPMorgan Chase shall require any 
successor to all or substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s equity or assets (whether by direct or indirect purchase, 
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to, either expressly or by operation of law, assume and agree to perform 
under this Plan as if no such succession had taken place, and all references to the “JPMorgan Chase” herein shall 
become references to such successor.
SECTION 14 GOVERNING 
LAW
The validity, construction and effect of the Awards, the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the 
Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws 
principles.
SECTION 15 EFFECTIVE 
DATE
The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall continue until terminated by the JPMorgan 
Chase.PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
