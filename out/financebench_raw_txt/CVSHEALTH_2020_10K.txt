Item 1. Business.
Overview
CVS Health Corporation (“CVS Health”), togethe
r with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is a diversified health servicescompany united around a common pu
rpose of helping people on their path to better health. In an increasingly connected and digital world, we are meeting peoplewherever they are and chang
ing health care to meet their needs. The Company has more than 9,900 retail locations, approximately 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, aleading pharmacy benef
its manager with approximately 105 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one millionpatients per year and exp
anding specialty pharmacy services. We also serve an estimated 34 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directedhealth insurance products 
and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan(“PDP”). The Company believes its innova
tive health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health carecosts.
On November 28, 2018 (the “Aetna Acquisition Da
te”), the Company acquired Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”). As a result of the acquisition of Aetna (the “AetnaAcquisition”), the Company added th
e Health Care Benefits segment. Certain aspects of Aetna’s operations, including products for which the Company no longersolicits or accepts new cus
tomers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products, are included in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment. Theconsolidated financia
l statements reflect Aetna’s results subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Date.The Company has four reportable s
egments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC, Health Care Benefits and Corporate/Other.COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely imp
acted the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. Beginning in March 2020, the effects of theCOVID-19 pandemic began to emerge in 
the U.S. The Company executed preparedness plans to maintain continuity of its operations, including transitioning manyoffice-based colle
agues to a remote work environment and installing protective equipment in our retail pharmacies. The Company also provided enhanced benefitsto its colleagues, inclu
ding bonuses to frontline colleagues, dependent care financial assistance, paid sick leave for part-time colleagues and paid time off tocolleagues who test positive o
r are quarantined due to exposure to COVID-19.Our strong local presence and s
cale in communities across the country enabled us to play an indispensable role in the national response to COVID-19, as well asprovide seamless support for ou
r customers wherever they needed us: in our CVS locations, in their homes, and virtually. The Company offered COVID-19diagnostic testing at mo
re than 4,000 CVS Pharmacy locations as of December 31, 2020 and launched critical diagnostic testing for the vulnerable seniorpopulation in long-term c
are facilities in partnership with three states. The Company was also selected to administer COVID-19 vaccines in both long-term carefacilities and its retail pharmacies.
 The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccinations in long-term care facilities and in certain of its retail pharmaciesduring December 2020 and February 2021, r
espectively, and expects to play a significant role in COVID-19 vaccine administration in the future. In the Health CareBenefits segment, the Company a
lso expanded benefit coverage to its members, including cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 related treatments, as well asassistance to members 
through premium credits, telehealth cost-sharing waivers and other investments.The impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s businesses, op
erating results, cash flows and financial condition in the year ended December 31, 2020, as well asinformation regarding 
certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this 10-K.Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration,formulary management, retail pharmac
y network management services, mail order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, diseasemanagement services 
and medical spend management. The Pharmacy Services segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions,government employee groups, he
alth plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care (“Managed Medicaid”) plans, plans offered on public health insurance exchanges(“Public Exchanges”) and priv
ate health insurance exchanges (“Private Exchanges” and together with Public Exchanges, “Insurance Exchanges”) and othersponsors of health benefit pl
ans throughout the United States. The®2

Pharmacy Services segment includes retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compoundingpharmacies and branches 
for infusion and enteral nutrition services. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s PBM filled or managed 2.1 billionprescriptions on a 30-day equiv
alent basis.PBM Services
The Company dispenses prescription d
rugs directly through its mail order dispensing and specialty mail order pharmacies and through pharmacies in its retailnetwork. All prescriptions proc
essed by the Company are analyzed, processed and documented by the Company’s proprietary prescription management systems.These systems provide essenti
al features and functionality to allow plan members to utilize their prescription drug benefits. These systems also streamline theprocess by which prescriptions a
re processed by staff and network pharmacists by enhancing review of various items through automation, including plan eligibility,early refills, duplicate dispe
nsing, appropriateness of dosage, drug interactions or allergies, over-utilization and potential fraud.Plan Design Offerings and Administration
The Company administers pharm
acy benefit plans for clients who contract with it to facilitate prescription drug coverage and claims processing for their eligibleplan members. The Company assists 
its PBM clients in designing pharmacy benefit plans that help improve health outcomes while minimizing the costs to theclient. The Company also assists PBM cl
ients in monitoring the effectiveness of their plans through frequent, informal communications, the use of proprietarysoftware, as well as through for
mal annual, quarterly and sometimes monthly performance reviews.The Company makes recommenda
tions to help PBM clients design benefit plans that promote the use of lower cost, clinically appropriate drugs and helps its PBMclients control costs by r
ecommending plan designs that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available. Clientsalso have the option, through plan d
esign, to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different member payment levels for different products ontheir drug lists or “for
mularies,” which helps guide members to choose lower cost alternatives through appropriate financial incentives.Formulary Management
The Company utilizes an independ
ent panel of doctors, pharmacists and other medical experts, referred to as the CVS Caremark National Pharmacy andTherapeutics Committe
e, to review and approve the selection of drugs that meet the Company’s standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on one of theCompany’s template formu
laries. The Company’s formularies provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to help ensure member access to clinicallyappropriate drugs with alt
ernatives within a class under the client’s pharmacy benefit plan, while helping to drive the lowest net cost for clients that select one ofthe Company’s formularies. To h
elp improve clinical outcomes for members and clients, the Company conducts ongoing, independent reviews of all drugs,including those appearing on th
e formularies and generic equivalent products. Many of the Company’s clients choose to adopt a template formulary offering as partof their plan design. PBM clients 
are given capabilities to offer real time benefits information for a member’s specific plan design, provided digitally at the point ofprescribing, at the pharmac
y and directly to members.Retail Pharmacy Network
 Management ServicesThe Company maintains a nation
al network of approximately 66,000 retail pharmacies, consisting of approximately 40,000 chain pharmacies (which includes CVSPharmacy locations) and app
roximately 26,000 independent pharmacies, in the United States, including Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S.Virgin Islands. When a custome
r fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy sends prescription data electronically to the Company from the point-of-sale. This data interfaces 
with the Company’s proprietary prescription management systems, which verify relevant plan member data and eligibility, while alsoperforming a drug utilizatio
n review to help evaluate clinical appropriateness and safety and confirming that the pharmacy will receive payment for theprescription. The Company also of
fers a performance program for non-Medicare customers, which can be implemented with either the Company’s broad, nationalnetwork or with any managed network (
as allowed by applicable laws and regulations). Under the program, high performing pharmacies are eligible to receive anincremental positiv
e performance payment. The program aligns with key Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set measures utilized by the U.S. Centers forMedicare & Medicaid Se
rvices (“CMS”) and is funded by client fees. Mail Order Pharmacy Services
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t operates mail order dispensing pharmacies in the United States. Plan members or their prescribers submit prescriptions or refillrequests, primarily for mainte
nance medications, to these pharmacies, and staff pharmacists review these prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of theCompany’s prescription manag
ement systems. This review may involve communications with the prescriber and, with the prescriber’s approval when required, canresult in generic substi
tution, therapeutic interchange or other actions designed to help reduce cost and/or improve quality of3

treatment. The Company’s mail order dispensing pharmacies have been awarded Mail Service Pharmacy accreditation from URAC, a health care accreditingorganization that establishe
s quality standards for the health care industry.Specialty Pharmacy and Infusion Serv
icesThe Pharmacy Services
 segment operates specialty mail order pharmacies, retail specialty pharmacy stores and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition servicesin the United States. The speci
alty mail order pharmacies are used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases anddisorders. The Company’s special
ty mail order pharmacies also have been awarded Specialty Pharmacy accreditation from URAC. Substantially all of theCompany’s specialty mail o
rder pharmacies also have been accredited by The Joint Commission, which is an independent, not-for-profit organization that accreditsand certifies heal
th care programs and organizations in the United States.Clinical Services
The Company offers
 multiple clinical programs and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner.These programs are primarily
 designed to promote better health outcomes and to help target inappropriate medication utilization and non-adherence to medication,each of which may result in 
adverse medical events that negatively affect member health and client pharmacy and medical spend. These programs includeutilization manage
ment (“UM”), medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement the client’s plan design andclinical strateg
ies. To help address prescription opioid abuse and misuse, the Company introduced an industry-leading UM approach that limits to seven days thesupply of opioids dispensed for cer
tain acute prescriptions for patients who are new to therapy, limits the daily dosage of opioids dispensed based on the strength ofthe opioid and requires the us
e of immediate-release formulations of opioids before extended-release opioids are dispensed. The Company’s Pharmacy Advisorprogram facilitates pharmacist cou
nseling, both face-to-face and over the telephone, to help participating plan members with certain chronic diseases, such asdiabetes and cardiovascu
lar conditions, to identify gaps in care, adhere to their prescribed medications and manage their health conditions. The Company also hasdigital connectivity 
that helps to lower drug costs for patients by providing expanded visibility to lower cost alternatives through enhanced analytics and datasharing.
Disease Management Programs
The Company’s clinical progr
ams and services utilize advanced protocols and offer clients convenience in working with health care providers (“providers”) andother third parties. The Comp
any’s UM program covers diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, seizure disorders and multiple sclerosis and isaccredited by the Nation
al Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”), a private, not-for-profit organization that evaluates, accredits and certifies a wide range ofhealth care organizations.
Medical Benefit Management
The Company’s NovoLogix
online preauthorizat ion tool helps identify and capture cost savings opportunities for specialty drugs billed under the medical benefitby identifying outliers to 
appropriate dosages and costs, and helps to ensure clinically appropriate use of specialty drugs.Group Purchasing Organization Services
The Company operate
s a group purchasing organization that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturerson behalf of its partic
ipants. The Company also provides various administrative, management and reporting services to pharmaceutical manufacturers.Pharmacy Services Information Systems
The Pharmacy Services
 segment’s claim adjudication platform incorporates architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail order prescriptions,adjudicating retai
l pharmacy claims and delivering other solutions to PBM clients. The Health Engagement Engine technology and proprietary clinical algorithmshelp connect the various pa
rts of the enterprise and serve an essential role in cost management and health improvement, leveraging cloud-native technologies andpractices. This capability tra
nsforms pharmacy data into actionable interventions at key points of care, including in retail, mail and specialty pharmacies as well asin customer care call center operati
ons, leveraging our enterprise data platform to improve the quality of care. The technology leverages assisted artificialintelligence to del
iver insights to the business and bring automation to otherwise manual tasks. Specialty services also connects with our claim adjudicationplatform and various healt
h plan adjudication platforms with a centralized architecture servicing many clients and members. Operating services, such as SpecialtyExpedite
, provide an interconnect ed onboarding solution for specialty medications and branding solutions ranging from fulfillment to total patient management.These services are man
aged through our new innovative specialty workflow and web platform.®®

Pharmacy Services ClientsThe Company’s Pharmacy Services c
lients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Medicare Part Dplans, Managed Medicaid plans 
and plans offered on Insurance Exchanges and other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States. Pharmaceuticalsare provided to eligibl
e members in benefit plans maintained by clients and utilize the Company’s information systems, among other things, to help perform safetychecks, drug interaction s
creening and identify opportunities for generic substitution. Substantially all of the Pharmacy Services segment’s revenues are generatedfrom dispensing and managing pr
escription drugs to eligible members in benefit plans maintained by clients. In 2018, revenues from Aetna accounted forapproximately 9.8% of the Comp
any’s consolidated total revenues. On the Aetna Acquisition Date, Aetna became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health.Subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Dat
e, revenues from Aetna continue to be reported in the Pharmacy Services segment; however, these revenues are eliminatedin the consolidated finan
cial statements.Pharmacy Services Seasonality
The majority of Pharmacy Se
rvices segment revenues are not seasonal in nature.Pharmacy Services Competition
The Company believe
s the primary competitive factors in the pharmacy services industry include: (i) the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drugmanufacturers as well as t
o negotiate favorable discounts from, and access to, retail pharmacy networks; (ii) the ability to identify and apply effective costmanagement programs utilizing
 clinical strategies, including the development and utilization of preferred formularies; (iii) the ability to market PBM products andservices; (iv) the co
mmitment to provide flexible, clinically-oriented services to clients and be responsive to clients’ needs; (v) the quality, scope and costs ofproducts and services offe
red to clients and their members; and (vi) operational excellence in delivering services. The Pharmacy Services segment has a significantnumber of competitors of
fering PBM services, including large, national PBM companies (e.g., Prime Therapeutics and MedImpact), PBMs owned by largenational health plans (
e.g., the Express Scripts business of Cigna Corporation and the OptumRx business of UnitedHealth) and smaller standalone PBMs.Retail/LTC Segment
The Retail/LTC segment sells p
rescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care servicesthrough its MinuteClinic
 walk-in medical clin ics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 andshingles and conducts long-ter
m care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and otherancillary services 
to chronic care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2020, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations,approximately 1,100 MinuteClin
ic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. During the year endedDecember 31, 2020, the Retail/LTC seg
ment filled 1.5 billion prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Companydispensed approximately 27.1% o
f the total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the United States.Retail/LTC Products and Services
A typical retail stor
e sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and proprietary brand merchandise. Frontstore categories inc
lude over-the-counter drugs, consumer health products, beauty products and personal care products. LTC operations include distribution ofprescription drugs and rel
ated consulting and ancillary services. The Company purchases merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors. TheCompany believes that compe
titive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products carried in its retail stores and the loss of any one supplierwould not likely have a mate
rial effect on the Retail/LTC segment. The Company’s MinuteClinic locations offer a variety of health care services.®5

Retail/LTC revenues by major product group are as follows:Percentage of Revenues
2020
2019 2018 Pharmacy 
76.9 % 76.7 % 76.4 % Front store and other 
23.1 % 23.3 % 23.6 % 100.0 
% 100.0 % 100.0 % (1)
Pharmacy includes LTC sales and sales in pharmacies within Target Corporation (“Target”) and other retail stores. (2)
“Other” represents less than 10% of the “Front store and other” revenue category. Pharmacy
Pharmacy revenues repres
ented approximately three-fourths of Retail/LTC segment revenues in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company believes that retailpharmacy operations will 
continue to represent a critical part of the Company’s business due to industry demographics, e.g., an aging American populationconsuming a greater numbe
r of prescription drugs, prescription drugs being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness, the introduction ofnew pharmaceutical produ
cts, the need for vaccinations and Medicare Part D growth. The Company believes the retail pharmacy business benefits from investmentin both people and technology, as wel
l as innovative collaborations with health plans, PBMs and providers. Given the nature of prescriptions, consumers want theirprescriptions filled 
accurately by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology, and ready when promised. Consumers also need medicationmanagement programs and b
etter information to help them get the most out of their health care dollars. To assist consumers with these needs, the Company hasintroduced integrated pharmac
y health care services that provide an earlier, easier and more effective approach to engaging consumers in behaviors that can helplower costs, improve health 
and save lives.Front Store
Front store revenues refl
ect the Company’s strategy of innovating with new and unique products and services, using innovative personalized marketing andadjusting the mix of mer
chandise to match customers’ needs and preferences. A key component of the front store strategy is the ExtraCare card program, which is one of the largest and most su
ccessful retail loyalty programs in the United States. The ExtraCare program allows the Company to balance marketing efforts so itcan reward its best custom
ers by providing them with automatic sale prices, customized coupons, ExtraBucks rewards and other benefits. Th e Company alsooffers a subscription-bas
ed membership program, CarePass, under which members are en titled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscriptionperiod, as well as a promotion
al reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. The Company continues to launch and enhance new and exclusivebrands to create unmat
ched offerings in beauty products and deliver other unique product offerings, including a full range of high-quality CVS Health and other proprietary brand products 
that are only available through CVS stores. The Company currently carries approximately 6,000 CVS Health and proprietary brandproducts, which accounted for app
roximately 24% of front store revenues during 2020.MinuteClinic
As of December 31, 2020, the Company operat
ed approximately 1,100 MinuteClinic locations in the United States. The clinics are staffed by nurse practitionersand physician assistants who util
ize nationally established guidelines to deliver a variety of health care services. Payors value these clinics because they provideconvenient, high-qualit
y, cost-effective care, in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more expensive sites of care. MinuteClinic is collaborating with thePharmacy Services and Health Ca
re Benefits segments to help meet the needs of CVS Caremark’s client plan members and the Company’s health plan members byoffering programs that 
can improve member health and lower costs. MinuteClinic also maintains relationships with leading hospitals, clinics and physicians in thecommunities we serve to suppor
t and enhance quality, access and continuity of care.On-site Pharmacies
The Company also operates a li
mited number of pharmacies located at client sites, which provide certain health plan members and customers with a convenientalternative for filling their prescri
ptions.Medical Diagnostic Testing
The Company provides medical di
agnostic testing primarily through its COVID-19 testing sites located at CVS Pharmacy locations as well as in long-term carefacilities, at co
mmunity-based testing sites in underserved areas, large-scale rapid test sites in select states, and through its Return Readysolution. (1)(2)

Long-term Care Pharmacy OperationsThe Retail/LTC segment provides LTC pha
rmacy services through the Omnicare business. Omnicare’s custome rs consist of skilled nursing facilities, assistedliving facilities, independe
nt living communities, hospitals, correctional facilities, and other health care service providers. The Company provides pharmacyconsulting, including monthly pa
tient drug therapy evaluations, to assist in compliance with state and federal regulations and provide proprietary clinical and healthmanagement programs. It als
o provides pharmaceutical case management services for retirees, employees and dependents who have drug benefits under corporate-sponsored health care progr
ams.Community Location Development
The addition of new community lo
cations has played, and will continue to play, a key role in the Company’s continued growth and success. The Company’scommunity location deve
lopment program focuses on three areas: entering new service areas, adding locations within existing service areas and relocating to moreconvenient sites. During 2020, the Company op
ened approximately 55 new community locations, relocated approximately 20 locations, converted approximately600 locations into HealthHUB
locations and closed approximately 90 locations.The Company operated over 650 HealthHUB loca
tions as of December 31, 2020. HealthHUBs have a redesigned format that provide enhanced services, offer acare concierge and fo
cus on health and wellness products. HealthHUBs are designed to meet consumer needs and improve the customer experience by providingcare that complem
ents physician practices and hospital systems, enabling improved health outcomes and reducing overall health care costs. The Company expectsto continue HealthHUB conversions through 2021 and 
into 2022.During the last five years, 
the Company opened approximately 640 new and relocated retail pharmacies, and acquired approximately 225 locations. The Companybelieves that continuing 
to assess the appropriateness of its national footprint and identifying more accessible locations are essential components of competingeffectively in the current health
 care environment. As a result, the Company believes that its community location development program is an integral part of itsability to meet the n
eeds of customers and maintain its leadership position in the pharmacy marketplace given the changing health care landscape.Retail/LTC Information Systems
The Company has continued to invest in 
information systems to enable it to deliver exceptional customer service, enhance safety and quality, and expand patientcare services while lowe
ring operating costs. The proprietary WeCARE Workflow tool supports pharmacy teams by prioritizing work to meet customerexpectations, facilitating prescri
ber outreach, and seamlessly integrating clinical programs. This solution delivers improved efficiency and enhances customerexperience, as well as prov
ides a framework to accommodate the evolution of pharmacy practice and the expansion of clinical programs. Our Health EngagementEngine technology a
nd data science clinical algorithms enable the Company to help identify opportunities for pharmacists to deliver face-to-face counselingregarding patient hea
lth and safety matters, including medication adherence issues, gaps in care and management of certain chronic health conditions. TheCompany’s digital strategy 
is to empower the consumer to navigate their pharmacy experience and manage their condition through integrated online and mobilesolutions that offer uti
lity and convenience. The Company’s LTC digital technology suite, Omniview, improves the effici ency of customers’ operations with toolsthat include executive das
hboards, pre-admission pricing, electronic ordering of prescription refills, proof-of-delivery tracking, access to patient profiles, receiptand management of facility bill
s, and real-time validation of Medicare Part D coverage, among other capabilities.Retail/LTC Customers
The success of the Retail/LTC seg
ment’s businesses is dependent upon the Company’s ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with pharmacybenefit managers and oth
er payors on acceptable terms. Substantially all of the Retail/LTC segment’s pharmacy revenues are derived from pharmacy benefitmanagers, managed car
e organizations (“MCOs”), government funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third-party payors. No singleRetail/LTC payor accounted fo
r 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated total revenues in 2020, 2019 or 2018.Retail/LTC Seasonality
The majority of Retail
/LTC segment revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, generally are not seasonal in nature. However, front store revenues tend to behigher during the December ho
liday season. In addition, both pharmacy and front store revenues are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and fluseason. Uncharacteristi
c or extreme weather conditions also can adversely affect consumer shopping patterns and Retail/LTC revenues, expenses and operatingresults.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the quarterly earnings progression was also impacted by COVID-19. During March 2020, the Company experiencedgreater use of 90-day pres
criptions, early refills of maintenance medications and increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic.Subsequent to March 2020, the Company exper
ienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-place orders aswell as reduced new therapy pr
escriptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the third quarter, the Company saw an increase in diagnostic testingrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and in December 2020, the Company began administering COVID-19 vaccinations in long-term care facilities.Retail/LTC Competition
The retail pharmacy bus
iness is highly competitive. The Company believes that it competes principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience,(ii) customer servi
ce and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety, and (iv) price. In the areas it serves, the Company competes with other drugstore chains(e.g., Walgreens and Rite Aid), sup
ermarkets, discount retailers (e.g., Walmart), independent pharmacies, restrictive pharmacy networks, membershipclubs, internet compani
es (e.g., Amazon), and retail health clinics (including urgent care centers), as well as mail order dispensing pharmacies.LTC pharmacy services are h
ighly regional or local in nature, and within a given geographic area of operation, highly competitive. The Company’s largest LTCpharmacy competitor n
ationally is PharMerica. The Company also competes with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned bylong-term care facilities and local retail
 pharmacies. Some states have enacted “freedom of choice” or “any willing provider” requirements as part of their stateMedicaid programs or in
 separate legislation, which may increase the competition that the Company faces in providing services to long-term care facility residentsin these states.
Health Care Benefits Segment
The Health Care Benefits segm
ent is one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers, serving an estimated 34 million people as ofDecember 31, 2020. The Health Care Bene
fits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals,make more informed decision
s about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directedhealth insurance product
s and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, MedicareAdvantage and Medicare Supplem
ent plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology (“HIT”) products and services.The Health Care Benefits segm
ent also provided workers’ compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers’ Compensationbusiness (“Workers’ Compensat
ion business”) prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment’s customers include employergroups, individuals, college stud
ents, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsoredplans, labor groups and expatri
ates. For periods prior to the Aetna Acquisition Date, the Health Care Benefits segment was comprised only of the Company’sSilverScript
 PDP business. Health Care Benefits Products and Services
The Company refers to insuranc
e products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative servicescontract products (where 
the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” Health Care Benefits products andservices consist of the fo
llowing:•
Commercial Medical: The Health Care Benefits seg ment offers point-of-service (“POS”), preferred provider organization (“PPO”), health maintenanceorganization (“HMO”) and inde
mnity benefit (“Indemnity”) plans. Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts (“HSAs”) andconsumer-directed he
alth plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account(which may be funded by the plan sponsor 
and/or the member in the case of HSAs). Principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-sitenational, mid-sized and s
mall employers, individual insureds and expatriates. The Company offers medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employerswho elect to self-insure 
their health benefits. Under medical stop loss insurance products, the Company assumes risk for costs associated with large individualclaims and/or aggrega
te loss experience within an employer’s plan above a pre-set annual threshold.•
Government Medical: In select geographies, the Health Care Benefits segment offers Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Supplement plans and prescriptiondrug coverage for Medica
re beneficiaries; participates in Medicaid and subsidized Children’s Health Insurance Programs (“CHIP”); and participates indemonstration projects 
for members who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (“Duals”). These Government Medical products are further describedbelow:
®8

•Medicare Advantage: Through annual contracts with CMS, the Company o ffers HMO and PPO products for eligible individuals in certain geographicareas through the Medicare
 Advantage program. Members typically receive enhanced benefits over traditional fee-for-service Medicare coverage(“Original Medicare
”), including reduced cost-sharing for preventive care, vision and other services. The Company offered network-based HMOand/or PPO plans in 45 states and Washington, D.C. in 2020. The Comp
any has expanded to 46 states and Washington, D.C. for 2021. For certainqualifying employer groups, th
e Company offers Medicare PPO products nationally. When combined with the Company’s PDP product, thesenational PPO plans form an integr
ated national Insured Medicare product for employers that provides medical and pharmacy benefits.•
Medicare PDP: The Company is a national provide r of drug benefits under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. All Medicare eligibleindividuals are eligible to
 participate in this voluntary prescription drug plan. Members typically receive coverage for certain prescription drugs,usually subject to a deduct
ible, co-insurance and/or co-payment. On November 30, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Aetna’s standalonePDPs to WellCare Health Plans, Inc. ef
fective December 31, 2018. The Company provided administrative services to, and retained the financialresults of, the divested pl
ans through 2019. Subsequent to 2019, the Company no longer retains the financial results of the divested plans.•
Medicare Supplement: For certain Medicare eligible mem bers, the Company offers supplemental coverage for certain health care costs not coveredby Original Medicare. The produ
cts included in the Medicare Supplement portfolio help to cover some of the gaps in Original Medicare, and includecoverage for Medicar
e deductibles and coinsurance amounts. The Company offered a wide selection of Medicare Supplement products in 49 statesand Washington, D.C. in 2020.
•
Medicaid and CHIP: The Company offers health ca re management services to individuals eligible for Medicaid and CHIP under multi-year contractswith government agencies in v
arious states that are subject to annual appropriations. CHIP are state-subsidized insurance programs that providebenefits for famil
ies with uninsured children. The Company offered these services on an Insured or ASC basis in 16 states in 2020.•
Duals: The Company provides health cover age to beneficiaries who are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage. These membersmust meet certain 
income and resource requirements in order to qualify for this coverage. The Company coordinates 100% of the care for thesemembers and may provide th
em with additional services in order to manage their health care costs.•
Specialty and Strategic Solutions: The Health Care Benefits seg ment has a portfolio of additional health products and services that complement its medicalproducts such as dental plans, beh
avioral health and employee assistance products, provider network access and vision products. The Company also has aportfolio of transform
ative products and services aimed at creating a holistic and integrated approach to individual health and wellness. These products andservices complement 
the Commercial Medical and Government Medical products and aim to provide innovative solutions, create integrated experienceofferings and enable enhan
ced care delivery to customers.Health Care Benefits Provider Networks
The Company contracts with physici
ans, hospitals and other providers for services they provide to the Company’s members. The Company uses a variety oftechniques designed t
o help encourage appropriate utilization of medical services (“utilization”) and maintain affordability of quality coverage. In addition tocontracts with provider
s for negotiated rates of reimbursement, these techniques include creating risk sharing arrangements that align economic incentives withproviders, the development 
and implementation of guidelines for the appropriate utilization and the provision of data to providers to enable them to improve healthcare quality. At Decembe
r 31, 2020, the Company’s underlying nationwide provider network had approximately 1.4 million participating providers. Otherproviders in the Company’s provide
r networks also include laboratory, imaging, urgent care and other freestanding health facilities.Health Care Benefits Quality Assessment
CMS uses a 5-star rating system to 
monitor Medicare health care and drug plans and ensure that they meet CMS’s quality standards. CMS uses this rating systemto provide Medicare beneficiarie
s with a tool that they can use to compare the overall quality of care and level of customer service of companies that provideMedicare health ca
re and drug plans. The rating system considers a variety of measures adopted by CMS, including quality of preventative services, chronic illnessmanagement and overal
l customer satisfaction. See “Health Care Benefits Pricing” below in this Item 1 for further discussion of star ratings. The Company seeksHealth Plan accredita
tion for Aetna HMO plans from the NCQA. Health care plans seeking accreditation must pass a rigorous, comprehensive review and mustannually report on their p
erformance.9

Aetna Life Insurance Company (“ALIC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has received nationwide NCQA PPO Health Plan accreditation. As ofDecember 31, 2020, all of the Company
’s Commercial HMO and all of ALIC’s PPO members who were eligible participated in HMOs or PPOs that are accreditedby the NCQA.
The Company’s provider select
ion and credentialing/re-credentialing policies and procedures are consistent with NCQA and URAC, as well as state and federal,requirements. In addit
ion, the Company is certified under the NCQA Credentials Verification Organization (“CVO”) certification program for all certificationoptions and has URAC CVO accreditation.
Quality assessment programs 
for contracted providers who participate in the Company’s networks begin with the initial review of health care practitioners.Practitioners’ lic
enses and education are verified, and their work history is collected by the Company or in some cases by the practitioner’s affiliated group ororganization. The Company gener
ally requires participating hospitals to be certified by CMS or accredited by The Joint Commission, the American OsteopathicAssociation, or Det Norske Veritas Hea
lthcare.The Company also offers quality 
and outcome measurement programs, quality improvement programs, and health care data analysis systems to providers andpurchasers of health ca
re services.Health Care Benefits Information Systems
The Health Care Benefits segm
ent currently operates and supports an end-to-end suite of information technology platforms to support member engagement,enrollment, health benefit admi
nistration, care management, service operations, financial reporting and analytics. The multiple platforms are supported by anintegration layer to facilitate the tra
nsfer of real-time data. There is continued focus and investment in enterprise data platforms, cloud capabilities, digital productsto offer innovative solut
ions and a seamless experience to the Company’s members through mobile and web channels. The Company is making concertedinvestments in emerging tec
hnology capabilities such as voice, artificial intelligence and robotics to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience forall of its constituents. Th
e Health Care Benefits segment is utilizing the full breadth of the Company’s assets to build enterprise technology that will help guide ourmembers through their he
alth care journey, provide them a high level of service, enable healthier outcomes and encourage them to take next best actions to leadhealthier lives.
Health Care Benefits Customers
Medical membership is d
ispersed throughout the United States, and the Company also serves medical members in certain countries outside the United States. TheCompany offers a broad range of 
traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, many of which are availablenationwide. Depending on the product, th
e Company markets to a range of customers including employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time andhourly workers, health plans, provid
ers, governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. For additional information on medicalmembership, see “Health Ca
re Benefits Segment” in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the “MD&A”)included in Item 7 of this 10
-K.The Company markets both Commerc
ial Insured and ASC products and services primarily to employers that sponsor the Company’s products for the benefit oftheir employees and the
ir employees’ dependents. Frequently, larger employers offer employees a choice among coverage options, from which the employeemakes his or her select
ion during a designated annual open enrollment period. Typically, employers pay all of the monthly premiums to the Company and,through payroll deductions, obta
in reimbursement from employees for a percentage of the premiums that is determined by each employer. Some Health CareBenefits products are sold di
rectly to employees of employer groups on a fully employee-funded basis. In some cases, the Company bills the covered individualdirectly.
The Company offers Insured Medic
are coverage on an individual basis as well as through employer groups to their retirees. Medicaid and CHIP members areenrolled on an individual bas
is. The Company also offers Insured health care coverage to members who are dually-eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.Health Care Benefits products 
are sold through: the Company’s sales personnel; independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production andservicing of business; and Priva
te Exchanges. For large plan sponsors, independent consultants and brokers are frequently involved in employer health planselection decisions and sa
les. In some instances, the Company may pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents, consultants and salesrepresentatives who plac
e business with the Company. In certain cases, the customer pays the broker for services rendered, and the Company may facilitate thatarrangement by colle
cting the funds from the customer and transmitting them to the broker. The Company10

supports marketing and sales efforts with an advertising program that may include television, radio, billboards, print media and social media, supplemented bymarket research and direct marketin
g efforts.The U.S. federal government is a s
ignificant customer of the Health Care Benefits segment through contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligibleindividuals and federal 
employee-related benefit programs. Other than the contracts with CMS, the Health Care Benefits segment is not dependent upon a singlecustomer or a few custome
rs the loss of which would have a significant effect on the earnings of the segment. The loss of business from any one, or a few,independent brokers or agents would no
t have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the Health Care Benefits segment. In both 2020 and 2019, Health CareBenefits segment revenues 
from the federal government accounted for 13% of the Company’s consolidated total revenues. Contracts with CMS for coverage ofMedicare-eligibl
e individuals in the Health Care Benefits segment accounted for approximately 92% of the Company’s consolidated revenues from the federalgovernment in both 2020 and 2019. No single Heal
th Care Benefits customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated total revenues in 2018.Health Care Benefits Pricing
For Commercial Insured plans, 
contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period andtypically have a durat
ion of one year. Fees under ASC plans are generally fixed for a period of one year.Generally, a fixed prem
ium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period for Commercial Insured plans. The Company typically cannot recoverunanticipated incre
ases in health care and other benefit costs in the current policy period; however, it may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregateor for a specific customer,
 among other factors, in determining premium rates for future policy periods. Where required by state laws, premium rates are filed andapproved by state regulato
rs prior to contract inception. Future operating results could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved orare adjusted downward or their 
approval is delayed by state or federal regulators.The Company has Medicare Advantage 
and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certaingeographic areas. Under thes
e annual contracts, CMS pays the Company a fixed per member (or “capitation”) payment and/or a portion of the premium, both ofwhich are based on membership 
and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors. CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and average percapita fee-for-service Medicare costs
 in the calculation of the fixed capitation payment or premium. PDP contracts also provide a risk-sharing arrangement withCMS to limit the Company’s exposure to un
favorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses. Amounts payable to the Company under the Medicarearrangements are subj
ect to annual revision by CMS, and the Company elects to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis. Premiumspaid to the Company for Medica
re products are subject to federal government reviews and audits, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive andprospective premium ad
justments and refunds to the government and/or members. In addition to payments received from CMS, some Medicare Advantageproducts and all PDP products require 
a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer. In some cases these supplemental premiums areadjusted based on the membe
r’s income and asset levels. Compared to Commercial Medical products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member per monthrevenues and higher health 
care and other benefit costs.The Patient Protection and Affo
rdable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) ties a portion of eachMedicare Advantage plan’s 
reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments.CMS released the Company’s 2021 star r
atings in October 2020. The Company’s 2021 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company’s MedicareAdvantage plans have ratings of 
four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2022. Based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2020, 83% ofthe Company’s Medicare Advantag
e members were in plans with 2021 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, consistent with 83% of the Company’s Medicare Advantagemembers being in plans with 2020 st
ar ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2019.Rates for Medicare Supplem
ent products are regulated at the state level and vary by state and plan.Under Insured Medicaid contr
acts, state government agencies pay the Company fixed monthly rates per member that vary by state, line of business anddemographics; and the Company a
rranges, pays for and manages the health care services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. These rates are subject to change byeach state, and, in some ins
tances, provide for adjustment for health risk factors. CMS requires these rates to be actuarially sound. The Company also receivesfees from customers wher
e it provides services under ASC Medicaid contracts. ASC Medicaid contracts generally are for periods of more than one year, andcertain of them contain performa
nce incentives and limited financial risk sharing with respect to certain medical, financial11

and operational metrics. Under these arrangements, performance is evaluated annually, with associated financial incentive opportunities, and financial risk shareobligations are typica
lly limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company. Payments to the Company under Medicaid contracts are subject tothe annual appropriation p
rocess in the applicable state.Under Duals contracts, the ra
te setting process is generally established by CMS in partnership with the state government agency participating in thedemonstration project. Both CMS and th
e state government agency may seek premium and other refunds under certain circumstances, including if the Companyfails to comply with CMS regulat
ions or other contractual requirements.The Company offers HMO and consumer-dir
ected medical and dental plans to federal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Programand the Federal Employees Dent
al and Vision Insurance Program. Premium rates and fees for those plans are subject to federal government review and audit,which can result, and have resu
lted, in retroactive and prospective premium and fee adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members.Beginning in 2014, the ACA imposed significant n
ew industry-wide fees, assessments and taxes, including an annual levy known as the health insurer fee (the“HIF”). The HIF applies for both 2020 and 2018 and was t
emporarily suspended for 2019. In December 2019, the HIF was repealed for calendar years after 2020.For additional informat
ion on the ACA fees, assessments and taxes, see Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. The Company’sgoal is to collect pre
miums and fees where possible, or solve for, all of the ACA-related fees, assessments and taxes.Health Care Benefits Seasonality
For periods prior to the Aetna Acquis
ition Date, the Health Care Benefits segment was comprised only of the Company’s SilverScript PDP business. The quarterlyearnings and operating cash 
flows of the PDP business are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of PDP membership.The Medicare Part D standard b
enefit design results in coverage that varies with a member’s cumulative annual out-of-pocket costs. The benefit design generallyresults in employers or oth
er entities that sponsor the Company’s products (“plan sponsors”) sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescriptiondrug costs in the early par
t of the year. As a result, the PDP pay percentage or benefit ratio generally decreases and operating income generally increases as the yearprogresses. For periods subsequent to th
e Aetna Acquisition, the Health Care Benefits segment’s quarterly operating income progression is also impacted by (i) theseasonality of benefit 
costs which generally increase during the year as Insured members progress through their annual deductibles and out-of-pocket expenselimits and (ii) the s
easonality of operating expenses, which are generally the highest during the fourth quarter due primarily to spending to support readiness for thestart of the upcoming plan y
ear and marketing associated with Medicare annual enrollment.During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2020, the quarterly earnings progression was also impacted by COVID-19. Beginning in mid-March, the health care systemexperienced a significant red
uction in utilization that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures. Utilization remained below historicallevels through April, began to r
ecover in May and June and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters, with select geographies impacted byCOVID-19 waves. The impact of the defer
ral of non-essential care was partially offset by COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, as well as planned COVID-19related investments.
Health Care Benefits Competition
The health care benefits in
dustry is highly competitive, primarily due to a large number of for-profit and not-for-profit competitors, competitors’ marketing andpricing and a prolifer
ation of competing products, including new products that are continually being introduced into the marketplace. New entrants into themarketplace, as well 
as consolidation within the industry, have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment. In addition, the rapid paceof change as the industry evolv
es towards a consumer-focused retail marketplace, including Insurance Exchanges, and the increased use of technology to interactwith members, providers and cus
tomers, increase the risks the Company currently faces from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors comparedto prior periods.
The Company believes that the s
ignificant factors that distinguish competing health plans include the perceived overall quality (including accreditation status),quality of service, comp
rehensiveness of coverage, cost (including premium rates, provider discounts and member out-of-pocket costs), product design, financialstability and ratings, br
eadth and quality of provider networks, ability to offer different provider network options, providers available in such networks, andquality of member support 
and care management programs. The Company believes that it is competitive on each of these factors. The12

Company’s ability to increase the number of persons covered by its health plans or to increase Health Care Benefits segment revenues is affected by its ability todifferentiate itself from its competitor
s on these factors. Competition may also affect the availability of services from providers, including primary carephysicians, specialists and hosp
itals.Insured products compete with 
local and regional health care benefits plans, health care benefits and other plans sponsored by other large commercial health carebenefit insurance comp
anies, health system owned health plans, new entrants into the marketplace and numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizationsoperating under licenses 
from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The largest competitor in Medicare products is Original Medicare. Additional HealthCare Benefits segment comp
etitors include other types of medical and dental provider organizations, various specialty service providers (including PBM servicesproviders), health car
e consultants, financial services companies, integrated health care delivery organizations (networks of providers who also coordinateadministrative serv
ices for and assume insurance risk of their members), third party administrators (“TPAs”), HIT companies and, for certain plans, programssponsored by the federal or st
ate governments. Emerging competitors include start up health care benefits plans, technology companies, provider-owned healthplans, new joint 
ventures (including not-for-profit joint ventures among firms from multiple industries), technology firms, financial services firms that aredistributing competing produ
cts on their proprietary Private Exchanges, and consulting firms that are distributing competing products on their proprietary PrivateExchanges, as well as non-tradi
tional distributors such as retail companies. The Company’s ability to increase the number of persons enrolled in InsuredCommercial Medical p
roducts also is affected by the desire and ability of employers to self-fund their health coverage.The Health Care Benefits segm
ent’s ASC plans compete primarily with other large commercial health care benefit companies, numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations ope
rating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and TPAs.The Health Care Benefits segm
ent’s international products compete with local, global and U.S.-based health plans and commercial health care benefit insurancecompanies, many of whom are l
icensed in more geographies and have a longer operating history, better brand recognition and greater marketplace presence inone or more geographies.
The provider solutions and HIT mark
etplaces and products are evolving rapidly. The Company competes for provider solutions and HIT business with other largehealth plans and commercial 
health care benefit insurance companies as well as information technology companies and companies that specialize in providersolutions and HIT. Many information 
technology product competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition, greater marketplace presence andmore experience in dev
eloping innovative products.In addition to competit
ive pressures affecting the Company’s ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, the Health Care Benefits segment’smedical membership h
as been and may continue to be adversely affected by adverse and/or uncertain economic conditions and reductions in workforce by existingcustomers due to adverse and
/or uncertain general economic conditions, especially in the United States and industries where such membership is concentrated.Health Care Benefits Reinsurance
The Company
  currently has several reinsurance agreements with non-affiliated insurers that relate to Health Care Benefits insurance policies. The Companyentered into these cont
racts to reduce the risk of catastrophic losses which in turn reduces capital and surplus requirements. The Company frequently evaluatesreinsurance opportunities
 and refines its reinsurance and risk management strategies on a regular basis.Corporate/Other Segment
The Company presents the rema
inder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•
Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and thecorporate relations, 
legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’sinvestments in its transf
ormation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; and•
Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.13

Business StrategyCVS Health is a different kind of he
alth care company. As a diversified health services company, CVS Health is focused on its purpose of helping people on theirpath to better health. 
In an increasingly connected and digital world, the Company is meeting people wherever they are and changing health care to meet theirneeds. Built on a foundation of unma
tched community presence, our diversified model engages one in three Americans each year. This broad reach differentiatesCVS Health and fosters an increased 
level of engagement with customers across the country. Through our innovative new products and services that help managechronic conditions, our HealthHUB car
e destinations, and our digital solutions, we are making health care more accessible, more affordable and simply better. TheCompany believes its strat
egy oriented around the consumer and being present for all the meaningful moments in health will drive long-term sustainable value andplace the Company at the fo
refront of the evolution of health care.Generic Sourcing Venture
The Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. 
(“Cardinal”) each have a 50% ownership in Red Oak Sourcing, LLC (“Red Oak”), a generic pharmaceutical sourcingentity. Under this arrange
ment, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiategeneric pharmaceut
ical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak. Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company.Working Capital Practices
The Company funds the growth of its businesses 
through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, proceedsfrom sale-leaseba
ck transactions and long-term borrowings. For additional information on the Company’s working capital practices, see “Liquidity and CapitalResources” in the MD&A included in I
tem 7 of this 10-K. The majority of the Retail/LTC segment non-pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or creditcards. Managed care orga
nizations, pharmacy benefit managers, government funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third party insuranceprograms, which represent th
e vast majority of the Company’s consolidated pharmacy revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. The remainder of theCompany’s consolidated pharma
cy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards. Employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourlyworkers, health plans, providers, gov
ernmental units, government-sponsored plans (with the exception of Medicare Part D services, which are described below),labor groups and expatriat
es, which represent the vast majority of Health Care Benefits segment revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. As a provider ofMedicare Part D services, 
the Company contracts annually with CMS. Utilization of services each plan year results in the accumulation of either a receivable fromor a payable to CMS. The timing of se
ttlement of the receivable or payable with CMS takes several quarters, which impacts working capital from year to year.Human Capital
Overview
At CVS Health, we share a single, clear pu
rpose: helping people on their path to better health. We devote significant time and attention to the attraction,development and retent
ion of colleagues to deliver high levels of service to our customers. Our commitment to them includes a competitive rewards package andprograms that support our dive
rse range of colleagues in rewarding and fulfilling careers. As of December 31, 2020, we employed nearly 300,000 colleaguesprimarily in the United St
ates including in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, approximately 71% of whom were full-time.We believe engaged col
leagues produce stronger business results and are more likely to build a career with the Company. Each year we conduct an internalengagement survey that prov
ides colleagues with an opportunity to share their opinions and experiences with respect to their role, their team and the enterprise tohelp our Board of Directors (th
e “Board”) and our management identify areas where we can improve colleague experience. The survey covers a broad range oftopics including developmen
t and opportunities, diversity management, recognition, performance, well-being, compliance and continuous improvement. In 2020,greater than 80% of our co
lleagues participated in the engagement survey, of which greater than 80% responded that they were actively engaged.The Board and our chief execut
ive officer (“CEO”) provide oversight of our human capital strategy, which consists of the following categories: total rewards;diversity, equity and inclus
ion; colleague development; and health and safety.14

Total RewardsWe recognize how vital our 
colleagues are to our success and strive to offer comprehensive and competitive wages and benefits to meet the varying needs of ourcolleagues and their f
amilies. The benefits and programs include annual bonuses, 401(k) plans, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, health care andinsurance benefits, paid 
time off, flexible work schedules, family leave, dependent care resources, colleague assistance programs and tuition assistance, amongmany others, depending on eligib
ility.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provid
ed enhanced pay and benefits, including bonuses to frontline colleagues, dependent care financial assistance,paid sick leave for par
t-time colleagues and paid time off to colleagues who test positive or are quarantined due to exposure.Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We believe that a diverse 
workforce creates a healthier, stronger and more sustainable company. We aim to attract, retain and support a diverse workforce thatreflects the many cus
tomers, patients, members and communities we serve. Our Diversity Management Leadership Council, a cross-functional group of seniorleaders appointed by our CEO, works with our Stra
tegic Diversity Management leadership team to intentionally embed diversity across all facets of our business.For our efforts, we have been re
cognized as a DiversityInc Top 50 Company, named to Bloomberg’s 2019 Gender-Equality Index and earned a 100 percent scoreon the Disability Equality Ind
ex, meaning the company is recognized as a “Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion.” The Company discloses information onour diversity, equity and inc
lusion strategy, programs and progress in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) Report.As a foundation of equity, we continuously 
focus on increasing underrepresented populations across our business. In 2020, 70% of our total colleague populationand 52% of our colleagues at 
the manager level and above self-reported as female. In addition, in 2020 our colleagues reported their race/ethnicity as: White (53%),Black/African American 
(16%), Hispanic/Latino (15%), Asian (11%) and Other (5%). The appendix to our CSR Report includes additional data on the diversity ofour workforce.
Our diversity management
 strategy emphasizes workplace representation, inclusion and belonging, talent acquisition and management and a diverse marketplace.We support 15 Colleague Resource Groups (
“CRGs”) that include more than 22,000 colleagues across the enterprise. These groups represent a wide range ofprofessional, cultural, 
ethical and personal affinities and interests, as well as formal mentoring programs. Our CRGs provide our colleagues with an opportunity toconnect and network with one anothe
r through a particular affinity, culture or interest. Each of our CRGs is sponsored by a senior leader.Colleague Development
The Company offers a number of r
esources and programs that attract, engage, develop, advance and retain colleagues. Training and development providescolleagues the support they n
eed to perform well in their current role while planning and preparing for future roles. We offer an online orientation program thatpairs new hires with seasoned col
leagues and the training continues throughout a colleague’s career through in-person, virtual and self-paced learning at all levels.We also provide mentoring, 
tools and workshops for colleagues to manage their career development. We offer a variety of management and leadership programsthat develop incumbent div
erse and other high potential colleagues. Our broad training practices include updated, tech-enabled tools and keep our colleaguesinformed of new developments 
in our industry that are relevant to their roles. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our colleagues completed nearly12 million training cours
es.Our colleague development p
rogram also promotes the importance of compliance across our business. Our colleagues demonstrate this commitment through ourannual Code of Conduct training, which 100% o
f active colleagues completed in 2020. In 2020, we launched more than 75 different training courses as part of ourannual Enterprise Complian
ce Training Program.Health & Safety
We have a strong commit
ment to providing a safe working environment.We utilize Safety Serv
ice Plans to analyze data and concentrate on key areas of risk to reduce the chance of workplace incidents. We focus on identifying causesand improving performanc
e when workplace incidents occur. We also engage leaders in promoting a culture of safety. With safety task forces in place at eachdistribution center, we e
mpower leaders and safety business partners to identify policies, procedures and processes that could improve their own operations.15

In addition, from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took a comprehensive approach to managing occupational health and safety challenges presented bythe pandemic. We impl
emented social distancing practices and enhanced cleaning protocols at all of our locations. We launched a COVID-19 command center tocoordinate responsive ac
tions to reports of COVID-positivity among colleagues, including contact tracing, sanitizing and collaborating with public health officials.We distributed personal p
rotective equipment based on our safety professionals’ assessment of various activities our colleagues perform. We added engineeringcontrols and enhanced safe
ty features in our retail locations, including protective panels at pharmacy counters and front store checkout stations. We developedtravel, work from home, sel
f-quarantine, wellness check, and other HR-related guidance to help colleagues maintain their health and safety while continuing tosupport the essential oper
ations of the Company.Intellectual Property
The Company has registered and/o
r applied to register a variety of trademarks and service marks used throughout its businesses, as well as domain names, andrelies on a combination o
f copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, in addition to contractual restrictions, to establish and protect the Company’sproprietary rights. The Company 
regards its intellectual property as having significant value in the Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefitssegments. The Company is not aware of 
any facts that could materially impact the continuing use of any of its intellectual property.Government Regulation
Overview
The Company’s operations are subj
ect to comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and comparable multiple levels of international regulation inthe jurisdictions in which i
t does business. There also continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by federal, state and international regulators of thehealth and related ben
efits industry’s business and reporting practices. In addition, many of the Company’s PBM clients and the Company’s payors in theRetail/LTC segment, including 
insurers, Medicare plans, Managed Medicaid plans and MCOs, are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the designand implementation of p
rescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor. Similarly, the Company’s LTC clients, such as skilled nursing facilities, are subject togovernment regulations, in
cluding many of the same government regulations to which the Company is subject.The laws and rules governing the Company
’s businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year andare subject to frequen
t change. The application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of the Company’s businesses createsareas of uncertainty. Fur
ther, there are numerous proposed health care, financial services and other laws and regulations at the federal, state and international levels,some of which could adversely a
ffect the Company’s businesses if they are enacted. The Company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or statelegislation or court pro
ceedings, including fundamental changes to the dynamics of one or more of the industries in which it competes, such as the federal or one ormore state governments fu
ndamentally restructuring the Commercial, Medicare or Medicaid marketplace or reducing payments to the Company under or financingfor Medicare, Medica
id, dual eligible or special needs programs, increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing, purchasing, and/or importation orchanging the laws governing PBMs, will change v
arious aspects of the industries in which it competes or the health care industry generally or the impact thosechanges will have on the Company’s busin
esses, operating results, cash flows and/or stock price, but the effects could be materially adverse. The Company hasinternal control poli
cies and procedures and conducts training and compliance programs for its employees to deter prohibited practices. However, if the Company’semployees or agents fai
l to comply with applicable laws governing its international or other operations, it may face investigations, prosecutions and other legalproceedings and action
s which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any failure or alleged failure to comply withapplicable laws and regul
ations summarized below, or any adverse applications or interpretations of, or changes in, the laws and regulations affecting the Companyand/or its businesses, could have 
a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition, cash flows and/or stock price. See Item 3 of this10-K, “Legal Proceedings,” for fu
rther information.The Company can give no assurance th
at its businesses, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected, or that theCompany will not be required to m
aterially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) theinterpretation or app
lication of existing laws or regulations, including the laws and regulations described in this Government Regulation section, as they may relateto one or more of the Company’s busin
esses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iii) pendingor future federal or s
tate governmental investigations of one or more of the Company’s16

businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iv) pending or future government audits,investigations or enforc
ement actions against the Company; (v) adverse developments in any pending qui tam  lawsuit against the Company, whethe r sealed orunsealed, or in any future 
qui tam  lawsuit that may be fil ed against the Company; or (vi) adverse developments in pending or future legal proceedings against theCompany or affecting one or mo
re of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally.Laws and Regulations Related to COVID-19
The Families First Coronavirus Response Ac
t (the “Families First Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) wereenacted in March 2020. Each of 
the Families First Act and the CARES Act requires the Company to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, inmany cases without member 
cost-sharing, in its Insured Health Care Benefits products.The CARES Act also provides relief funding to p
roviders to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing, preparing for and/orresponding to COVID-19 (provided no other source 
is obligated to reimburse those expenses) or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to COVID-19. Under the CARES Act, the Company receives rei
mbursement for uninsured patients in connection with COVID-19 testing and vaccination as well asmonoclonal antibody trea
tment. Aside from such reimbursement, the Company did not request any funding under the CARES Act. However, in the second quarterof 2020, the Company received $43 mi
llion from the CARES Act provider relief fund, all of which was returned to the U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices (“HHS”) during the second qua
rter of 2020.The CARES Act also allows for the deferra
l of the payment of the employer share of Social Security taxes effective March 27, 2020. The Company has elected todefer its Social Securi
ty tax payments in accordance with this provision, and will remit the associated payments in two equal installments on or about December31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, as required und
er the CARES Act. The Company deferred approximately $670 million of its Social Security tax payments duringthe year ended December 31, 2020.
In addition to the Famili
es First Act and the CARES Act, the Company is experiencing an unprecedented level of new laws, regulations, directives and orders fromfederal, state, county 
and municipal authorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of which have been issued on an emergency basis with immediate, or insome instances retroa
ctive, effect. These governmental actions include, but are not limited to, requirements to waive member cost-sharing associated with COVID-19 testing and treatmen
t, provide coverage for additional COVID-19-related services, expand the use of telemedicine, suspend precertification or other UMmechanisms (including r
eview of claims for medical necessity), allow earlier or longer renewal of prescriptions, extend grace periods for payments of premiums orlimit coverage termination based
 on non-payment of premiums or fees, modify health benefits coverage eligibility rules to help maintain employee eligibility, andfacilitate, ac
celerate or advance payments to providers. For example, in December 2020, as part of a COVID-19 relief package, Congress enacted a 3.75% paymentincrease to providers th
rough the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, which Medicare Advantage plans often use as a benchmark for provider contracts. As a result,in many instances the Company wil
l be contractually required to pass on this payment to its providers, which was not anticipated at the time of bidding.Related governmental a
ctions have required the Company to close or significantly limit operations at traditional office worksites and affected the hours ofoperation of MinuteClinic 
locations and the Company’s pharmacies. In some instances, the Company has taken permitted proactive actions consistent with moregeneral regulatory di
rectives, such as expanding home delivery of prescription medications, extending hours of operation for member assistance lines andliberalizing certain other terms of
 coverage. Similar directives have affected the Company’s international operations. The Company anticipates additional mandatesand directives from dom
estic and foreign federal, state, county and local authorities throughout the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some timethereafter, some of whi
ch may result in permanent changes in the Company’s operations or the health care and other benefits cost and other risks assumed by theCompany. Further, although the Company has se
en regulators relax certain requirements in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as temporary suspension ofcertain audits and extensi
ons of certain filing deadlines, failure to provide regulatory relief or accommodations in other areas may result in increased costs orreduced revenue for the Comp
any.The impact of this governm
ental activity on the U.S. economy, consumer, customer and health care provider behavior and health care utilization patterns is beyondour knowledge and control. As a result, 
the financial and/or operational impact these COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on ourbusinesses, operating results, 
cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the collective impact could be material and adverse.17

Laws and Regulations Related to Multiple Segments of the Company’s BusinessLaws Related to Reimbursement by Government Programs
 - The Company is subject to various federal and state laws concerning its submission of claims andother information to Medicare
, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs. Potential sanctions for violating these lawsinclude recoupment or red
uction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Such laws includ
e the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), the federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”), state false claims acts andanti-kickback statut
es in most states, the federal “Stark Law” and related state laws. In particular, the False Claims Act prohibits intentionally submitting,conspiring to submit, or causing 
to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, inconnection with reimburse
ment by federal government programs. In addition, any claim for government reimbursement also violates the False Claims Act where itresults from a violat
ion of the AKS.Both federal and state fal
se claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam  or “whistleblower” lawsuits on beh alf of the federal or state government.Participants in the hea
lth and related benefits industry, including the Company, frequently are subject to actions under the False Claims Act or similar state laws.The federal Stark Law
 generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient prescriptiondrugs, to any entity with which the physi
cian, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further prohibits theentity receiving a prohibite
d referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral.Various states have enact
ed similar laws.The ACA
 - The United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the ACA by June 2021. If the ACA is deemed unconstitutional, therewill likely be signific
ant changes to the laws and rules that govern the Company’s businesses. If the ACA is deemed constitutional, there may nevertheless becontinued efforts to inva
lidate, modify, repeal or replace it or portions of it, and the Company expects aspects of the ACA to continue to significantly impact itsbusiness operations and operat
ing results, including pricing, medical benefit ratios (“MBRs”) and the geographies in which the Company’s products are available.The ACA made broad-based changes to the U.S. hea
lth care system. While most of the significant aspects of the ACA became effective during or prior to 2014,parts of the ACA continue to evolve th
rough the promulgation of executive orders, legislation, regulations and guidance as well as ongoing litigation. Additionalchanges to the ACA and those regulations 
and guidance at the federal and/or state level are likely, and those changes are likely to be significant. Growing federaland state budgetary pressur
es make it more likely that any changes, including changes at the state level in response to changes to, or invalidation, repeal orreplacement of, the ACA and/or 
changes in the funding levels and/or payment mechanisms of federally supported benefit programs, will be adverse to us. Forexample, if any elem
ents of the ACA are invalidated or repealed at the federal level, the Company expects that some states would seek to enact similarrequirements, such as prohib
iting pre-existing condition exclusions, prohibiting rescission of insurance coverage, requiring coverage for dependents up to age 26,requiring guaranteed rene
wability of insurance coverage and prohibiting lifetime limits on insurance coverage.The Company filed a lawsuit in August 2019 to 
recover the $313 million it was owed under the ACA’s risk corridor program, which had been stayed pending theSupreme Court decision. In April 2020, th
e U.S. Supreme Court ruled that health insurance companies may sue the federal government for amounts owed ascalculated under the ACA’s te
mporary risk corridor program. In October 2020, the Company received the $313 million in funds it was owed under the ACA’s riskcorridor program.
The expansion of health car
e coverage contemplated by the ACA is being funded in part by reductions to the reimbursements the Company and other health plansare paid by the federa
l government for Medicare members, among other sources. While not all-inclusive, the following are some of the recent key funding changesrelated to the ACA (assuming it 
continues to be implemented in its current form). The Company continues to evaluate these provisions and the related regulationsand regulatory guidance to d
etermine the impact that they will have on its business operations and operating results:•
The repeal of the annual non-tax deductible industry-wide HIF for calendar years after 2020. The HIF was $15.5 billion and $14.3 billion for 2020 and 2018,respectively, and suspended fo
r 2019.•
The repeal of the non-tax deductible 40% excise tax on employer-sponsored health care benefits above a certain threshold that was scheduled to begin in 2022.•
Reduced federal matching funds for Medicaid expansion. Starting in 2017, the federal matching rate declined slightly each year until it reached 90 percent in2020, and will remain there.
18

The ACA also specifies minimum medical loss ratios (“MLRs”) for Commercial and Medicare Insured products, specifies features required to be included incommercial benefit designs, limit
s commercial individual and small group rating and pricing practices, encourages additional competition (including potentialincentives for new parti
cipants to enter the marketplace) and significantly increases federal and state oversight of health plans, including regulations and processesthat could delay or lim
it the Company’s ability to appropriately increase its health plan premium rates. This in turn could adversely affect the Company’s ability tocontinue to participa
te in certain product lines and/or geographies that it serves today.Potential repeal of th
e ACA, ongoing legislative, regulatory and administrative policy changes to the ACA, the results of federal and state level elections, pendinglitigation challeng
ing the constitutionality of the ACA or funding for the law and federal budget negotiations continue to create uncertainty about the ultimateimpact of the ACA. Given the inheren
t difficulty of foreseeing the nature and scope of future changes to the ACA and how states, businesses and individuals willrespond to those changes, the Company c
annot predict the impact on it of future changes to the ACA. It is reasonably possible that invalidation, repeal orreplacement of or oth
er changes to the ACA and/or states’ responses to such changes, in the aggregate, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’sbusinesses, operating results 
and cash flows.Medicare Regulation - 
The Company’s Medicare Advantage p roducts compete directly with Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage products offered byother Medicare Advantage o
rganizations and Medicare Supplement products offered by other insurers. The Company’s Medicare PDP and Medicare Supplementproducts are products that M
edicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in Original Medicare purchase to enhance their Original Medicare coverage.The Company continues to expand the numb
er of counties in which it offers Medicare products. The Company has expanded its Medicare service area andproducts in 2021 and is seeking to substan
tially grow its Medicare membership, revenue and operating results over the next several years, including through growthin Medicare Supplement 
products. The anticipated organic expansion of the Medicare service area and Medicare products offered and the Medicare-relatedprovisions of the ACA significantly in
crease the Company’s exposure to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/orfunding or regulation of, the v
arious Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programsand/or new reforms or surcha
rges on existing programs. For example, the ACA requires minimum MLRs for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans of85%. If a Medicare Advantag
e or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to enroll newmembers. If a Medica
re Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. Due to potential lowerutilization of medical services 
by Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible certain Medicare Advantage contracts may not meet the85% MLR for consecutive years.
The Company’s Medicare Advantage 
and PDP products are heavily regulated by CMS. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Companyand other private part
icipants in Medicare programs are complex, expensive to comply with and subject to change. For example, in the second quarter of 2014,CMS issued a final rule imple
menting the ACA requirements that Medicare Advantage and PDP plans report and refund to CMS overpayments that those plansreceive from CMS. The precis
e interpretation, impact and legality of this rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation. Payments the Company receivesfrom CMS for its Medicare Advant
age and Part D businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals enrolled. Elements ofthat risk adjustment m
echanism continue to be challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the“OIG”) and CMS itself. Substantial ch
anges in the risk adjustment mechanism, including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions, could materiallyaffect the amount of the 
Company’s Medicare reimbursement, require the Company to raise prices or reduce the benefits offered to Medicare beneficiaries, andpotentially limit 
the Company’s (and the industry’s) participation in the Medicare program.The Company has invested signific
ant resources to comply with Medicare standards, and its Medicare compliance efforts will continue to require significantresources. CMS may seek premium 
and other refunds, prohibit the Company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in or refuse to passively enrollmembers in one or more of 
the Company’s Medicare or Medicare-Medicaid demonstration (historically known as “dual eligible”) plans, exclude us fromparticipating in one or m
ore Medicare, dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs and/or institute other sanctions and/or civil monetary penaltiesagainst the Company if it f
ails to comply with CMS regulations or its Medicare contractual requirements. The Company’s Medicare Supplement products areregulated at the state level an
d subject to similar significant compliance requirements and risks.CMS regularly audits the Company’s pe
rformance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and to assess the quality ofservices it provides to Med
icare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries. For example, CMS conducts risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”) audits of a subset ofMedicare Advantage contract
s for each contract year.19

Since 2013, CMS has selected certain of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contracts for various years for RADV audit, and the number of RADV auditscontinues to increase. The OIG a
lso is auditing the Company’s risk adjustment data and that of other companies, and the Company expects CMS and the OIG tocontinue auditing risk adjus
tment data. The Company also has received Civil Investigative Demands (“CIDs”) from, and provided documents and information to,the Civil Division of the DOJ in connect
ion with a current investigation of its patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissionsunder Parts C and D of the Medicare p
rogram.On October 26, 2018, CMS issued proposed rules relat
ed to, among other things, changes to the RADV audit methodology established by CMS in 2012. CMSprojects that the chang
es to the RADV audit methodology would increase its recoveries from Medicare Advantage plans as a result of RADV audits. CMS hasrequested comments on the p
roposed rules, including whether the proposed RADV rule change should apply retroactively to audits of Medicare Advantage plansfor contract year 2011 and 
forward. The Company is evaluating the potential adverse effect, which could be material, on the Company’s operating results, financialcondition, and cash flows if the p
roposed RADV rule change were adopted as proposed. CMS also has announced that its goal is to subject all Medicare Advantagecontracts to either 
a comprehensive or a targeted RADV audit for each contract year.A portion of each Medicare Advan
tage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings.” The star rating system considers a variety of measures adopted byCMS, including quality of preventa
tive services, chronic illness management, compliance and overall customer satisfaction. Only Medicare Advantage plans withan overall star rat
ing of four or more stars (out of five stars) are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. As a result, the Company’s MedicareAdvantage plans’ operating r
esults in 2021 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings. The Company’s star ratings and past performancescores are adversely a
ffected by the compliance issues that arise each year in its Medicare operations. CMS released the Company’s 2021 star ratings in October2020. The Company’s 2021 star ratings will b
e used to determine which of its Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonuspayments in 2022. Based on the Company’s me
mbership at December 31, 2020, 83% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2021star ratings of at le
ast 4.0 stars. CMS also gives PDPs star ratings which affect each PDP’s enrollment. Medicare Advantage and PDP plans that are rated less thanthree stars for thre
e consecutive years are subject to contract termination by CMS. CMS continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve fourstars or more. Despite the Comp
any’s success in achieving high 2021 star ratings and other quality measures and the continuation of its improvement efforts, therecan be no assurances that i
t will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years. Accordingly, the Company’s Medicare Advantage plansmay not be eligible for 
full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership and/or reduce profit margins.Overall, the Company projects 
the benchmark payment rates in CMS’s April 2020 final notice detailing final Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates for2021 will increase funding for 
the Company’s Medicare Advantage business, excluding the impact of the HIF in 2020, by approximately 1.8% in 2021 compared to2020. This 2021 rate increase only p
artially offsets the challenge the Company faces from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care (including prescriptionmedications) and CMS local and n
ational coverage decisions that require the Company to pay for services and supplies that are not factored into the Company’sbids. The federal governmen
t may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for Medicare Advantage and/or PDPplans, or otherwise
 restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits, negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability ofproducts. The Company currently be
lieves that the payments it has received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the Company’s continuedparticipation in the M
edicare Advantage and PDP programs, although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the program,and this outlook could change. In Janu
ary 2021, CMS issued its final notice detailing final 2022 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates. Final 2022Medicare Advantage rat
es resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%.Going forward, the Company expects CMS, the OIG, the DOJ, other 
federal agencies and the U.S. Congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component ofthe Medicare program 
(including Medicare Advantage, PDPs, demonstration projects such as Medicare-Medicaid plans and provider network access andadequacy), modify the te
rms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers’ roles. It is not possible to predict the outcome ofthis Congressional or regulato
ry activity, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company.In addition, in November 2020, the HHS rele
ased the final Rebate Rule (the “Rebate Rule”), which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution underthe AKS for rebates from pharm
aceutical companies to PBMs in Medicare Part D, replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefitpatients with high out-of-pock
et costs and to change the way PBMs are compensated. The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to the patient atthe point of sale and (ii
) for flat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. The Pharmaceutical Care20

Management Association (the “PCMA”), which represents PBMs, has filed a suit in an effort to block the Rebate Rule, claiming that the Rebate Rule would lead tohigher premiums in Medic
are Part D and was adopted in an unlawful manner. It is unclear whether the Rebate Rule will be enforceable, whether pharmaceuticalcompanies will respond by reduc
ing list prices, whether list prices in the private market may also be reduced, and what the resulting impact will be to PBMs or theCompany.
340B Drug Pricing Program
 – The 340B Drug Pricing Program allows eligib le covered entities to purchase prescription drugs from manufacturers at a steepdiscount, and is overseen by the HHS and the Hea
lth Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”). In 2020, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers beganprograms that limit
ed covered entities’ participation in the program through contract pharmacies arrangements, which the Company has with some covered entities.Enforcement from HHS and HRSA to curb these manu
facturer practices will significantly impact the Company’s participation in the program in the future.Anti-Remuneration Laws
 - Federal law prohibits, among o ther things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject tocertain exceptions and 
“safe harbors,” any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which paymentmay be made under Medica
re, Medicaid or certain other federal and state health care programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which are notlimited to services p
aid for with government funds. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment, criminal andcivil fines, and exclusion 
from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs. Companies involved inpublic health care programs
 such as Medicare and/or Medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud, waste and abuse, and areoften the subject of fr
aud, waste and abuse investigations and audits. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with Medicare and Medicaidprogram standards. Ongoing vigorous law en
forcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that the Company’s compliance efforts in this area willcontinue to require signi
ficant resources.Antitrust and Unfair Competition 
- The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) investigates and prosecutes practices that are “unfair trade practices” or “unfairmethods of competition.” Num
erous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States against pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies and/or PBMsunder various federal and s
tate antitrust and unfair competition laws challenging, among other things: (i) brand name drug pricing and rebate practices ofpharmaceutical m
anufacturers, (ii) the maintenance of retail or specialty pharmacy networks by PBMs, and (iii) various other business practices of PBMs and retailpharmacies. To the exten
t that the Company appears to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or CVS Pharmacy, CVS Specialty orMinuteClinic plays a unique or 
expanded role in a Pharmacy Services or Health Care Benefits segment product offering, the Company’s business arrangements anduses of confidential inf
ormation may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anti-competitive perspective and possible challenge by state and/or federalregulators and/or priva
te parties.Privacy and Confidentiality Requirements
 - Many of the Company’s activi ties involve the receipt, use and disclosure by the Company of personally identifiableinformation (“PII”) 
as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws, which require organizations to provide appropriateprivacy and security saf
eguards for such information. In addition to PII, the Company uses and discloses de-identified data for analytical and other purposes whenpermitted. Additionally, 
there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which are a set ofrequirements designed to
 help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. Certain states haveincorporated these requ
irements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use and/or disclosure of PII.The federal Health Insur
ance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”), as further modified by theAmerican Recovery and Reinvest
ment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, providers, health careclearinghouses (known as “cover
ed entities”) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information (“PHI”). Further, ARRArequires the Company and other 
covered entities to report any breaches of PHI to impacted individuals and to the HHS and to notify the media in any states where500 or more people are imp
acted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI. Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing tocomply with HIPAA standards. The Health Infor
mation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), enacted as part of ARRA,amended HIPAA to impose additional r
estrictions on third-party funded communications using PHI and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for PHI. TheHITECH Act also extended HIPAA privacy and security 
requirements and penalties directly to business associates. HHS has begun to audit health plans, providersand other parties to enfo
rce HIPAA compliance, including with respect to data security.In addition to HIPAA, state health pr
ivacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA, including laws that place strictercontrols on the release o
f information relating to specific diseases or conditions and21

requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI. States also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the FinancialModernization Act of 1999 (also known as 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”)) which generally require insurers, including health insurers, to providecustomers with notice reg
arding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosuresbefore the insurer shar
es such information with a non-affiliated third party. Like HIPAA, GLBA sets a “floor” standard, allowing states to adopt more stringentrequirements governing pr
ivacy protection. Complying with additional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the Companyhas made to comply with HIPAA and GLBA.
The Cybersecurity Informa
tion Sharing Act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and, among other things,directs HHS to develop a set of volunt
ary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry. In addition, states have begun to enact morecomprehensive privacy l
aws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access, deletion, protection or transparency, such as the California ConsumerPrivacy Act (“CCPA”). States also are s
tarting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity, such as the regulations issued bythe New York Department of Financia
l Services. Complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations, which may differ from state to state, requires significantresources. In addition, dif
fering approaches to state privacy and/or cyber-security regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adverselyaffect the Company’s abilit
y to standardize its products and services across state lines. Widely-reported large scale commercial data breaches in the United Statesand abroad increase the 
likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states. These legislative and regulatory developmentswill impact the design and op
eration of the Company’s businesses, its privacy and security strategy and its web-based and mobile assets.Finally, each Public Exchange is 
required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to PII, and to impose privacy and security standards that are atleast as protective o
f PII as those the Public Exchange has implemented for itself or non-Public Exchange entities, which include insurers offering plans throughthe Public Exchange and their d
esignated downstream entities, including PBMs and other business associates. These standards may differ from, and be morestringent than, HIPAA.
Consumer Protection Laws
 - The federal governmen t has many consumer protection laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Postal ServiceAct and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Mos
t states also have similar consumer protection laws and a growing number of states regulate subscription programs.In addition, the federa
l government and most states have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring places of public accommodation, health care services and othergoods and services to be access
ible to people with disabilities. These consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis forinvestigations, lawsuits and mu
ltistate settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs, and health care products and services,pricing accuracy, expired fr
ont store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchangeprograms, disclosures rel
ated to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities. As a result of theCompany’s direct-to-consum
er activities, including mobile and web-based solutions offered to members and to other consumers, the Company also is subject tofederal and state r
egulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations. For example, the CCPAbecame effectiv
e in 2020, and additional federal and state regulation of consumer privacy protection may be proposed or enacted in 2020. The Company expectsthese new laws and regulations to 
impact the design of its products and services and the management and operation of its businesses and to increase its compliancecosts.
Transparency in Coverage Rule
 - In October 2020, the HHS released a f inal rule requiring health insurers to disclose negotiated prices of drugs, medical services,supplies and other covered i
tems to the public. The rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclosecost-sharing informat
ion upon request, to a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, which, unless otherwise indicated, for the purpose of the final rules includes anauthorized represent
ative, and require plans and issuers to disclose in-network provider rates, historical out-of-network allowed amounts and the associated billedcharges, and negotiated r
ates for prescription drugs. Disclosure of data in a machine readable file is required beginning in January 2022, and insurers are requiredto have a consumer tool in pl
ace by January 2023. The public disclosure of insurer- or PBM-negotiated price concessions may result in drug manufacturerslowering discounts or rebates, 
resulting in higher drug costs for patients and impacting the ability of the Company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitiveproducts and services to consum
ers.Telemarketing and Other Outbound Contacts
 - Certain federal and s tate laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Telemarketing SalesRule, give the FTC, the Federal Communic
ations Commission and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to,telemarketing pra
ctices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws provide consumerswith a private right of a
ction. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions.22

Pharmacy and Professional Licensure and Regulation - The Company is subject to a var iety of intersecting federal and state statutes and regulations that governthe wholesale distribution o
f drugs; operation of retail, specialty, infusion, LTC and mail order pharmacies; licensure of facilities and professionals, includingpharmacists, technic
ians, nurses and other health care professionals; registration of facilities with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) andanalogous state agencies 
that regulate controlled substances; packaging, storing, shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals; repackaging of drug products; labeling,medication guides and othe
r consumer disclosures; interactions with prescribers and health care professionals; compounding of prescription medications;dispensing of controlled and non-
controlled substances; counseling of patients; transfers of prescriptions; advertisement of prescription products and pharmacyservices; security; 
inventory control; recordkeeping; reporting to Boards of Pharmacy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the U.S. ConsumerProduct Safety Commission, the DEA and rel
ated state agencies; and other elements of pharmacy practice. Pharmacies are highly regulated and have contact with awide variety of federa
l, state and local agencies with various powers to investigate, inspect, audit or solicit information, including Boards of Pharmacy andNursing, the DEA, the FDA, the DOJ, HHS and others. Many of these agencies hav
e broad enforcement powers, conduct audits on a regular basis, can imposesubstantial fines and 
penalties, and may revoke the license, registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional.State Insurance, HMO and Insurance Holding Company Regulation - 
A number of states regulat e affiliated groups of insurers and HMOs such as theCompany under holding company statut
es. These laws may, among other things, require prior regulatory approval of dividends and material intercompany transfersof assets and transactions b
etween the regulated companies and their affiliates, including their parent holding companies. The Company expects the states in whichits insurance and HMO subsidiaries 
are licensed to continue to expand their regulation of the corporate governance and internal control activities of its insurancecompanies and HMOs. Changes to state insur
ance, HMO and/or insurance holding company laws or regulations or changes to the interpretation of those laws orregulations, including due to 
regulators’ increasing concerns regarding insurance company and/or HMO solvency due, among other things, to past and expectedpayor insolvencies, could nega
tively affect the Company’s businesses in various ways, including through increases in solvency fund assessments, requirements thatthe Company hold greater lev
els of capital and/or delays in approving dividends from regulated subsidiaries.PBM offerings of prescription drug 
coverage under certain risk arrangements may be subject to laws and regulations in various states. Such laws may require thatthe party at risk becom
e licensed as an insurer, establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability. Laws that may apply in such cases include insurancelaws and laws governing MCOs and limited pr
epaid health service plans.The states of domicile o
f the Company’s regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companiesand HMOs based on the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners’ Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act (the “RBC Model Act”). These RBCrequirements are in
tended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and HMOs, taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’sinvestments and products. The RBC Model Act se
ts forth the formula for calculating RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks,insurance risks, interes
t rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual company’s business. In general, under these laws, an insurance company orHMO must submit a report of its RBC level 
to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year. At December 31,2020, the RBC level of each of the Company’s 
insurance and HMO subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action.For information regarding 
restrictions on certain payments of dividends or other distributions by the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries, seeNote 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’
’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The holding company laws for the st
ates of domicile of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurancecompany or HMO without prior regulato
ry approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security ofan insurance holding company (su
ch as the Company’s ultimate parent company, CVS Health) that controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such aholding company, if as a resul
t of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company. Control is generally defined as the direct or indirectpower to direct or cause th
e direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% ormore of the voting securi
ties of another person.Certain states have law
s that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company.These state laws vary, and viol
ation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.23

Government Agreements and Mandates - The Company and/or its various a ffiliates are subject to certain consent decrees, settlement and other agreements,corrective action plans and
 corporate integrity agreements with various federal, state and local authorities relating to such matters as privacy practices, controlledsubstances, PDPs, expired products, environm
ental and safety matters, marketing and advertising practices, PBM, LTC and other pharmacy operations and variousother business practices. Ce
rtain of these agreements contain ongoing reporting, monitoring and/or other compliance requirements for the Company. Failure tomeet the Company’s o
bligations under these agreements could result in civil or criminal remedies, financial penalties, administrative remedies, and/or exclusionfrom participation in federal healt
h care programs.Environmental and Safety Regulation
 - The Company’s businesses are subje ct to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirementspertaining to protect
ion of the environment, public health and employee safety, including, for example, regulations governing the management of hazardoussubstances, the cleaning up of 
contaminated sites, and the maintenance of safe working conditions in the Company’s retail locations, distribution centers and otherfacilities. Governmental agencie
s at the federal, state and local levels continue to focus on the retail and health care sectors’ compliance with such laws andregulations, and have at t
imes pursued enforcement activities. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by governmentauthorities.
ERISA Regulation 
- The Employee Retiremen t Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employeepension and benefit plans, inc
luding private employer and union sponsored health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide PBM services. Ingeneral, the Company assists pl
an sponsors in the administration of their health benefit plans, including the prescription drug benefit portion of those plans, inaccordance with the plan d
esigns adopted by the plan sponsors. In addition, the Company may have fiduciary duties where it has specifically contracted with a plansponsor to accept limit
ed fiduciary responsibility, such as for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims and/or the appeals of denied claims under aplan. In addition to its fidu
ciary provisions, ERISA imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certainforms of illegal re
muneration are made or received. These provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is oftenuncertain.
Some of the Company’s health and r
elated benefits and large case pensions products and services and related fees also are subject to potential issues raised byjudicial interpre
tations relating to ERISA. Under those interpretations, together with U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) regulations, the Company may haveERISA fiduciary duties with respec
t to PBM members and/or certain general account assets held under contracts that are not guaranteed benefit policies. As aresult, certain tr
ansactions related to those general account assets are subject to conflict of interest and other restrictions, and the Company must provide certaindisclosures to policyholders 
annually. The Company must comply with these restrictions or face substantial penalties.In addition, ERISA generally pree
mpts all state and local laws that relate to employee benefit plans, but the extent of the pre-emption continues to be reviewed bycourts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. For ex
ample, in December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Arkansas law that, among other things, mandates aparticular pricing 
methodology, establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is below the pharmacy’s acquisition cost, permits apharmacy to reverse and 
rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than the reimbursement rate, prohibits a PBM fromreimbursing a pharmacy 
less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis, and permits a pharmacy to decline to dispense if the reimbursement islower than the pharmacy’s 
acquisition cost.Other Legislative Initiativ
es and Regulatory Initiatives - The U.S. federal and state gove rnments, as well as governments in other countries where the Companydoes business, continue to enact 
and seriously consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that have had a material impact on or couldmaterially impa
ct various aspects of the health care and related benefits system and the Company’s businesses, operating results and/or cash flows. For example:•
Under the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 significant, automatic across-the-board budget cuts (known assequestration) began in Ma
rch 2013, including Medicare spending cuts of not more than 2% of total program costs per year through 2024. Since then,Congress has extended and modified s
equestration a number of times. Currently, the CARES Act suspended Medicare sequestration from May 2020 to the endof December 2020 and extended m
andatory sequestration to 2030. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 extended the temporary suspension ofMedicare sequestrat
ion through the end of March 2021. Significant uncertainty remains as to whether and how the U.S. Congress will proceed with actionsthat create additional federal reven
ue and/or with entitlement reform. The Company cannot predict future federal Medicare or federal or state Medicaidfunding levels or the impa
ct that future federal or state budget actions or entitlement program reform, if it occurs, will have on the Company’s businesses,operations or operating r
esults, but the effects could be materially adverse, particularly on the Company’s Medicare and/or Medicaid revenues, MBRs andoperating results.

•The European Union’s (“EU’s”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) began to apply across the EU during 2018.•
Other significant legislative and/or regulatory measures which are or recently have been under consideration include the following:•
Eliminating payment of manufacturer’s rebates on prescription drugs to PBMs, PDPs and Managed Medicaid organizations in connection withfederally funded heal
th care programs.•
Imposing requirements and restrictions on the design and/or administration of pharmacy benefit plans offered by the Company’s and its clients’health plans and/or its PBM cli
ents and/or the services the Company provides to those clients, including prohibiting “differential” or “spread” pricingin PBM contracts; restric
ting or eliminating the use of formularies for prescription drugs; restricting the Company’s ability to require members toobtain drugs through a home deliv
ery or specialty pharmacy; restricting the Company’s ability to place certain specialty or other drugs in the highercost tiers of its pharmacy
 formularies; restricting the Company’s ability to make changes to drug formularies and/or clinical programs; limiting oreliminating rebates on pharmace
uticals; requiring the use of up front purchase price discounts on pharmaceuticals in lieu of rebates; restricting theCompany’s ability to configur
e its health plan and retail pharmacy provider networks, including use of CVS Pharmacy locations; and restricting oreliminating the use of 
certain drug pricing methodologies.•
Increasing federal or state government regulation of, or involvement in, the pricing and/or purchasing of drugs.•
Restricting the Company’s ability to limit providers’ participation in its networks and/or remove providers from its networks by imposing networkadequacy requirements o
r otherwise (including in its Medicare and Commercial Health Care Benefits products).•
Imposing assessments on (or to be collected by) health plans or health carriers that may or may not be passed through to their customers. Theseassessments may include ass
essments for insolvency, the uninsured, uncompensated care, Medicaid funding or defraying health care providermedical malpractice insurance costs.
•
Mandating coverage by the Company’s and its clients’ health plans for additional conditions and/or specified procedures, drugs or devices (e.g., highcost pharmaceuticals, experimental
 pharmaceuticals and oral chemotherapy regimens).•
Regulating electronic connectivity.•
Mandating or regulating the disclosure of provider fee schedules, manufacturer’s rebates and other data about the Company’s payments to providersand/or payments the 
Company receives from pharmaceutical manufacturers.•
Mandating or regulating disclosure of provider outcome and/or efficiency information.•
Prescribing or limiting members’ financial responsibility for health care or other covered services they utilize, including restricting “surprise” bills byproviders and by specifying proc
edures for resolving “surprise” bills.•
Prescribing payment levels for health care and other covered services rendered to the Company’s members by providers who do not have contractswith the Company.
•
Assessing the medical device status of HIT products and/or solutions, mobile consumer wellness tools and clinical decision support tools, which mayrequire compliance wi
th FDA requirements in relation to some of these products, solutions and/or tools.•
Restricting the ability of employers and/or health plans to establish or impose member financial responsibility.•
Amending or supplementing ERISA to impose greater requirements on PBMs or the administration of employer-funded benefit plans or limit thescope of current ERISA pre-empt
ion, which would among other things expose the Company and other health plans to expanded liability for punitiveand other extra-contr
actual damages and additional state regulation.It is uncertain whether 
the Company can counter the potential adverse effects of such potential legislation or regulation on its operating results or cash flows,including whether it can r
ecoup, through higher premium rates, expanded membership or other measures, the increased costs of mandated coverage or benefits,assessments, fees, taxes or o
ther increased costs, including the cost of modifying its systems to implement any enacted legislation or regulations.The Company’s businesses also may be a
ffected by other legislation and regulations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act createsincentives for whistleblowe
rs to speak directly to the government rather than utilizing internal compliance programs and reduces the burden of proof under theForeign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 
(the “FCPA”). There also are laws and regulations that set standards for the escheatment of funds to states.Health savings accounts, heal
th reimbursement arrangements and flexible spending accounts and certain of the tax, fee and subsidy provisions of the ACA also areregulated by the U.S. Department o
f the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.25

The Company also may be adversely affected by court and regulatory decisions that expand or revise the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations orimpose medical malp
ractice or bad faith liability. Federal and state courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, continue to consider cases, and federal and stateregulators continue to issu
e regulations and interpretations, addressing bad faith liability for denial of medical claims, the scope of ERISA’s fiduciary dutyrequirements, the scope o
f the False Claims Act and the pre-emptive effect of ERISA on state laws.Contract Audits 
- The Company is subject to audits o f many of its contracts, including its PBM client contracts, its PBM rebate contracts, its PBM networkcontracts, its contra
cts relating to Medicare Advantage and/or Medicare Part D, the agreements the Company’s pharmacies enter into with other payors, itsMedicaid contracts and 
its customer contracts. Because some of the Company’s contracts are with state or federal governments or with entities contracted withstate or federal agencies, au
dits of these contracts are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefitsprograms, including those which ope
rate Medicaid fee for service plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare Part D plans or Medicare Advantage organizations.Federal Employee Health Benefits Prog
ram - The Company’s subsidiaries cont ract with the Office of Personnel Management (the “OPM”) to provide managedhealth care servic
es under the FEHB program in their service areas. These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium ratingarrangements for this p
rogram. OPM regulations require that community-rated FEHB plans meet a FEHB program-specific minimum MLR by plan code andmarket. Managing to these 
rules is complicated by the simultaneous application of the minimum MLR standards and associated premium rebate requirements ofthe ACA. The Company also has a contractua
l arrangement with carriers for the FEHB program, such as the BlueCross BlueShield Association, to providepharmacy services to f
ederal employees, postal workers, annuitants, and their dependents under the Government-wide Service Benefit Plan, as authorized by theFEHB Act and as part of the FEHB program. Additionally, 
the Company manages certain FEHB plans on a “cost-plus” basis. These arrangements subject theCompany to certain aspects o
f the FEHB Act, and other federal regulations, such as the FEHB Acquisition Regulation, that otherwise would not be applicable tothe Company. The OPM also is auditing the Company 
and its other contractors to, among other things, verify that plans meet their applicable FEHB program-specific MLR and the premiu
ms established under the OPM’s Insured contracts and costs allocated pursuant to the OPM’s cost-based contracts are in compliancewith the requirements of 
the applicable FEHB program. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against the Company if it fails to complywith the FEHB program requirements.
Clinical Services Regulation 
- The Company provides clinica l services to health plans, PBMs and providers for a variety of complex and common medicalconditions, includin
g arranging for certain members to participate in disease management programs. State laws regulate the practice of medicine, the practice ofpharmacy, the practi
ce of nursing and certain other clinical activities. Clinicians engaged in a professional practice in connection with the provision of clinicalservices must satisfy ap
plicable state licensing requirements and must act within their scope of practice.Third Party Administration and Other State Licensure Laws 
- Many states have licensu re or registration laws governing certain types of administrativeorganizations, such as PPOs, TPAs and companies tha
t provide utilization review services. Several states also have licensure or registration laws governing theorganizations that provid
e or administer consumer card programs (also known as cash card or discount card programs).International Regulation - 
The Company has insurance licens es in several foreign jurisdictions and does business directly or through local affiliations innumerous countries around the wor
ld. The Company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve customers in the European Economic Area following the UnitedKingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brex
it”). However, the impact of Brexit on the Company’s international business and operating results is uncertain.The Company’s international op
erations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely byjurisdiction, including an
ti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance,privacy, data protect
ion (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which began to apply across the EU during 2018), data mining, data transfer, laborand employment, intell
ectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; compulsory cessions ofreinsurance; required localization
 of records and funds; higher premium and income taxes; limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital; and requirements forlocal participat
ion in an insurer’s ownership. In addition, the expansion of the Company’s operations into foreign countries increases the Company’s exposure tothe anti-bribery, ant
i-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign laws, including the U.K.Bribery Act 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”).
26

Anti-Corruption Laws - The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain orretain business or otherwise s
ecure a business advantage. The Company also is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Inmany countries outside the Uni
ted States, health care professionals are employed by the government. Therefore, the Company’s dealings with them are subject toregulation under the FCPA. Violations of th
e FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, andthere continues to be a he
ightened level of FCPA enforcement activity by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the DOJ. The UKBribery Act is an anti-cor
ruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Disclosures ofFCPA violations may be shared with the UK authori
ties, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions.Anti-Money Laundering Regulations
 - Certain lines of the Company ’s businesses are subject to Treasury anti-money laundering regulations. Those lines ofbusiness have implemented 
anti-money laundering policies designed to ensure their compliance with the regulations. The Company also is subject to anti-moneylaundering laws in non-U.S. jurisdict
ions where it operates.Office of Foreign Assets Control
 - The Company also is subject to r egulation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury(“OFAC”). OFAC administers and enforces econom
ic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreigncountries and regimes, t
errorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and otherthreats to the nationa
l security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. In addition, the Company is subject to similar regulations in the non-U.S.jurisdictions in which it ope
rates.FDA Regulation - 
The FDA regulates the Company’s compounding pha rmacy and clinical research operations. The FDA also generally has authority to, amongother things, regulate th
e manufacture, distribution, sale and labeling of medical devices (including hemodialysis devices such as the device the Company isdeveloping and mobile medi
cal devices) and many products sold through retail pharmacies, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, cosmetics,dietary supplements and c
ertain food items. In addition, the FDA regulates the Company’s activities as a distributor of store brand products.Laws and Regulations Related to the Pharmacy Services Segment
In addition to the laws and regu
lations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state andlocal statutes and regu
lations governing the operation of its Pharmacy Services segment specifically. Among these are the following:PBM Laws and Regulation 
- Legislation and/or regu lations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in anumber of states. This legis
lation could adversely affect the Company’s ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in states where thelegislation is in eff
ect and the Company’s ability to standardize its PBM products and services across state lines. In addition, certain quasi-regulatory organizations,including the National Associa
tion of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and the National Council ofInsurance Legislators, hav
e issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBM activities. Similarly, credentialingorganizations such as NCQA and URAC may establish volunta
ry standards regarding PBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy activities. While theactions of these quasi-r
egulatory or standard-setting organizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements orrecommendations and inf
luence client requirements for PBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy services. Moreover, any standards established bythese organizations could 
also impact the Company’s health plan clients and/or the services provided to those clients and/or the Company’s health plans.The Company’s PBM activities also a
re regulated directly and indirectly at the federal and state levels, including being subject to the False Claims Act and statefalse claims acts 
and the AKS and state anti-kickback laws. These laws and regulations govern, and proposed legislation and regulations may govern and/or furtherrestrict, critical PBM practices
, including disclosure, receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers; use of,administration of and/o
r changes to drug formularies, maximum allowable cost (“MAC”) list pricing, average wholesale prices (“AWP”) and/or clinical programs;the offering to plan sponsors of p
ricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread” (i.e., a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsorby a PBM and the price paid by the PBM to the disp
ensing provider); disclosure of data to third parties; drug UM practices; the level of duty a PBM owes itscustomers; configurat
ion of pharmacy networks; the operations of the Company’s pharmacies (including audits of its pharmacies); disclosure of negotiatedprovider reimbursement rates; 
disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to members’ drugutilization; and reg
istration or licensing of PBMs. Failure by the27

Company or one of its PBM services suppliers to comply with these laws or regulations could result in material fines and/or sanctions and could have a materialadverse effect on the Comp
any’s operating results and/or cash flows.The Company’s PBM service contracts, 
including those in which the Company assumes certain risks under performance guarantees or similar arrangements, aregenerally not subject to 
insurance regulation by the states. However, state departments of insurance are increasing their oversight of PBM activities due tolegislation passing in a numb
er of states requiring PBMs to register or obtain a license with the department. Rulemaking is either underway or has already takenplace in a number of sta
tes with the areas of focus on licensure requirements, pharmacy reimbursement for generics (MAC reimbursement) and pharmacy audits -most of which fall under the s
tate insurance code.Most-Favored-Nations Rule
 - In November 2020, HHS released the Most-Favo red-Nations Rule (the “MFN Rule”), which requires CMS to take a most-favored-nation approach in calcu
lating payment for Medicare Part B drugs. The MFN Rule will test paying Part B drugs at comparable amounts to the lowest adjusted pricepaid by any country in the Organiz
ation for Economic Co-operation and Development that has a Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) per capita that is at least 60% ofthe U.S. GDP per capita. The MFN Rule will also test a 
redesign of the percentage add-on payment structure under Medicare Part B to remove incentives for use ofhigher-cost drugs through a fl
at per-dose add-on payment, and will include a financial hardship exemption for participants. The mandatory MFN Rule will operatefor seven years, from Janua
ry 1, 2021 to December 31, 2027. Over the course of the model, CMS will monitor and evaluate the impact of the MFN Rule onbeneficiary access 
to drugs, program costs, and the quality of care for beneficiaries. Further, CMS commits to assess initial impacts of the MFN Rule on quality ofcare, including access 
to drugs, prior to beginning performance year 5. Multiple pharmaceutical manufacturers have sued HHS over the rule, and it is currentlydelayed due to a tempora
ry restraining order prohibiting CMS from implementing it. If implemented, the MFN Rule may impact the ability of the Company tonegotiate drug prices and p
rovide competitive products and services to consumers.Pharmacy Network Access Legislation 
- Medicare Part D and a ma jority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s (and its healthplans’ and its health plan 
clients’) ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove pharmacy network providers. For example, certain “any willingprovider” legislation 
may require the Company or its clients to admit a nonparticipating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plan’s price andother applicable te
rms and conditions for network participation. These laws could negatively affect the services and economic benefits achievable through a limitedpharmacy provider network. Also, a 
majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the Company’s ability (and the Company’s and its client healthplans’ ability) to conduc
t audits of network pharmacies regarding claims submitted to the Company for payment. These laws could negatively affect theCompany’s ability to recove
r overpayments of claims submitted by network pharmacies that the Company identifies through pharmacy audits.Pharmacy Pricing Legislation
 - A number of states have passed legislation regulating the Company’s ability to manage and establish MACs for genericprescription drugs. MAC methodology is a 
common cost management practice used by private and public payors (including CMS) to pay pharmacies fordispensing generic prescr
iption drugs. MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that isavailable from mul
tiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies, thekinds of drugs that a PBM can pay for at 
a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could negativelyaffect the Company’s abi
lity to establish MAC prices for generic drugs.Formulary and Plan Design Regulation 
- A number of government enti ties regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. HHS regulates howMedicare Part D formula
ries are developed and administered, including requiring the inclusion of all drugs in certain classes and categories, subject to limitedexceptions. Under the ACA, CMS imposes drug coverage 
requirements for health plans required to cover essential health benefits, including plans offered throughfederal or state Publi
c Exchanges. Additionally, the NAIC and health care accreditation agencies like NCQA and URAC have developed model acts and standardsfor formulary developm
ent that are often incorporated into government requirements. Many states regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as thedelivery channels to re
ceive prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. The increasing government regulation of formularies couldsignificantly affe
ct the Company’s ability to develop and administer formularies, pharmacy networks and other plan design features on behalf of its insurer, MCOand other clients. Simil
arly, some states prohibit health plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive pharmacy benefit plan design features. This regulationcould limit or preclude (i) limite
d networks, (ii) a requirement to use particular providers, (iii) copayment differentials among providers and (iv) formulary tieringpractices.

Laws and Regulations Related to the Retail/LTC SegmentIn addition to the laws and regu
lations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state andlocal statutes and regu
lations governing the operation of its Retail/LTC segment specifically. Among these are the following:Retail Medical Clinics 
- States regulate re tail medical clinics operated by nurse practitioners or physician assistants through physician oversight, clinic and lablicensure requirem
ents and the prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine. A number of states have implemented or proposed laws or regulations that impactcertain components of r
etail medical clinic operations such as physician oversight, signage, third party contracting requirements, bathroom facilities, and scope ofservices. These laws and regul
ations may affect the operation and expansion of the Company’s owned and managed retail medical clinics.Other Laws - 
Other federal, state and local laws and regulations also impact the Company’s retail operations, including laws and regulations governing thepractice of optomet
ry, the practice of audiology, the provision of dietician services and the sale of durable medical equipment, contact lenses, eyeglasses, hearingaids and alcohol.
Laws and Regulations Related to the Health Care Benefits Segment
In addition to the laws and regu
lations discussed above that may affect multiple segments of the Company’s business, the Company is subject to federal, state, localand international sta
tutes and regulations governing its Health Care Benefits segment specifically.Overview
 - Differing approaches to s tate insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability tostandardize its Health Ca
re Benefits products and services across state lines. These laws and regulations, including the ACA, restrict how the Company conducts itsbusiness and result in addition
al burdens and costs to the Company. Significant areas of governmental regulation include premium rates and rating methodologies,underwriting rules and procedu
res, required benefits, sales and marketing activities, provider rates of payment, restrictions on health plans’ ability to limitproviders’ participa
tion in their networks and/or remove providers from their networks and financial condition (including reserves and minimum capital or riskbased capital requir
ements). These laws and regulations are different in each jurisdiction and vary from product to product.Each health insurer and HMO must f
ile periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs aresubject to state exam
ination and periodic license renewal. Applicable laws also restrict the ability of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends, andcertain dividends requi
re prior regulatory approval. In addition, some of the Company’s businesses and related activities may be subject to PPO, MCO, utilizationreview or TPA-related lic
ensure requirements and regulations. These licensure requirements and regulations differ from state to state, but may contain providernetwork, contracting, product 
and rate, financial and reporting requirements. There also are laws and regulations that set specific standards for the Company’sdelivery of services, pay
ment of claims, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, and payment for covered benefits and services.Required Regulatory Approvals
 - The Company must obtain and main tain regulatory approvals to price, market and administer many of its Health Care Benefitsproducts. Supervisory agencies, in
cluding CMS, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight and the DOL, as well as state health, insurance,managed care and Medic
aid agencies, have broad authority to take one or more of the following actions:•
Grant, suspend and revoke the Company’s licenses to transact business;•
Suspend or exclude the Company from participation in government programs;•
Suspend or limit the Company’s authority to market products;•
Regulate many aspects of the products and services the Company offers, including the pricing and underwriting of many of its products and services;•
Assess damages, fines and/or penalties;•
Terminate the Company’s contract with the government agency and/or withhold payments from the government agency to the Company;•
Impose retroactive adjustments to premiums and require the Company to pay refunds to the government, customers and/or members;•
Restrict the Company’s ability to conduct acquisitions or dispositions;29

•Require the Company to maintain minimum capital levels in its subsidiaries and monitor its solvency and reserve adequacy;•
Regulate the Company’s investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria; and/or•
Exclude the Company’s plans from participating in Public Exchanges if they are deemed to have a history of “unreasonable” premium rate increases or fail tomeet other criteria set by H
HS or the applicable state.The Company’s operations, curren
t and past business practices, current and past contracts, and accounts and other books and records are subject to routine, regularand special investigat
ions, audits, examinations and reviews by, and from time to time the Company receives subpoenas and other requests for information from,federal, state and international
 supervisory and enforcement agencies, attorneys general and other state, federal and international governmental authorities andlegislators.
Commercial Product Pricing and Underwriting Restri
ctions - Pricing and underwriting regu lation by states limits the Company’s underwriting and ratingpractices and those of oth
er health insurers, particularly for small employer groups, and varies by state. In general, these limitations apply to certain customersegments and limit the Comp
any’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups, or both, based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior claimexperience. In some sta
tes, these laws and regulations restrict the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs in theCompany’s pricing.
The ACA expanded the premium rate 
review process by, among other things, requiring the Company’s Commercial Insured rates to be reviewed for“reasonableness” at either the
 state or the federal level. HHS established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rateincreases equal to or ex
ceeding a federally (or lower state) specified threshold. HHS’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements aswell as additional revi
ew on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold. These combined state and federalreview requirements m
ay prevent, further delay or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes, which could adversely affect its MBRsand operating results,
 particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services and/or medical cost trend or when such utilization and/or trendexceeds the Company’s projec
tions.The ACA also specifies minimum MLRs of 85% 
for large group Commercial products and 80% for individual and small group Commercial products. Because theACA minimum MLRs are structured as “
floors” for many of their requirements, states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these restrictions.For Commercial products, sta
tes have and may adopt higher minimum MLR requirements, use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio,” incorporateminimum MLR requirements
 into prospective premium rate filings, require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related to minimumMLR. Minimum MLR requirements and si
milar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured Commercial products while leavingthe Company exposed to medical 
costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to significant fines, penalties, premiumrefunds and litigation i
f it fails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.In addition, the Company request
ed increases in its premium rates in its Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2020 (including as a result of thereinstatement of th
e HIF for 2020 following the temporary suspension of the HIF for 2019) and expects to continue to request increases in those rates for 2021 andbeyond in order to adequately p
rice for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significant assessments, fees and taxesimposed by the federal and s
tate governments, including as a result of the ACA. The Company’s rates also must be adequate to reflect adverse selection in itsproducts, particularly 
in small group Commercial products. These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adverse publicity, adverseregulatory action and adv
erse selection and the likelihood that the Company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied, reduced or delayed, which couldlead to operating marg
in compression.Many of the laws and regulations gov
erning the Company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and othercarriers may charg
e between new and renewal business, and/or between groups based on differing characteristics. They may also require that carriers disclose tocustomers the basis o
n which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’ coverage.Medicaid Regulation - 
The Company is seeking to substantia lly grow its Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the nextseveral years. As a result, 
the Company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the various Medicaid,dual eligible and dual e
ligible special needs plan programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to the Company underthose programs.
30

Since 2017, Managed Medicaid products, including those the Company offers, are subject to a minimum federal MLR of 85%. A Medicaid managed care qualityrating system and provider n
etwork adequacy requirements also apply to Medicaid products. Because the federal minimum MLR is structured as a “floor,” stateshave the latitude to en
act more stringent rules governing these restrictions. For Managed Medicaid products, states may adopt higher minimum MLR requirements,use more stringent defin
itions of “medical loss ratio” or impose other requirements related to minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actionsfurther limit the 
level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured Medicaid products while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher thanthose reflected in i
ts pricing. The Company also may be subject to significant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimumMLR laws and regulations.
The future of the ACA, and the impac
t of Medicaid expansion under the ACA, are uncertain. States may opt out of the elements of the ACA requiring expansion ofMedicaid coverage without 
losing their current federal Medicaid funding. To date, a number of states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaidcoverage to the higher e
ligibility levels contemplated by the ACA. In addition, the election of new governors and/or state legislatures may impact states’ previousdecisions regarding Medic
aid expansion. Proposals for substantial changes to federal funding of state Medicaid programs are likely to be considered in 2020 andbeyond, including the possibility o
f converting federal Medicaid support to block grants (such as the block grant option outlined by CMS on January 30, 2020) andper capita caps on fede
ral funding. Uncertainty regarding federal funding is causing and will continue to cause states to re-evaluate their Medicaid expansions andconsider new assessments, fees 
and/or taxes on health plans. That re-evaluation and any changes to federal funding of state Medicaid programs may adverselyaffect Medicaid pay
ment rates, the Company’s revenues and its Medicaid membership.The economic aspects of th
e Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan business vary from state to state and are subject to frequent change.Medicaid premiums ar
e paid by each state and differ from state to state. The federal government and certain states also are considering proposals and legislation forMedicaid and dual eligib
le program reforms or redesigns, including restrictions on the collection of manufacturer’s rebates on pharmaceuticals by Medicaid MCOsand their contracted PBMs, fur
ther program, population and/or geographic expansions of risk-based managed care, increasing beneficiary cost-sharing or paymentlevels, and changes to benef
its, reimbursement, eligibility criteria, provider network adequacy requirements (including requiring the inclusion of specified high costproviders in the Company’s networks) 
and program structure. In some states, current Medicaid and dual eligible funding and premium revenue may not beadequate for the Company to con
tinue program participation. The Company’s Medicaid and dual eligible contracts with states (or sponsors of Medicaid managedcare plans) are subje
ct to cancellation by the state (or the sponsors of the managed care plans) after a short notice period without cause (e.g., when a statediscontinues a managed ca
re program) or in the event of insufficient state funding.The Company’s Medicaid, dual el
igible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by CMS and state Medicaid agencies, which havethe right to audit the Company
’s performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations. The Company’s Medicaid products, dual eligibleproducts and CHIP contracts also ar
e subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state Medicaid agencies regarding the services provided toMedicaid enrollees, pay
ment for those services, network requirements (including mandatory inclusion of specified high-cost providers), and other aspects of theseprograms, and by external r
eview organizations which audit Medicaid plans on behalf of state Medicaid agencies. The laws, regulations and contractualrequirements applic
able to the Company and other participants in Medicaid and dual eligible programs, including requirements that the Company submit encounterdata to the applicabl
e state agency, are extensive, complex and subject to change. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards,and its Medicaid and dual e
ligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources. CMS and/or state Medicaid agencies may fine theCompany, withhold payments to the Company, se
ek premium and other refunds, terminate the Company’s existing contracts, elect not to award the Company newcontracts or not to renew th
e Company’s existing contracts, prohibit the Company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in or refuse to automaticallyassign members to one or mor
e of the Company’s Medicaid or dual eligible products, exclude the Company from participating in one or more Medicaid or dualeligible programs and/o
r institute other sanctions and/or civil monetary penalties against the Company if it fails to comply with CMS or state regulations orcontractual requirements.
The Company cannot predict whethe
r pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the Medicaid program, norcan it predict the i
mpact those changes will have on its business operations or operating results, but the effects could be materially adverse.Federal and State Reporting 
- The Company is subject to extens ive financial and business reporting requirements, including penalties for inaccuracies and/oromissions, at both the feder
al and state level. The Company’s ability to comply with certain of these requirements depends on receipt of information from thirdparties that may not be 
readily available or reliably provided in all instances. The Company is and will continue to be required to modify its information systems,dedicate significant resources
31

Table of Contentsand incur significant exp
enses to comply with these requirements. However, the Company cannot eliminate the risks of unavailability of or errors in its reports.Product Design and Administration and Sales Practices
 - State and/or federal reg ulatory scrutiny of health care benefit product design and administration andmarketing and advertis
ing practices, including the filing of insurance policy forms, the adequacy of provider networks, the accuracy of provider directories, and theadequacy of disclosure reg
arding products and their administration, is increasing as are the penalties being imposed for inappropriate practices. Medicare, Medicaidand dual eligible prod
ucts and products offering more limited benefits in particular continue to attract increased regulatory scrutiny.Guaranty Fund Assessments/Solvency Protection
 - Under guaranty fund laws existing in all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (inmost states up to prescrib
ed limits) for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guarantyassociations in which the Company pa
rticipates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers as well as health insurers. TheCompany’s assessments general
ly are based on a formula relating to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers.Certain states allow assess
ments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors suchas not-for-profit consum
er governed health plans established under the ACA. While historically the Company has ultimately recovered more than half of guarantyfund assessments through statuto
rily permitted premium tax offsets, significant increases in assessments could lead to legislative and/or regulatory actions that limitfuture offsets.

Risks Related to COVID-19The spread of, impact of and response to COVID-19 underscores and amplifies c
ertain risks we face. The impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses,operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncerta
in, but the impact could be material and adverse.COVID-19 has spread to every state in th
e U.S., has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has severely impacted, and is expected tocontinue to severely imp
act, the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world.The legislative and regu
latory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and changing frequently, including the Families First Act, the CARES Act andmandated increases to 
the medical services we must pay for without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our Health Care Benefits Insuredproducts. As a result of COVID-19, including leg
islative and/or regulatory responses to COVID-19, the premiums we charge in our Insured Health Care Benefitsproducts may prove to be insuff
icient to cover the cost of medical services delivered to our Insured medical members, which may increase significantly as a resultof higher utilization rates 
of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs.Federal, state and loca
l governmental policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including shelter-in-place orders and social distancingdirectives, may not ef
fectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and have resulted in, among other things, a reduction in utilizationthat is discretionary, the
 cancellation of elective medical procedures, reduced customer traffic and front store sales in our retail pharmacies, our customers beingordered to close or sever
ely curtail their operations, the adoption of work-from-home policies and a reduction in diagnostic reporting due to reductions in healthcare provider visits and 
restrictions on our access to providers’ medical records, all of which impact our businesses. Among other impacts of these policies andinitiatives on our businesses, we 
expect changes in medical claims submission patterns and an adverse impact on (i) drug utilization due to the reduction indiscretionary visits with p
roviders; (ii) front store sales as a result of reduced customer traffic in our retail pharmacies due to shelter-in-place orders and COVID-19related unemployment
; (iii) medical membership in our Health Care Benefits segment and covered lives in our PBM clients due to reductions in workforce at ourexisting customers (inc
luding due to business failures) as well as reduced willingness to change benefits providers by prospective customers; (iv) benefit costs dueto COVID-19 related support programs we hav
e put in place for our medical members and mandated increases to the medical services we must pay for without acorresponding increase in 
the premiums we receive in our Insured Health Care Benefits products; and (v) the amount, timing and collectability of payments to theCompany from customers, cli
ents, government payers and members as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on them. Over time, these policies and initiatives alsomay cause us to experienc
e increased benefit costs and/or decreased revenues in our Health Care Benefits segment if, as a result of our medical members not seeingtheir providers as a resu
lt of COVID-19, we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to manage benefit costs and chronic conditions of our medical membersand appropriately documen
t their risk profiles.In addition, in response to COVID-19, during the 
first half of 2020, we began to offer our medical members expanded benefit coverage and became obligated bygovernmental action to p
rovide other additional coverage. This expanded benefit coverage is being provided without a corresponding increase in the premiums wereceive in our Insured Hea
lth Care Benefits products. We also are taking actions designed to help provide financial and administrative relief for the health careprovider community. Such measu
res and any further steps we take or are required to take to expand or otherwise modify the services delivered to our Health CareBenefits members, provi
de relief for the health care provider community, or in connection with the relaxation of shelter-in-place orders and social distancingdirectives and other r
estrictions on movement and economic activity intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including the potential for widespread testing andvaccination, as a componen
t of lifting those measures, could adversely impact our benefit costs, MBR and operating results.The various initiatives we h
ave implemented to slow and/or reduce the impact of COVID-19, such as colleagues working remotely and installing protectiveequipment in our retai
l pharmacies, and the COVID-19-related support programs we have put in place for our customers, medical members and colleagues haveincreased our operating 
expenses and reduced the efficiency of our operations. Our operating results will continue to be adversely affected so long as theseinitiatives continue o
r if they are expanded. In addition, the adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad caused by COVID-19 have had, and may continueto have, an adverse impac
t on our net investment income and the value of our investment portfolio.The spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to 
mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively,including as a result 
of the complete or partial closure of facilities, labor shortages and/or financial difficulties experienced by third-party service providers.Disruptions in our supply chains, our dist
ribution chains and/35

or public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, could materially and adversely impact our business operations. We havetransitioned a signifi
cant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as have a significant number ofour third-party servic
e providers, which may amplify certain risks to our businesses, including an increased demand for information technology resources,increased risk of phishing and o
ther cybersecurity attacks, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary orconfidential inform
ation about us or our medical members or other third-parties and increased risk of business interruptions.While the FDA has authorized some COVID-19 vac
cines for emergency use, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the severity and duration of thepandemic and scope and intens
ity of the governmental response to it are unknown at this time. We believe COVID-19’s impact on our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows and/or fin
ancial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’simpact on the U.S. and global econom
ies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation aswell as other federal, s
tate and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. As a result, the impactCOVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating r
esults, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-19 also may result in lega
l and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against us.A number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including COVID-19 and related testing and vac
cination, contribute to rising health care andother benefit costs. We may not be abl
e to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs, which could adversely affect our Health Care Benefitssegment’s operating results. There can be no assurance that future heal
th care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.As a result of COVID-19, the current econo
mic environment is adverse and less predictable than recently experienced, which has caused and may continue to causeunanticipated and signif
icant volatility in our health care and other benefits costs, including COVID-19 related testing and vaccination and post-acute care skillednursing facility and behav
ioral health costs. On January 21, 2021, the President of the United States issued an executive order to support government efforts toexpand access, availabi
lity and use of COVID-19 diagnostic, screening and surveillance and addressed the cost of COVID-19 testing by facilitating COVID-19testing free of charg
e to those who lack comprehensive health insurance and clarifying group health plans’ and health insurance issuers’ obligations to providecoverage for COVID-19 testing. In addi
tion, the timing of vaccine administration to the general public and related costs as well as the identification of new, moreinfectious strains of th
e COVID-19 virus and whether the vaccines will be effective against such new strains are uncertain and may impact our MBR. Premiums forour Insured Health Care Benefi
ts products, which comprised 92% of our Health Care Benefits revenues for 2020, are priced in advance based on our forecasts ofhealth care and other b
enefit costs during a fixed premium period, which is generally twelve months. These forecasts are typically developed several months beforethe fixed premium period 
begins, are influenced by historical data (and recent historical data in particular), are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detectmedical cost trends and c
hanges in our members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns and medical claim submission patterns and require a significantdegree of judgment. For examp
le, our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June of the year before the contract year. Cost increases in excessof our projections cannot be 
recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy ofour forecasts of the inc
reases in health care and other benefit costs that we expect to occur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. For 2021,those forecasts include 
adjustments made to pricing based on prospective expectations for liabilities due to testing, vaccines, direct COVID-19 treatment anddeferred care. Risk-ad
justed revenue has been adjusted for deferred care, and forecasted enrollment considers assumptions about the economic environment,though COVID-19 related impacts re
main uncertain. During periods such as 2020 and 2021 when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medicalcosts trends experience s
ignificant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19, accurately detecting,forecasting, managing, r
eserving and pricing for our (and our self-insured customers’) medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefitscosts is more challenging. Th
ere can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing, and ourhealth care and other b
enefit costs (including COVID-19 related testing and vaccination and post-acute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs) areaffected by COVID-19 and other exte
rnal events over which we have no control. Even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care andother benefit costs as a p
ercentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment’s operating results.A number of factors contribu
te to rising health care and other benefit costs, including COVID-19, previously uninsured members entering the health care system,changes in members’ beha
vior and health care utilization patterns, turnover in our membership, additional government mandated benefits or other regulatorychanges (including under the Fa
milies First Act and the CARES Act), changes in the health status of our members, the aging of the population and other changingdemographic charact
eristics, advances in medical technology, increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs (including specialty36

pharmacy drugs and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies), direct-to-consumer marketing by drug manufacturers, the increasing influence of social media on ourmembers’ health care utilization an
d other behaviors, changes in health care practices and general economic conditions (such as inflation and employment levels).In addition, government-i
mposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear agreater share of inc
reasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments or repeal or replacement of the ACA that increase the uninsuredpopulation may amplify th
is problem. Other factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include epidemics or other pandemics, changes as a result ofthe ACA, changes to or the discontinuat
ion of the ACA and other changes in the regulatory environment, the evolution toward a consumer driven business model,new technologies, influenza
-related health care costs (which may be substantial), clusters of high-cost cases, health care provider and member fraud, and numerousother factors that a
re or may be beyond our control.Furthermore, if we are 
not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reportedclaims or reported claims that 
have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit costexperience in our pric
ing process may be limited, which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These risks areparticularly acut
e during periods such as 2020 and 2021 when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical cost trends experience significantvolatility and medic
al claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19. Such risks are further magnified by the ACA and other existing andfuture legislation and reg
ulations that limit our ability to price for our projected and/or experienced increases in utilization and/or medical cost trends.There can be no assurance th
at future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.Adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad can materiall
y and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition,and we do not expect these conditions to improve 
in the near future.The COVID-19 pandemic, the availabi
lity and cost of credit and other capital, higher unemployment rates and other factors have contributed to adverse conditionsin the global economy and signi
ficantly diminished expectations for the global economy, and particularly the U.S. economy, at least through the end of 2020 andpossibly longer. Our customers, med
ical providers and the other companies with which we do business are generally headquartered in the U.S.; however, many ofour largest customers a
re global companies with operations around the world. As a result, adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, including thosecaused by COVID-19, can materially 
and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition, including:•
In our Pharmacy Services segment, by causing drug utilization to decline, reducing demand for PBM services and adversely affecting the financial healthof our PBM clients.
•
In our Retail/LTC segment, by causing drug utilization to decline, changing consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns leading toreduced consumer demand fo
r products sold in our stores and adversely affecting the financial health of our LTC pharmacy customers.•
By causing our existing customers to reduce workforces (including due to business failures), which would reduce our revenues, the number of coveredlives in our PBM clients and/or th
e number of members our Health Care Benefits segment serves.•
By causing our clients and customers and potential clients and customers, particularly those with the most employees or members, and state and localgovernments, to force us to co
mpete more vigorously on factors such as price and service, including service, discount and other performance guarantees,to retain or obtain the
ir business.•
By causing customers and potential customers of our Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits segments to purchase fewer products and/or products thatgenerate less profit 
for us than the ones they currently purchase or otherwise would have purchased.•
By causing customers and potential customers of our Health Care Benefits segment, particularly smaller employers and individuals, to forego obtaining orrenewing their health and o
ther coverage with us.•
In our Health Care Benefits segment, by causing unanticipated increases and volatility in utilization of medical and other covered services, includingCOVID-19 related testing, vaccin
ation and behavioral health services, by our medical members, changes in medical claim submission patterns and/orincreases in medica
l unit costs and/or provider behavior, each of which would increase our costs and limit our ability to accurately detect, forecast,manage, reserve and pri
ce for our (and our self-insured customers’) medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs.37

•By increasing medical unit costs and causing changes in provider behavior in our Health Care Benefits segment as hospitals and other providers attempt tomaintain revenue lev
els in their efforts to adjust to their own COVID-19-related and other economic challenges.•
By weakening the ability or perceived ability of the issuers and/or guarantors of the debt or other securities we hold in our investment portfolio to performon their obligations to us, which cou
ld result in defaults in those securities and has reduced, and may further reduce, the value of those securities and hascreated, and may continue
 to create, net realized capital losses for us that reduce our operating results.•
By weakening the ability of our customers, including self-insured customers in our Health Care Benefits segment, medical providers and the othercompanies with which we do business as well 
as our medical members to perform their obligations to us or causing them not to perform those obligations,either of which could reduc
e our operating results.•
By weakening the ability of our former subsidiaries and/or their purchasers to satisfy their lease obligations that we have guaranteed and causing theCompany to be required to satis
fy those obligations.•
By weakening the financial condition of other insurers, including long-term care insurers and life insurers, which increases the risk that we will receivesignificant assessments 
for obligations of insolvent insurers to policyholders and claimants.•
By causing, over time, inflation that could cause interest rates to increase and thereby increase our interest expense and reduce our operating results, aswell as decrease the va
lue of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio, which would reduce our operating results and/or adversely affect ourfinancial condition.
Furthermore, reductions in work
force by our customers can cause unanticipated increases in the health care and other benefits costs of our Health Care Benefitssegment. For example, our business 
associated with members who have elected to receive benefits under Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (knownas “COBRA”) typically has an MBR that is signif
icantly higher than our overall Commercial MBR.Risks Relating to Our Businesses
Each of our segments operates in a highly competit
ive and evolving business environment; and gross margins in the industries in which we compete maydecline.
Each of our segments, Pharmacy Se
rvices, which includes our pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) business, Retail/LTC, and Health Care Benefits, operates ina highly competitive and 
evolving business environment. Specifically:•
As competition increases in the geographies in which we operate, including competition from new entrants, a significant increase in price compression and/orreimbursement pressur
es could occur, and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive.•
The competitive success of our Pharmacy Services segment is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with networkpharmacies as PBM clients ev
aluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks.•
The competitive success of our Retail/LTC segment and our specialty pharmacy operations is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractualrelationships with PBMs and other payors on 
acceptable terms as the payors’ clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks.•
In our PBM business, we maintain contractual relationships with brand name drug manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugsdispensed by pharmacies in our 
retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients).Manufacturer’s reba
tes often depend on a PBM’s ability to meet contractual requirements, including the placement of a manufacturer’s products on the PBM’sformularies. If we lose ou
r relationship with one or more drug manufacturers, or if the discounts or rebates provided by drug manufacturers decline, ouroperating results, cash f
lows and/or prospects could be adversely affected.•
The PBM industry has been experiencing price compression as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices, increasedrevenue sharing, inclu
ding sharing in a larger portion of rebates received from drug manufacturers, enhanced service offerings and/or higher service levels.Marketplace dynamics 
and regulatory changes also have adversely affected our ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes the use of retail“differential” o
r “spread,” which could adversely affect our future profitability, and we expect these trends to continue.•
Our retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and LTC pharmacy operations have been affected by reimbursement pressure caused by competition, including clientdemands for lower prices, gen
eric drug pricing, earlier than expected generic drug introductions and network reimbursement pressure. If we are unable toincrease our prices to reflect,
 or otherwise mitigate38

the impact of, increasing costs, our profitability will be adversely affected. If we are unable to limit our price increases, we may lose customers to competitorswith more favorable pri
cing, adversely affecting our revenues and operating results.•
A shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates as a result of competition or otherwise couldadversely affect our 
margins, including the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day prescriptions at retail and the ongoing shift in pharmacy mixtowards Medicare Part D presc
riptions.•
PBM client contracts often are for a period of approximately three years. However, PBM clients may require early or periodic re-negotiation of pricing prior tocontract expiration. PBM cl
ients are generally well informed, can move between us and our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration oftheir contracts. We 
are therefore under pressure to contain price increases despite being faced with increasing drug costs and increasing operating costs. If weare unable to increase our
 prices to reflect, or otherwise mitigate the impact of, increasing costs, our profitability will be adversely affected. If we are unable tolimit our price inc
reases, we may lose customers to competitors with more favorable pricing, adversely affecting our revenues and operating results.•
The operating results and margins of our LTC business are further affected by the increased efforts of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitatedpricing arrangements 
and by the financial health of, and purchases and sales of, our LTC customers.•
In our Health Care Benefits segment we are seeking to substantially grow our Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan membership over thenext several years. In m
any instances, to acquire and retain our government customers’ business, we must bid against our competitors in a highly competitiveenvironment. Winning bids oft
en are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidders, and may also be withdrawn or cancelled by the issuing agency.•
Customer contracts in our Health Care Benefits segment are generally for a period of one year, and our customers have considerable flexibility in movingbetween us and our competitors. One o
f the key factors on which we compete for customers, especially in uncertain economic environments, is overall cost.We are therefore under press
ure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing health care and other benefit costs and increasingoperating costs. If 
we are unable to increase our prices to reflect, or otherwise mitigate the impact of, increasing costs, our profitability will be adverselyaffected. If we are unable t
o limit our price increases, we may lose members to competitors with more favorable pricing, adversely affecting our revenues andoperating results. In respons
e to rising prices, our customers may elect to self-insure or to reduce benefits in order to limit increases in their benefit costs.Alternatively, our custom
ers may purchase different types of products from us that are less profitable. Such elections may result in reduced membership in ourmore profitable Insur
ed products and/or lower premiums for our Insured products, which may adversely affect our revenues and operating results, althoughsuch elections also may r
educe our health care and other benefit costs. In addition, our Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP products are subject to terminationwithout cause, periodic re
-bid, rate adjustment and program redesign, as customers seek to contain their benefit costs, particularly in an uncertain economy,and our exposure to this risk is in
creasing as we grow our Government products membership. These actions may adversely affect our membership, revenuesand operating results.
•
We requested increases in our premium rates in our Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2021 and expect to continue to request increases in thoserates for 2022 and beyond in order 
to adequately price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significantassessments, fees and taxes 
imposed by federal and state governments, including as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the HealthCare and Education Reconcili
ation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”). Our rates also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our products will be selectedby people with a higher risk prof
ile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established pricing for the applicable products (alsoknown as “adverse selection”
), particularly in small group Commercial products. These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adversepublicity, adverse regul
atory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied, reduced or delayed,which could lead to operating 
margin compression.In addition, competitors 
in each of our businesses may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer. Competition also may comefrom new entrants and other sou
rces in the future. Unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings in therapidly changing health c
are industry, we may be unable to remain competitive.Disruptive innovation by existing o
r new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess suchalterations and make 
timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. For example, decisions to buy our PharmacyServices and Health Care Benef
its products and services increasingly are made or influenced by consumers, either through direct purchasing (e.g., MedicareAdvantage plans and PDPs) or through public hea
lth insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) and private health insurance exchanges (together with PublicExchanges, collectively, 
“Insurance Exchanges”) that allow individual choice. Consumers also are increasingly seeking to access consumer goods and health careproducts and services loca
lly and through other direct channels such as mobile39

devices and websites. To compete effectively in the consumer-driven marketplace, we will be required to develop or acquire new capabilities, attract new talent anddevelop new service and distr
ibution relationships that respond to consumer needs and preferences.Changes in marketplace dyna
mics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation, the emergence of new competitors and strategicalliances, and decisions 
to exclude us from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks could materially and adversely affect our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows and/or prospe
cts.A change in our Health Care Benefits product mix may adverse
ly affect our profit margins.Our Insured Health Care Benefits p
roducts that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our ASC products. Historically, smalleremployer groups have been mor
e likely to purchase Insured Health Care Benefits products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to beargreater liabili
ty for health care expenditures, although over the last several years even relatively small employers have moved to ASC products. We also serve, andexpect to grow our business with, governm
ent-sponsored programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, that are subject to competitive bids and have lower profitmargins than our Commerci
al Insured Health Care Benefits products. A shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have amaterial adverse effect on the 
Health Care Benefits segment’s operating results.Negative public perception of the 
industries in which we operate, or of our industries’ or our practices, can adversely affect our businesses, operating results,cash flows and prospects.
Our brand and reputation are 
two of our most important assets, and the industries in which we operate have been and are negatively perceived by the public fromtime to time. Negativ
e publicity may come as a result of adverse media coverage, litigation against us and other industry participants, the ongoing public debatesover drug pricing, PBMs, government involv
ement in drug pricing and purchasing, the future of the ACA, “surprise” medical bills, governmental hearings and/orinvestigations, actual o
r perceived shortfalls regarding our industries’ or our own products and/or business practices (including PBM operations, drug pricing andinsurance coverage determinatio
ns) and social media and other media relations activities. Negative publicity also may come from a failure to meet customerexpectations for consist
ent, high quality and accessible care. This risk may increase as we continue to offer products and services that make greater use of data andas our business model becomes mo
re focused on delivering health care to consumers.In addition, by working with the U.S. government 
in the distribution and administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Company may be subject to negativepublicity related to 
the government’s actions in response to COVID-19 that are outside of the ability of the Company to control.Negative public percept
ion and/or publicity of our industries in general, or of us or our key vendors, brokers or product distribution networks in particular, canfurther increase our 
costs of doing business and adversely affect our operating results and our stock price by:•
adversely affecting our brand and reputation;•
adversely affecting our ability to market and sell our products and/or services and/or retain our existing customers and members;•
requiring us to change our products and/or services;•
reducing or restricting the revenue we can receive for our products and/or services; and/or•
increasing or significantly changing the regulatory and legislative requirements with which we must comply.We must maintain and improve our relationships with our retail and spe
cialty pharmacy customers and increase the demand for our products and services,including proprietary brands.
The success of our businesses depends in p
art on customer loyalty, superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to frequent our retail stores andonline sites and to purchase p
roducts in additional categories and our proprietary brands. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumerpreferences and spending pa
tterns, and evolving demographic mixes in the communities we serve, an inability to expand the products being purchased by ourclients and customers, or 
the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could adversely affect our relationship with our customers andclients and the demand fo
r our products and services and could result in excess inventories of products.40

We offer our retail customers proprietary brand products that are available exclusively at our retail stores and through our online retail sites. The sale of proprietaryproducts subjects us to unique risks 
including potential product liability risks, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, potential supply chain and distribution chaindisruptions for raw mater
ials and finished products, our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties, andother risks generally en
countered by entities that source, market and sell private-label products. We also face similar risks for the other products we sell in our retailoperations, including supply cha
in and distribution chain disruption risk. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effecton our retail business, opera
ting results, cash flows and/or financial condition. Additionally, an increase in the sales of our proprietary brands may adversely affectour sales of products owned by our supplie
rs and adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stablesuppliers who satisfy our requir
ements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, thatcustomer confidence is no
t diminished. Any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our operatingresults and erode custome
r loyalty.We also could be adversely 
affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in marketplace dynamics. For example, specialty pharmacy represents asignificant and growing proport
ion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies.Because our specialty phar
macy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited numberof pharmacies (so-called limited 
distribution drugs) that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of our specialty pharmacy businessdepends largely upon expanding our a
ccess to key drugs and penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction indemand for the prescrip
tions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business, operating results and cash flows.We face risks relating to the avai
lability, pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell.The profitability of our Re
tail/LTC and Pharmacy Services segments is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. We dispense significantvolumes of brand name and gene
ric drugs from our retail, LTC, specialty and mail order pharmacies, and the retail pharmacies in our PBM’s network also dispensesignificant volumes of br
and name and generic drugs. Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions fordrugs or the utilization o
f drugs is reduced, including due to:•
increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions;•
manufacturing or other supply issues;•
certain products being withdrawn by their manufacturers or transitioned to over-the-counter products;•
future FDA rulings restricting the supply or increasing the cost of products;•
the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs or lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products; or•
inflation in the price of brand name drugs.In addition, increased ut
ilization of generic drugs (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs) has resulted in pressure todecrease reimburse
ment payments to retail, mail order, specialty and LTC pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in our margins on sales of genericdrugs. Consolidation within the gener
ic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increasepricing of generic drugs and d
iminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased brand name or genericprescription drug acquisi
tion costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on ouroperating results.
A number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, contribute to ris
ing health care and other benefit costs. We may not be able to accurately forecasthealth care and other benefit costs, which could adverse
ly affect our Health Care Benefits segment’s operating results.Premiums for our Insured Heal
th Care Benefits products, which comprised 92% of our Health Care Benefits revenues for 2020, are priced in advance based on ourforecasts of health c
are and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period, which is generally one year. These forecasts are typically developed several monthsbefore the fixed premium peri
od begins, are influenced by historical data (and recent historical data in particular), are dependent on our ability to anticipate anddetect medical cos
t trends and changes in our members’ behavior and health care utilization patterns and require a significant degree of judgment. For example, ourrevenue on Medicare poli
cies is based on bids submitted in June of the year before the contract year. Cost increases in excess of our projections cannot berecovered in the fixed p
remium period through higher premiums. As41

a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. Even relatively smalldifferences between predicted
 and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in ouroperating results.
A number of factors contribu
te to rising health care and other benefit costs, including previously uninsured members entering the health care system, changes inmembers’ behavior and he
alth care utilization patterns, turnover in our membership, additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, changesin the health status of our 
members, the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology, increases in thenumber and cost of prescrip
tion drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies), direct-to-consumer marketing by drugmanufacturers, the increasing
 influence of social media on our members’ health care utilization and other behaviors, changes in health care practices and generaleconomic conditions (s
uch as inflation and employment levels). In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to healthplans and providers have caused 
the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments orrepeal or replacement of the 
ACA that increase the uninsured population may exacerbate this problem. Other factors that affect our health care and other benefitcosts include changes as a r
esult of the ACA, changes to the ACA and other changes in the regulatory environment, the evolution toward a consumer drivenbusiness model, new technologies, in
fluenza related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we project), clusters of high-cost cases, epidemicsor pandemics, health ca
re provider and member fraud, and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control. For example, the 2020-2021 influenzaseason was impacted by effor
ts taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and the 2019-2020 influenza season had an earlier than average start and had a higherincidence of influenz
a than the 2018-2019 influenza season.Our Health Care Benefits segmen
t’s operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and otherbenefit costs through underwri
ting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical managementprograms. Our medical cost 
management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect. Thefactors described above ma
y adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our competitivenessand operating results.
The reserves we hold for expected cla
ims in our Insured Health Care Benefits products are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgmentand are inherently variable. Any reserve, including a pre
mium deficiency reserve, may be insufficient. If actual claims exceed our estimates, our operatingresults could be materially adv
ersely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.A large portion of health c
are claims are not submitted to us until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to our members. Ourreported health care costs 
payable for any particular period reflect our estimates of the ultimate cost of such claims as well as claims that have been reported to usbut not yet paid. We also must 
estimate the amount of rebates payable under the MLR rules of the ACA, CMS and the OPM and the amounts payable by us to, andreceivable by us from, th
e United States federal government under the ACA’s remaining premium stabilization program.Our estimates of health 
care costs payable are based on a number of factors, including those derived from historical claim experience, but this estimation processalso makes use of extensive 
judgment. Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes inmedical claims subm
ission and processing patterns and/or procedures, turnover and other changes in membership, changes in product mix, changes in theutilization of medical and/or 
other covered services, including prescription drugs, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our medical management practicesand the introduction of new bene
fits and products. We estimate health care costs payable periodically, and any resulting adjustments, including premium deficiencyreserves, are refl
ected in current-period operating results within benefit costs. For example, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we established a premiumdeficiency reserve o
f $11 million and $4 million, respectively, related to Medicaid products in the Health Care Benefits segment. A worsening (or improvement) ofhealth care cost tr
end rates or changes in claim payment patterns from those that we assumed in estimating health care costs payable as of December 31, 2020would cause these estimat
es to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.Furthermore, if we are 
not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reportedclaims or reported claims that 
have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit costexperience in our pric
ing process may be limited, which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These risks areparticularly acut
e during and following periods when utilization of medical and/or other covered services and/or medical cost trends are below recent historicallevels and in products where th
ere is significant turnover in our membership each year, and such risks are42

further magnified by the ACA and other legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected and/or experienced increases in utilization and/ormedical cost trends.
Our operating results are affected by the heal
th of the economy in general and in the geographies we serve.Our businesses are affect
ed by the U.S. economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geographies we serve, including various economic factors,including inflation and ch
anges in consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns. An unfavorable, uncertain or volatile economic environmentcould cause a decline in d
rug utilization, an increase in health care utilization and dampen demand for PBM services as well as consumer demand for products soldin our retail stores.
If our customers’ operatin
g and financial performance deteriorates, or they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain adequate financing, our customersmay not be able to pay tim
ely, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us. Any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services may adverselyaffect our businesses, oper
ating results and cash flows. In addition, both state and federal government sponsored payers, as a result of budget deficits or spendingreductions, may suspend payments o
r seek to reduce their health care expenditures resulting in our customers delaying payments to us or renegotiating theircontracts with us.
Further, economic conditions 
including interest rate fluctuations, changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes may affect our ability to obtainnecessary financing on
 acceptable terms, our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms, our ability to execute sale-leaseback transactionsunder acceptable te
rms and the value of our investment portfolio. Adverse changes in the U.S. economy, consumer confidence and economic conditions could havean adverse effect on our bus
inesses and financial results. This adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible healthplans and health plan designs f
avoring co-insurance over co-payments as members and other consumers may decide to postpone, or not to seek, medical treatmentwhich may lead them to incu
r more expensive medical treatment in the future and/or decrease our prescription volumes.In addition, our Health Care Bene
fits membership remains concentrated in certain U.S. geographies and in certain industries. Unfavorable changes in health care orother benefit costs or reim
bursement rates or increased competition in those geographic areas where our membership is concentrated could therefore have adisproportionately advers
e effect on our Health Care Benefits segment’s operating results. Our Health Care Benefits membership has been and may continue to beaffected by workforce r
eductions by our customers due to adverse and/or uncertain general economic conditions, especially in the U.S. geographies and industrieswhere our membership is conc
entrated. As a result, we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our Health Care Benefits membership geographically, byproduct type or by customer indus
try, and our revenues and operating results may be disproportionately affected by adverse changes affecting our customers.We are exposed to risks relating to the sol
vency of other insurers.We are subject to assess
ments under guaranty fund laws existing in all states for obligations of insolvent insurance companies (including long-term care insurers),HMOs, ACA co-ops and other payors to policyholders and c
laimants. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, Aetna recorded a discounted estimated liabilityexpense of $231 million pret
ax for our estimated share of future assessments for long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and oneof its subsidiaries. Guaranty 
funds are maintained by state insurance commissioners to protect policyholders and claimants in the event that an insurer, HMO, ACAco-op and/or other payor beco
mes insolvent or is unable to meet its financial obligations. These funds are usually financed by assessments against insurersregulated by a state. Futur
e assessments may have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Extreme events, or the threat of extr
eme events, could materially increase our health care (including behavioral health) costs.Nuclear, biological or oth
er attacks, whether as a result of war or terrorism, other man-made disasters, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics and other extremeevents can affect th
e U.S. economy in general, our industries and us specifically. In particular, such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events could resultin significant health 
care (including behavioral health) costs, which also would be affected by the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public healthagencies and other insure
rs. Such extreme events or the threat of such extreme events also could disrupt our supply chains and/or our distribution chains for theproducts we sell. In addition, our 
employees and those of our vendors are concentrated in certain large, metropolitan areas which may be particularly exposed tothese events. Such events could adv
ersely affect our businesses,43

operating results and cash flows, and, in the event of extreme circumstances, our financial condition or viability, particularly if our responses to such events are lessadequate than those of our co
mpetitors.Risks From Changes in Public Policy and Other Legal and Regulatory Risks
We are subject to potential changes in public po
licy, laws and regulations, including reform of the U.S. health care system, which can adversely affect ourbusinesses. Entitlement program reform, if 
it occurs, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operations and/or operating results.The political environm
ent in which we operate remains uncertain. It is reasonably possible that our business operations and operating results could be materiallyadversely affected by legislati
ve, regulatory and public policy changes at the federal or state level, increased government involvement in drug reimbursement,pricing, purchasing and/or i
mportation and/or increased regulation of PBMs, including: changes to the Medicare or Medicaid programs (including the block grantoption outlined by CMS on January 30, 2020, the “block g
rant option”) or the regulatory environment for health care and related benefits, including the ACA;changes to laws or regulations gov
erning drug reimbursement and/or pricing; changes to the laws and regulations governing PBMs’, PDPs’ and/or ManagedMedicaid organizations
’ interactions with government funded health care programs; changes to laws and/or regulations governing drug manufacturers’ rebates;changes to laws and/or regula
tions governing reimbursements paid to pharmacists by and/or reporting required by PBMs; changes to immigration policies and/orother public policy init
iatives. It is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take (includingthrough the use of U.S. Presidential Exe
cutive Orders). Other significant changes to health care and related benefits system legislation or regulation as well aschanges with respect to tax 
and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries also arepossible and could adversely a
ffect our businesses. If we fail to respond adequately to such changes, including by implementing strategic and operationalinitiatives, or do not respond 
as effectively as our competitors, our businesses, operations and operating results may be materially adversely affected.In addition to efforts to 
amend, repeal or replace the ACA and related regulations, we expect the federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriouslyconsider many broad-based l
egislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits systemand our businesses. Potential modi
fication to the ACA, including changes in enforcement and/or funding that further destabilize the Public Exchanges, as well assignificant changes to Med
icaid funding (including the block grant option) could impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently,prescription drug coverag
e. Further changes to federal health care and related benefits laws, including the ACA, drug reimbursement and pricing laws, lawsgoverning PBMs and/or laws governing PBMs’, PDPs’ and/or Managed Med
icaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health care programs, areprobable. We cannot predi
ct the effect, if any, that new health care and related benefits legislation, future changes to the ACA or the implementation of or failure toimplement the outstand
ing provisions of ACA, may have on our Pharmacy Services, retail pharmacy, LTC pharmacy and/or Health Care Benefits operations and/oroperating results. The fed
eral and many state governments also are considering changes in the interpretation, enforcement and/or application of existing programs,laws and regulations, including 
changes to payments under and funding of Medicare and Medicaid programs and increased regulation of PBMs.Further, changes in existing f
ederal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to additional regulation of PBMs (includingformulary managemen
t or other PBM services), drug pricing or purchasing, patent term extensions and/or purchase discount and/or rebate arrangements with drugmanufacturers also cou
ld reduce the discounts or rebates we receive. Changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws orregulations relating 
to claims processing and billing, including our ability to use MAC lists and collect transmission fees, also could adversely affect ourprofitability. For examp
le, on October 29, 2020, the HHS released a final rule requiring health insurers to disclose drug pricing and cost-sharing information. Thefinal rule requires g
roup health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose cost-sharing information upon request, to aparticipant, benefi
ciary, or enrollee, which, unless otherwise indicated, for the purpose of the final rules includes an authorized representative, and requires plansand issuers to disclose in-ne
twork provider rates, historical out-of-network allowed amounts and the associated billed charges, andnegotiated rates for p
rescription drugs. The public disclosure of insurer- or PBM-negotiated price concessions may result in drug manufacturers lowering discountsor rebates, resulting in h
igher drug costs for patients and impacting the ability of the Company to negotiate drug prices and provide competitive products andservices to consumers.
In addition, in November 2020, the HHS rele
ased the Rebate Rule, which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the AKS for rebates frompharmaceutical co
mpanies to PBMs in Medicare Part D and in Medicaid MCOs, replacing it with two far narrower safe harbors designed to directly benefit patientswith high out-of-pocket costs and 
to change the way PBMs are compensated. The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to the patient at the pointof sale
44

and (ii) for flat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. The PCMA, which represents PBMs, has filed a suit in an effortto block the Rebate Rule, cla
iming that the Rebate Rule would lead to higher premiums in Medicare Part D and was adopted in an unlawful manner. It is unclearwhether the Rebate Rule will be 
enforceable, whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices, whether list prices in the private market mayalso be reduced, and what the r
esulting impact will be to PBMs or the Company.We cannot predict the 
enactment or content of new legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement, interpretation orapplication, or the ef
fect they will have on our business operations or operating results, which could be materially adverse. Even if we could predict such matters, itis not possible to elimina
te the adverse impact of public policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of one or more of the industries in whichwe compete. Examples of such ch
anges include: the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available forMedicare, Medicaid, dua
l eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs, increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing, purchasing and/orimportation, changing the 
laws and regulations governing PBMs’, PDPs’ and/or Managed Medicaid organizations’ interactions with government funded health careprograms, changing the tax t
reatment of health or related benefits, or repealing or otherwise significantly altering the ACA. The likelihood of adverse changesremains high due to state 
and federal budgetary pressures, and our businesses and operating results could be materially and adversely affected by such changes,even if we correctly predict
 their occurrence.For more information on thes
e matters, see “Government Regulation” included in Item 1 of this 10-K.If we fail to comply with applicab
le laws and regulations, many of which are highly complex, we could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions orsuffer brand and reputational harm.
Our businesses are subject to ex
tensive regulation and oversight by state, federal and international governmental authorities. The laws and regulations governingour operations and interpr
etations of those laws and regulations are increasing in number and complexity, change frequently and can be inconsistent or conflictwith one another. In general, 
these laws and regulations are designed to benefit and protect customers, members and providers rather than us or our investors. Inaddition, the governmenta
l authorities that regulate our businesses have broad latitude to make, interpret and enforce the laws and regulations that govern us andcontinue to interpret 
and enforce those laws and regulations more strictly and more aggressively each year. We also must follow various restrictions on certain ofour businesses and the payment of d
ividends by certain of our subsidiaries put in place by certain state regulators.Certain of our Pharmacy Servi
ces and Retail/LTC operations, products and services are subject to:•
the clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs and other health care products and services,including claims rel
ated to purported dispensing and other operational errors (any failure by our Pharmacy Services and/or Retail/LTC operations to adhere tothe laws and regulations appl
icable to the dispensing of drugs could subject us to civil and criminal penalties);•
federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern our relationship with drug manufacturers, customers and consumers;•
compliance requirements under ERISA, including fiduciary obligations in connection with the development and implementation of items such as drugformularies and pref
erred drug listings; and•
federal and state legislative proposals and/or regulatory activity that could adversely affect pharmacy benefit industry practices.Our Health Care Benefits products 
are highly regulated, particularly those that serve Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible, dual eligible special needs and small groupCommercial customers 
and members. The laws and regulations governing participation in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, dual eligible and dualeligible special needs plan
 programs are complex, are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for non-compliance.The scope of the practic
es and activities that are prohibited by federal and state false claims acts is the subject of pending litigation. Claims under federal and statefalse claims acts 
can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” suit, and we a re adefendant in a number of such p
roceedings. If we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a government program or if there is anadverse decision against us und
er the False Claims Act, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from participating in government health care programs,including Medicare Advantag
e, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs, and we also may be required to paysignificant fines and/o
r other monetary penalties. Whistleblower suits have45

resulted in significant settlements between governmental agencies and health care companies. The significant incentives and protections provided towhistleblowers under applicab
le law increase the risk of whistleblower suits.If we fail to comply with l
aws and regulations that apply to government programs, we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties, premium refunds,prohibitions on marketing or 
active or passive enrollment of members, corrective actions, termination of our contracts or other sanctions which could have amaterial adverse effect on our a
bility to participate in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, dual eligible, dual eligible special needs plan and otherprograms and on our operating r
esults, cash flows and financial condition.Our businesses, profitability 
and growth also may be adversely affected by (i) judicial and regulatory decisions that change and/or expand the interpretations ofexisting statutes and regu
lations, impose medical or bad faith liability, increase our responsibilities under ERISA or the remedies available under ERISA, or reducethe scope of ERISA pre-emption of st
ate law claims or (ii) other legislation and regulations. For example, in December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld anArkansas law that, among other th
ings, mandates a particular pricing methodology, establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is belowthe pharmacy’s acquisi
tion cost, permits a pharmacy to reverse and rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than thereimbursement rat
e, prohibits a PBM from reimbursing a pharmacy less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis, and permits a pharmacy todecline to dispense if th
e reimbursement is lower than the pharmacy’s acquisition cost.If our compliance or other systems and processes 
fail or are deemed inadequate, we may suffer brand and reputational harm and become subject to regulatoryactions and/or litigation.
In addition to being subject 
to extensive and complex regulations, many of our contracts with customers include detailed requirements. In order to be eligible tooffer certain produc
ts or bid on certain contracts, we must demonstrate that we have robust systems and processes in place that are designed to maintain compliancewith all applicable l
egal, regulatory and contractual requirements. These systems and processes frequently are reviewed and audited by our customers andregulators. If our systems 
and processes designed to maintain compliance with applicable legal and contractual requirements, and to prevent and detect instancesof, or the potential for, non
-compliance fail or are deemed inadequate, we may suffer brand and reputational harm and be subject to regulatory actions, litigationand other proceedings which may 
result in damages, fines, suspension or loss of licensure, suspension or exclusion from participation in government programsand/or other penalties, 
any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.We routinely are subject to lit
igation and other adverse legal proceedings, including class actions and qui tam actions. Many of these proceedings seeksubstantial damages which may not be covered by insurance. These pro
ceedings are costly to defend, may result in changes in our business practices, harm ourbrand and reputation and adversely affect our businesses and operating results.
PBM, retail pharmacy, mai
l order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, LTC pharmacy and health care and related benefits are highly regulated industries whoseparticipants frequently are s
ubject to litigation and other adverse legal proceedings. We are currently subject to various litigation and arbitration matters,investigations, regulato
ry audits, inspections, government inquiries, and regulatory and other legal proceedings, both inside and outside the U.S. Outside the U.S.,contractual rights, t
ax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the U.S. Litigation related toour provision of professional se
rvices in our medical clinics, pharmacies and LTC operations is increasing as we expand our services along the continuum of healthcare.
Litigation, and particularly
 securities, derivative, collective or class action and qui tam  litigation, is often exp ensive and disruptive. Many of the legal proceedingsagainst us seek substantial d
amages (including non-economic or punitive damages and treble damages), and certain of these proceedings also seek changes in ourbusiness practices. Whil
e we currently have insurance coverage for some potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurersmay dispute coverage and/o
r the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded or costs incurred. In addition, some types of damages,like punitive damages, m
ay not be covered by insurance, and in some jurisdictions the coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all orsome forms of liabili
ty also may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.The outcome of litigat
ion and other adverse legal proceedings is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justifiable by the evidence or existing law orregulation can and do occur, 
and the costs incurred frequently are substantial regardless of the outcome. Litigation and other adverse legal proceedings couldmaterially advers
ely affect our businesses, operating results and/or cash flows because of brand and reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings, the cost ofdefending such proceedings,
46

the cost of settlement or judgments against us, or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings. See Item 3 of this 10-K for additionalinformation.
We frequently are subject to regular and spec
ial governmental audits, investigations and reviews that could result in changes to our business practices and alsocould result in material refunds, fines, penalt
ies, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities and other sanctions.As one of the largest nationa
l retail, mail order, specialty and LTC pharmacy, PBM and health care and related benefits providers, we frequently are subject toregular and special gove
rnmental market conduct and other audits, investigations and reviews by, and we receive subpoenas and other requests for informationfrom, various federal 
and state agencies, regulatory authorities, attorneys general, committees, subcommittees and members of the U.S. Congress and other state,federal and interna
tional governmental authorities. For example, we have received CIDs from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division ofthe DOJ in connection with a curren
t investigation of our patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under Parts C and Dof the Medicare progra
m. CMS and the OIG also are auditing the risk adjustment-related data of certain of our Medicare Advantage plans, and the number of suchaudits continues to incre
ase. Several such audits, investigations and reviews by governmental authorities currently are pending, some of which may be resolved in2021, the results of which may be adv
erse to us.Federal and state governm
ents have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud, waste and abuse a priority. Fraud, waste and abuseprohibitions encompass a wide r
ange of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical and/or other covered services,improper marketing and v
iolations of patient privacy rights. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us and other industry participants arecomplex and subject to chang
e, making it necessary for us to invest significant resources in complying with our regulatory and contractual requirements. Ongoingvigorous law enforcement and 
the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. Inaddition, our medical cos
ts and the medical expenses of our Health Care Benefits ASC customers may be adversely affected if we do not prevent or detectfraudulent activity by p
roviders and/or members.Regular and special governm
ental audits, investigations and reviews by federal, state and international regulators could result in changes to our business practices,and also could result in signi
ficant or material premium refunds, fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including suspension orexclusion from partic
ipation in government programs and suspension or loss of licensure. Any of these audits, investigations or reviews could have a materialadverse effect on our busin
esses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition or result in significant liabilities and negative publicity for us.See “Legal and Regulatory Proce
edings” in Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Our litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing as we off
er new products and services and expand in business areas beyond our historical corebusinesses of Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Hea
lth Care Benefits.Historically, we focused pri
marily on providing Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits products and services. As a result of our transformationprogram and other innovation 
initiatives, we are expanding our presence in the health care space and plan to offer new products and services (such as the homehemodialysis device we ar
e developing) which present a different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the products and services that we historically haveoffered.
The increased volume of busin
ess in areas beyond our historical core businesses and new products and services subject us to litigation and regulatory risks that aredifferent from the 
risks of providing Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits products and services and increase significantly our exposure toother risks.
We face unique regulatory and other challenges in our Medicare and Med
icaid businesses.We are seeking to substant
ially grow the Medicare and Medicaid membership in our Health Care Benefits segment in 2020 and over the next several years. Weface unique regulatory 
and other challenges that may inhibit the growth and profitability of those businesses.•
In April 2020, CMS issued a final notice detailing final Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates for 2021 (the “Final Notice”). Overall, we project thebenchmark rates in the Fin
al Notice will increase funding for our Medicare Advantage47

business, excluding the impact of the HIF in 2020, by approximately 1.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. This 2021 rate increase only partially offsets thechallenge we face from the im
pact of the increasing cost of medical care (including prescription medications) and CMS local and national coverage decisionsthat require us to pay for s
ervices and supplies that are not factored into our bids and creates continued pressure on our Medicare Advantage operating results.In January 2021, CMS issued its final noti
ce detailing final 2022 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage ratesresulted in an increase in
 industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%. We cannot predict future Medicare funding levels, the impact of future federalbudget actions or ensure tha
t such changes or actions will not have an adverse effect on our Medicare operating results.•
The organic expansion of our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D service area is subject to the ability of CMS to process our requests for service areaexpansions and our ability to bui
ld cost competitive provider networks in the expanded service areas that meet applicable network adequacy requirements.CMS’ decisions on our requests for serv
ice area expansions also may be affected adversely by compliance issues that arise each year in our Medicareoperations.
•
CMS regularly audits our performance to determine our compliance with CMS’s regulations and our contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of theservices we provide to our Medi
care members. As a result of these audits, we may be subject to significant or material retroactive adjustments to and/orwithholding of certain pre
miums and fees, fines, criminal liability, civil monetary penalties, CMS imposed sanctions (including suspension or exclusion fromparticipation in govern
ment programs) or other restrictions on our Medicare, Medicaid and other businesses, including suspension or loss of licensure.•
“Star ratings” from CMS for our Medicare Advantage plans will continue to have a significant effect on our plans’ operating results. Since 2015, onlyMedicare Advantage plans with 
a star rating of four or higher (out of five) are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. CMS continues tochange its rating system 
to make achieving and maintaining a four or higher star rating more difficult. Our star ratings and past performance scores areadversely affected by 
the compliance issues that arise each year in our Medicare operations. If our star ratings fall below four for a significant portion of ourMedicare Advantage memb
ership or do not match the performance of our competitors or the star rating quality bonuses are reduced or eliminated, ourrevenues, operating resul
ts and cash flows may be significantly adversely affected.•
Payments we receive from CMS for our Medicare Advantage and Part D businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of theindividuals we enroll. Elem
ents of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the DOJ, the OIG and CMS itself. Substantial changes in therisk adjustment mechan
ism, including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions, could materially affect the amount of our Medicarereimbursement, require us t
o raise prices or reduce the benefits we offer to Medicare beneficiaries, and potentially limit our (and the industry’s) participationin the Medicare program.
•
Changes to the ability of PBMs to have pharmacy performance programs in place for clients and report payments via direct and indirect reporting mechanismscould impact the Pharma
cy Services business.•
Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory andcompetitive pressures. Fur
ther, as a result of the ACA and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules, clients of our PBM business could decide to discontinueproviding prescription drug ben
efits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this phenomenon occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customermigration into Medica
re Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D products.•
Our Medicare Part D operating results and our ability to expand our Medicare Part D business could be adversely affected if: the cost and complexity ofMedicare Part D exceed ma
nagement’s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; changes to the regulations regarding howdrug costs are reported
 for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; changes tothe applicable regulations im
pact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; the government alters Medicare Part D programrequirements or reduc
es funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; the government mandateduse of point-of-sale man
ufacturer’s rebates effective in 2022 continues; the government makes changes to how pharmacy pay-for-performance is calculated; orreinsurance thresholds a
re reduced below their current levels.•
We have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our Medicaid products due to difficulties with providers and third-partyvendors submitting claims 
in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions. As states increase their relianceon encounter data, these di
fficulties could affect the Medicaid premium rates we receive and how Medicaid membership is assigned to us, which could have amaterial adverse 
effect on our Medicaid operating results and cash flows and/or our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain Medicaidprograms.
48

•Federal funding for expanded Medicaid coverage began to decrease in 2017. This reduction is causing states to re-evaluate funding for their Medicaidexpansions. That re-evalua
tion may adversely affect Medicaid payment rates, our Medicaid membership in those states, our revenues, our MLRs and ouroperating results.
•
If we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a CMS audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicablelaws and regulations, we could be subj
ect to fines, civil monetary penalties or other sanctions, including fines and penalties under the False Claims Act, whichcould have a materia
l adverse effect on our ability to participate in Medicare Advantage, Part D or other government programs, and on our operating results,cash flows and financial cond
ition.•
In the second quarter of 2014, CMS issued a final rule implementing ACA requirements that Medicare Advantage and PDP plans report and refund to CMSoverpayments that those pl
ans receive from CMS. However, CMS’s statements in formalized guidance regarding “overpayments” to Medicare Advantageplans appear to be inconsist
ent with CMS’s prior RADV audit guidance. These statements appear to equate each Medicare Advantage risk adjustment dataerror with an “overpaymen
t” without reconciliation to the principles underlying the fee for service adjustment comparison contemplated by CMS’s RADVaudit methodology. 
The precise interpretation, impact and legality of the final rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation. If Medicare Advantageplans were not paid based on paymen
t model principles that align with the requirements of the Social Security Act or such payments were not implementedcorrectly, it could hav
e a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.•
Certain of our Medicaid contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data. The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data isincreasingly importan
t to the success of our Medicaid programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performancestandards and, in part, to set p
remium rates. We have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collectaccurate, or to corr
ect inaccurate or incomplete, encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding, operating sanctions and financialfines and penalties for 
noncompliance. We have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providersand third-party vendors submi
tting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions. As states increasetheir reliance on encounter 
data, these difficulties could affect the Medicaid premium rates we receive and how Medicaid membership is assigned to us, whichcould have a materia
l adverse effect on our Medicaid operating results and cash flows and/or our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certainMedicaid programs.
•
Our businesses that dispense drugs also face challenges in the Medicaid space. The ACA made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and toreimbursement rat
es. One of these changes was to revise the definition of the Average Manufacturer Price, a pricing element common to most paymentformulas, and the reimbu
rsement formula for generic drugs. This change has adversely affected the reimbursements we receive when we dispense prescriptiondrugs to Medicaid recipi
ents.Programs funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government account for a signi
ficant portion of our revenues, and we expect that percentage toincrease.
Programs funded in whole or in part by 
the U.S. federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that percentage to increase. Asour government funded businesses grow, our 
exposure to changes in federal and state government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the variousgovernment funded programs in whi
ch we participate also increases.Our revenues from government 
funded programs, including in Health Care Benefits’ Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs planbusinesses and from government 
customers in its Commercial business, are dependent on annual funding by the federal government and/or applicable state or localgovernments. Federal, stat
e and local governments have the right to cancel or not to renew their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are notavailable. Funding for these p
rograms is dependent on many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts tocontain health care costs a
nd budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities.The U.S. federal government and our o
ther government customers also may reduce funding for health care or other programs, cancel or decline to renew contractswith us, or make changes that adv
ersely affect the number of persons eligible for certain programs, the services provided to enrollees in such programs, ourpremiums and our administ
rative and health care and other benefit costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results andcash flows. When federal fund
ing is delayed, suspended or curtailed, we continue to receive, and we remain liable for and are required to fund, claims fromproviders for providing servi
ces to beneficiaries of federally funded health benefits programs in which we participate. An extended federal government shutdownor a delay by Congress in raising th
e federal government’s debt ceiling49

also could lead to a delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and a significant increase in interest rates that could, in turn, havea material advers
e effect on the value of our investment portfolio, our ability to access the capital markets and our businesses, operating results, cash flows andliquidity.
Possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally can adv
ersely affect our PBM and Retail/LTC businesses.It is possible that the
 pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace AWP or Wholesale AcquisitionCost (“WAC”), which are the pric
ing references used for many of our PBM and LTC client contracts, drug purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialtypayor agreements and othe
r contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs have es
tablished pharmacy network payments on the basis of Actual Acquisition Cost (“AAC”). The use of an AAC basis in FFS Medicaid couldhave an impact on reimbu
rsement practices in Health Care Benefits’ Commercial and other Government products.Future changes to the use of AWP, WAC or to othe
r published pricing benchmarks used to establish drug pricing, including changes in the basis for calculatingreimbursement by federal and
 state health care programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs,the reimbursement we r
eceive from our PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with drug manufacturers, wholesalers,PBMs and retail pharmacies. A f
ailure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increasescould have a materia
l adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections.We cannot predict the 
effect of these possible changes on our businesses.We may not be able to obtain adequate prem
ium rate increases in our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which would have an adverse effect on ourrevenues, MBRs and operating results and could magnify the adverse impa
ct of increases in health care and other benefit costs and of ACA assessments, feesand taxes.
Premium rates for our Insu
red Health Care Benefits products generally must be filed with state insurance regulators and are subject to their approval, which createsrisk for us in the current po
litical and regulatory environment. The ACA generally requires a review by HHS in conjunction with state regulators of premium rateincreases that exce
ed a federally specified threshold (or lower state-specific thresholds set by states determined by HHS to have adequate processes). Rate reviewscan magnify the adverse 
impact on our operating margins, MBRs and operating results of increases in health care and other benefit costs, increased utilization ofcovered services, and ACA assessments, 
fees and taxes, by restricting our ability to reflect these increases and/or these assessments, fees and taxes in our pricing.Further, our ability to re
flect ACA assessments, fees and taxes in our Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP premium rates is limited.Since 2013, HHS has issued determinations to h
ealth plans that their premium rate increases were “unreasonable,” and we continue to experience challenges toappropriate premium rate increases
 in certain states. Regulators or legislatures in several states have implemented or are considering limits on premium rateincreases, either by en
forcing existing legal requirements more stringently or proposing different regulatory standards. Regulators or legislatures in several statesalso have conducted hearings on p
roposed premium rate increases, which can result, and in some instances have resulted, in substantial delays in implementingproposed rate increases 
even if they ultimately are approved. Our plans can be excluded from participating in small group Public Exchanges if they are deemed tohave a history of “unreasonab
le” rate increases. Any significant rate increases we may request heighten the risks of adverse publicity, adverse regulatory action andadverse selection and th
e likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied, reduced or delayed, which could adversely affect our MBRs and leadto operating margin comp
ression.We anticipate cont
inued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rates in our Insured Health Care Benefits products. We may not be ableto obtain rates that a
re actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policies profitable in one or more product lines or geographies. If we are unable toobtain adequate premium rates
 and/or premium rate increases, it could materially and adversely affect our operating margins and MBRs and our ability to earnadequate returns on Insured He
alth Care Benefits products in one or more states or cause us to withdraw from certain geographies and/or products.50

Minimum MLR rebate requirements limit the level of margin we can earn in our Insured Health Care Benefits products while leaving us exposed to higherthan expected medical costs. Challenges 
to our minimum MLR rebate methodology and/or reports could adversely affect our operating results.The ACA’s minimum MLR rebate requir
ements limit the level of margin we can earn in Health Care Benefits’ Commercial Insured and Medicare Insuredbusinesses. CMS minimum MLR rebate regu
lations limit the level of margin we can earn in our Medicaid Insured business. Certain portions of our Health CareBenefits Medicaid and Feder
al Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) program business also are subject to minimum MLR rebate requirements in addition to butseparate from those i
mposed by the ACA. Minimum MLR rebate requirements leave us exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in our pricing.The process supporting the manag
ement and determination of the amount of MLR rebates payable is complex and requires judgment, and the minimum MLRreporting requiremen
ts are detailed. CMS has also proposed, but not yet finalized, a definition of “prescription drug price concessions” for commercial MLRcalculation purposes, which would m
ake additional PBM information available to plans and the HHS, potentially further complicating the MLR calculationprocess. Federal and state 
auditors are challenging our Commercial Health Care Benefits business’ compliance with the ACA’s minimum MLR requirements aswell as our FEHB plans’ compliance with OPM’s FEHB program
-specific minimum MLR requirements. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also are subject tominimum MLR audits. If a Medi
care Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible toenroll new members. If a M
edicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. Additionalchallenges to our metho
dology and/or reports relating to minimum MLR and related rebates by federal and state regulators and private litigants are reasonablypossible. The outcome of these 
audits and additional challenges could adversely affect our operating results.Our operating results may be adversely aff
ected by changes in laws and policies governing employers and by union organizing activity.The federal and cert
ain state legislatures continue to consider and pass legislation that increases our costs of doing business, including increased minimum wagesand requiring employers to p
rovide paid sick leave or paid family leave. In addition, our employee-related operating costs may be increased by union organizingactivity. If we are unab
le to reflect these increased expenses in our pricing or otherwise modify our operations to mitigate the effects of such increases, ouroperating results will be 
adversely affected.We face international politica
l, legal and compliance, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that may be more significant than in our domesticoperations.
We significantly expand
ed our international operations as a result of the Aetna Acquisition. As a result of our expanded international operations, we face political,legal, compliance, ope
rational, regulatory, economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operations. These risksvary widely by country and include v
arying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands, government intervention and censorship, discriminatoryregulation, nationalization 
or expropriation of assets and pricing constraints. Our international products need to meet country-specific customer and memberpreferences as well as 
country-specific legal requirements, including those related to licensing, data privacy, data storage and data protection.Our international opera
tions increase our exposure to, and require us to devote significant management resources to implement controls and systems to complywith, the privacy and data pro
tection laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as the EU’s GDPR, and the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering lawsof the United States (includ
ing the FCPA) and the United Kingdom (including the UK Bribery Act) and similar laws in other jurisdictions. Implementing ourcompliance policies, 
internal controls and other systems upon our expansion into new countries and geographies may require the investment of considerablemanagement time and financial an
d other resources over several years before any significant revenues or profits are generated. Violations of these laws andregulations could result 
in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business, andsignificant brand and repu
tational harm. We must regularly reassess the size, capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, andmust have effective 
change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our businesses and operations. Our success depends, in part,on our ability to anticip
ate these risks and manage these difficulties, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our brand, reputation,businesses, operating results 
and/or financial condition.Our international opera
tions require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages, cultures, legal and regulatory schemes and timezones. Our international ope
rations encounter labor laws, standards and customs that can be difficult and make employee relationships less flexible than in ourdomestic operations and exp
ensive to modify or terminate. In51

some countries we are required to, or choose to, operate with local business associates, which requires us to manage our relationships with these third parties andmay reduce our operation
al flexibility and ability to quickly respond to business challenges.In some countries we may be expos
ed to currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds internationally or converting localcurrencies into U.S. dollars or o
ther currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues, operating results and cash flowsfrom our internationa
l operations. Some of our operations are, and are increasingly likely to be, in emerging markets where these risks are heightened. Anymeasures we may implement t
o reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks on our international operations may not be effective.Risks Associated with Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures
We may be unable to successfully integra
te companies we acquire.Upon the closing of any acquisition we 
complete, we will need to successfully integrate the products, services and related assets, as well as internal controls intoour business operations. If an a
cquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, its products, services and related assets into our company alsomay be complex and time
-consuming and, if the integration is not fully successful, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies and/orgrowth opportunities of an acquis
ition. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:•
Integrating personnel, operations and systems (including internal control environments and compliance policies), while maintaining focus on producing anddelivering consistent, high qu
ality products and services;•
Coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;•
Disrupting management’s attention from our ongoing business operations;•
Retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; and•
Managing inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations.An inability to realiz
e the full extent of the anticipated benefits, operating and cost synergies, innovations and operations efficiencies or growth opportunities of anacquisition, as well as any de
lays or additional expenses encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses andoperating results. Further
more, acquisitions, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increasedcompetition or chall
enges with respect to our products, services or service areas, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired businessincluding risks and liabil
ities associated with litigation involving the acquired business. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize anybenefit from our acquis
itions after we have expended resources on them.We expect to continue to pursue acquisitions, joint 
ventures, strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities, which may be unsuccessful, cause usto assume unanticipated liabiliti
es, disrupt our existing businesses, be dilutive or lead us to assume significant debt, among other things.We expect to continue to pu
rsue acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances and other inorganic growth opportunities as part of our growth strategy. In additionto the integration risks no
ted above, some other risks we face with respect to acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies include:•
we frequently compete with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources and a greater tolerance for risk, to acquire attractivecompanies;
•
the acquired, alliance and/or joint venture businesses may not perform as projected;•
the goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of our acquisitions may be incorrectly valued or may become impaired; for example, in 2018 wetook $6.1 billion of goodwill impai
rment charges related to our LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment;•
we may assume unanticipated liabilities, including those that were not disclosed to us or which we underestimated;•
the acquired businesses, or the pursuit of other inorganic growth strategies, could disrupt or compete with our existing businesses, distract management, resultin the loss of key employees, div
ert resources, result in tax costs or inefficiencies and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls,information technology syst
ems, policies, procedures and performance;52

•as we did in the Aetna Acquisition, we may finance future acquisitions and other inorganic growth strategies by issuing common stock for some or all of thepurchase price, which would dilut
e the ownership interests of our stockholders;•
as we did in the Aetna Acquisition, we may incur significant debt in connection with acquisitions (whether to finance acquisitions or by assuming debt fromthe businesses we acquire);
•
we may not have the expertise to manage and profitably grow the businesses we acquire, and we may need to rely on the retention of key personnel and othersuppliers of businesses we acquir
e, which may be difficult or impossible to accomplish;•
we may enter into merger or purchase agreements but, due to reasons within or outside our control, fail to complete the related transactions, which could resultin termination fees o
r other penalties that could be material, cause material disruptions to our businesses and operations and adversely affect our brand andreputation;
•
in order to complete a proposed acquisition, we may be required to divest certain portions of our business, for which we may not be able to obtain favorablepricing;
•
as is the case with the Aetna Acquisition and our acquisition of Omnicare, Inc., we may be involved in litigation related to mergers or acquisitions, includingfor matters that oc
curred prior to the applicable closing, which may be costly to defend and may result in adverse rulings against us that could be material; and•
the integration into our businesses of the businesses and entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and regulations apply to us, includingsubjecting us to laws and regula
tions that did not previously apply to us.In addition, joint ventures p
resent risks that are different from acquisitions, including selection of appropriate joint venture parties, initial and ongoing governanceof the joint venture, join
t venture compliance activities (including compliance with applicable CMS requirements), growing the joint venture’s business in amanner acceptable 
to all the parties, including other providers in the networks that include joint ventures, maintaining positive relationships among the jointventure parties and the 
joint venture’s customers, and member and business disruption that may occur upon joint venture termination.Risks Related to Our Operations
Failure to meet customer expec
tations may harm our brand and reputation, our ability to retain and grow our customer base and membership and ouroperating results and cash flows.
Our ability to attract and
 retain customers and members is dependent upon providing cost effective, quality customer service operations (such as call centeroperations, PBM functions, retai
l pharmacy and LTC services, retail, mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription delivery, claims processing, customer caseinstallation and online 
access and tools) that meet or exceed our customers’ and members’ expectations, either directly or through vendors. As we seek to reducegeneral and administr
ative expenses, we must balance the potential impact of cost-saving measures on our customers and other services and performances. If wemisjudge the effects of s
uch measures, customers and other services may be adversely affected. We depend on third parties for certain of our customer service,PBM and prescription delivery ope
rations. If we or our vendors fail to provide service that meets our customers’ and members’ expectations, we may havedifficulty retain
ing or profitably growing our customer base and/or membership, which could adversely affect our operating results. For example, noncompliancewith any privacy or security 
laws or regulations or any security breach involving us or one of our third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on ourbusinesses, operating results, b
rand and reputation.We and our vendors have experienced and continue to experience 
cyber attacks. We can provide no assurance that we or our vendors will be able to detect,prevent or contain the effects of such at
tacks or other information security (including cybersecurity) risks or threats in the future.We and our vendors have experi
enced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. As examples, the Company and itsvendors have experienced a
ttempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanning activity, andphishing emails. Attacks can o
riginate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states, or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicatesignificant resources 
and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate theinformation security 
risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorizedparties to obtain acc
ess to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service, or cause other damage. The impact of cyber attacks has not been material to theCompany’s operations or operat
ing results through December 31, 2020. The Board and its Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate GovernanceCommittee are regularly informed
 regarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status.53

A compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed,obtained, damaged, or used by unautho
rized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers andclients, financial 
institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financialcondition. Because the techn
iques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediatelyproduce signs of intrusion, we may be un
able to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Moreover, a data security breachcould require that we expend s
ignificant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnelfrom performing thei
r primary operational duties. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with,including key payors and vendors.
The costs of attempting to p
rotect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to a cyber-incident are significant. Large scale data breaches at otherentities increase 
the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of ourcustomers’, members’ 
and other constituents’ sensitive information. Following a cyber-incident, our and/or our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful,and a cyber-incident cou
ld result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers and members. In addition, breaches ofour and/or our vendors’ securi
ty measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidentialinformation about us, our custo
mers, our members or other third-parties, could expose our customers’, members’ and other constituents’ private information andour customers, members and o
ther constituents to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of thisinformation, and result 
in investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, loss of customers, litigation or other actions which couldhave a material adv
erse effect on our brand, reputation, businesses, operating results and cash flows.Data governance failures can adversely aff
ect our reputation, businesses and prospects. Our use and disclosure of members’, customers’ and otherconstituents’ sensitive informat
ion is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels. We would be adversely affected if we or our business associates or othervendors fail to adequately protec
t members’, customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information.Our information systems ar
e critical to the operation of our businesses. We collect, process, maintain, retain, evaluate, utilize and distribute large amounts ofpersonal health and finan
cial information and other confidential and sensitive data about our customers, members and other constituents in the ordinary course ofour businesses. Some of our informa
tion systems rely upon third party systems, including cloud service providers, to accomplish these tasks. The use anddisclosure of such informa
tion is regulated at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change and increasedenforcement activ
ity, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which went into effect January 1, 2020, the EU’s GDPR which began to apply across the EUduring 2018 and the audit program 
implemented by HHS under HIPAA. In some cases, such laws, rules and regulations also apply to our vendors and/or may holdus liable for any violat
ions by our vendors. International laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally morestringent than U.S. laws and regulat
ions, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations, or anysecurity breach, cyber 
attack or cybersecurity breach, and any incident involving the theft, misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to,sensitive or confidenti
al customer, member or other constituent information, whether by us, by one of our business associates or vendors or by another third party,could require us to expend signi
ficant resources to remediate any damage, could interrupt our operations and could adversely affect our brand and reputation,membership and operating 
results and also could expose and/or has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation (including class action litigation),governmental investigation
s and enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutorydamages, consent orders, adve
rse actions against our licenses to do business and/or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows or financ
ial condition.Our businesses depend on our customers’, 
members’ and other constituents’ willingness to entrust us with their health related and other sensitive personalinformation. Events that 
adversely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our members or customers of our uses of their information, failing to keepour information technology sys
tems and our customers’, members’ and other constituents’ sensitive information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, lossor unauthorized disclosure o
r access, whether as a result of our action or inaction (including human error) or that of our business associates, vendors or other thirdparties, could adversely 
affect our brand and reputation, membership and operating results and also could expose and/or has exposed us to mandatory disclosure tothe media, litigation (includi
ng class action litigation), governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediationcosts, and compensatory, speci
al, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and/or injunctive relief, any ofwhich
54

could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we andour vendors face in maint
aining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’, members’ and otherconstituents’ sensitive 
information. There can be no assurance that additional such failures will not occur, or if any do occur, that we will detect them or that theycan be sufficiently remediated.
Product liability, product recal
l or personal injury issues could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows and/or financial condition.
The products that we sell could b
ecome subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling, recall or other damage. In addition, errors in the dispensing andpackaging of drugs and consuming drugs in 
a manner that is not prescribed could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may beasserted against us with resp
ect to any of the drugs or other products we sell or services we provide. For example, we are a defendant in hundreds of litigationproceedings relating to op
ioids and the sale of products containing talc. Our businesses involve the provision of professional services, including by pharmacists,physician assistants, nurses and nu
rse practitioners, which exposes us to professional liability claims. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverageavailable under our insur
ance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us from third parties may not be adequate to protect us against the financialimpact of the rela
ted claims. We also may not be able to maintain our existing levels of insurance on acceptable terms in the future. A product liability or personalinjury issue or judgment aga
inst us or a product recall could damage our reputation and have a significant adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and/orfinancial condition.
We face significant compet
ition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical toour success, and our failure to do so could adversely affe
ct our businesses, operating results and/or future performance.Our ability to attrac
t and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives. There is no guarantee we willbe able to attract 
and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased compensation and/or benefits costs. If weare unable to retain 
existing employees or attract additional employees, or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership, we could experience a material adverseeffect on our businesses, oper
ating results and/or future performance.In addition, our failure 
to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfullytransition into new roles cou
ld have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and/or future performance. The succession plans we have in placeand our employment arrang
ements with certain key executives do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us.Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability 
to attract and motivate internal sales personnel and independent third-party brokers,consultants and agents. New distribution channels create new disintermedia
tion risk. We may be subject to penalties or other regulatory actions as a result ofthe marketing practices of brokers and agents se
lling our products.Our products are sold primar
ily through our sales personnel, who frequently work with independent brokers, consultants and agents who assist in the productionand servicing of business. The indep
endent brokers, consultants and agents generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may frequently recommend and/ormarket health car
e benefits products of our competitors. Accordingly, we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance. Our sales could be adverselyaffected if we are un
able to attract, retain or motivate sales personnel and third-party brokers, consultants and agents, or if we do not adequately provide support,training and education to 
this sales network regarding our complex product portfolio, or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distributionchannels. This risk is heighten
ed as we develop, operate and expand our consumer-oriented products and services and we expand in the health care space and ourbusiness model evolves to includ
e a greater focus on consumers and direct-to-consumer sales, such as competing for sales on Insurance Exchanges.New distribution channels for our p
roducts and services continue to emerge, including Private Exchanges operated by health care consultants and technologycompanies. These chan
nels may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers and other customers in the selection and management of their healthcare benefits, in health care 
utilization and in the effective navigation of the health care system. We also may be challenged by new technologies and marketplaceentrants that could int
erfere with our existing relationships with customers and health plan members in these areas.55

In addition, there have been several investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care and other insurance products and thepayments they receive. Th
ese investigations have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and sellingthose companies’ products. For ex
ample, CMS and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agentswho market Medicare produc
ts. These investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and/or changesto industry practices, which 
could adversely affect our ability to market our products.Failure of our businesses to effective
ly collaborate could prevent us from maximizing our operating results.To maximize our overal
l enterprise value, our various businesses need to collaborate effectively. Our businesses need to be aligned in order to prioritize goals andcoordinate the design of new produ
cts intended to utilize the offerings of multiple businesses, including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs.In addition, misaligned in
centives, information siloes, ineffective product development and failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures, for examplesignificant financi
al decisions being made at an inappropriate level in our organization, also could prevent us from maximizing our operating results and/orachieving our financia
l and other projections.The failure or disruption of our information technology syst
ems or the failure of our information technology infrastructure to support our businesses couldadversely affect our reputation, businesses, op
erating results and cash flows.Our information system
s are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses,security breaches (includin
g credit card or personally identifiable information breaches), cyber attacks, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. If ourinformation systems ar
e damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and mayexperience reputational damage,
 loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions andimplement new and innovativ
e services. In addition, compliance with changes in U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including privacy and information securitylaws and standards, may cause us to 
incur significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.Our business success and operating results depend in part on effectiv
e information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implementimprovements in technology. Pursuing multiple 
initiatives simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly morechallenging.
Many aspects of our operations 
are dependent on our information systems and the information collected, processed, stored, and handled by these systems. We relyheavily on our computer syste
ms to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, claims processing, customerloyalty and subscription progr
ams, finance and other processes. Throughout our operations, we collect, process, maintain, retain, evaluate, utilize and distributelarge amounts of confide
ntial and sensitive data and information, including personally identifiable information and protected health information, that ourcustomers, members and oth
er constituents provide to purchase products or services, enroll in programs or services, register on our websites, interact with ourpersonnel, or otherwise commun
icate with us. In addition, for these operations, we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information overpublic networks.
We have many differen
t information and other technology systems supporting our businesses (including as a result of our acquisitions). Our businesses depend inlarge part on these syste
ms to adequately price our products and services; accurately establish reserves, process claims and report operating results; and interactwith providers, employer plan sponso
rs, customers, members, consumers and vendors in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion. In addition, recent trends towardgreater consumer engag
ement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Certain of ourtechnology systems (including so
ftware) are older, legacy systems that are less flexible, less efficient and require a significant ongoing commitment of capital andhuman resources to maint
ain, protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other systems. We must re-engineer and reduce the number of these systemsto meet changing consumer 
and vendor preferences and needs, improve our productivity and reduce our operating expenses. We also need to develop or acquirenew technology systems, contrac
t with new vendors or modify certain of our existing systems to support the consumer-oriented and transformation products andservices we are developing, op
erating and expanding and/or to meet current and developing industry and regulatory standards, including to keep pace withcontinuing changes in inform
ation processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risks and threats. If we fail to achieve these objectives, our ability toprofitably grow our business and/or ou
r operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, information 
technology and other technology and process improvement projects, including our transformation and enterprise modernization programs,frequently are long-t
erm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we56

expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete. If we do not effectively and efficiently secure, manage, integrate and enhance ourtechnology portfolio (inc
luding vendor sourced systems), we could, among other things, have problems determining health care and other benefit cost estimatesand/or establishing appropr
iate pricing, meeting the needs of customers, consumers, providers, members and vendors, developing and expanding our consumer-oriented products and servi
ces or keeping pace with industry and regulatory standards, and our operating results may be adversely affected.We are subject to payment-rela
ted risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and disrupt ourbusiness operations.
We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, mobile payments and potentially other technologies inthe future. Acceptance o
f these payment methods subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including paymentnetwork rules and operating guid
elines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirementsmay change in the future, whi
ch could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment options, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchangeand other fees, which could inc
rease periodically thereby raising our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including theprocessing of credit ca
rds, debit cards, and various other forms of electronic payment. If these vendors are unable to provide these services to us, or if their systemsare compromised, our oper
ations could be disrupted. The payment methods that we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft by persons seeking to obtainunauthorized access to, or 
exploit any weaknesses in, the payment systems we use. If we fail to abide by applicable rules or requirements, or if data relating to ourpayment systems is comprom
ised due to a breach or misuse, we may be responsible for any costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties orsubject to fines and higher 
transaction fees. In addition, our reputation and ability to accept certain types of payments could each be harmed resulting in reducedsales and adverse effe
cts on our operating results.Both our and our vendors’ operations are subject to a variety of business cont
inuity hazards and risks, any of which could interrupt our operations orotherwise adversely affect our per
formance and operating results.We and our vendors are subjec
t to business continuity hazards and other risks, including natural disasters, utility and other mechanical failures, acts of war orterrorism, acts of c
ivil unrest, disruption of communications, data security and preservation, disruption of supply or distribution, safety regulation and labordifficulties. The occu
rrence of any of these or other events to us or our vendors might disrupt or shut down our operations or otherwise adversely affect ouroperations. We also may be sub
ject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life, or damage to property, resulting from such events. Althoughwe have developed procedures fo
r crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe arecustomary and adequate fo
r our size and industry, our insurance policies include limits and exclusions and, as a result, our coverage may be insufficient to protectagainst all potentia
l hazards and risks incident to our businesses. In addition, our crisis management and disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plansmay not be effective. Should 
any such hazards or risks occur, or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable, our businesses, operating results, cashflows and financial condit
ion could be adversely affected.Financial Risks
We would be adversely affected 
if we do not effectively deploy our capital.  Downgrades or potential downgrades in our credit ratings, should they occur, couldadversely affect our brand and reputation, businesses, operat
ing results, cash flows and financial condition.Our operations generate sign
ificant capital, and we have the ability to raise additional capital. The manner in which we deploy our capital, including investments inour businesses, our operations (such 
as information technology and other strategic and capital projects), dividends, acquisitions, share and/or debt repurchases,repayment of debt, reins
urance or other capital uses, impacts our financial strength, claims paying ability and credit ratings issued by nationally-recognizedstatistical rat
ing organizations. Credit ratings issued by nationally-recognized statistical rating organizations are broadly distributed and generally used throughoutour industries. Our ratings re
flect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations orobligations to our insureds. We b
elieve our credit ratings and the financial strength and claims paying ability of our principal insurance and HMO subsidiaries areimportant factors in 
marketing our Health Care Benefits products to certain of our customers.Each of the ratings organi
zations reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future. Inconnection with the comple
tion of the Aetna Acquisition, each of Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and57

Fitch downgraded certain of our debt, financial strength and/or other credit ratings. Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, operatingresults, cash flows and financ
ial condition.Goodwill and other intangible assets could, in the future, becom
e impaired.As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $110.7 b
illion and $112.9 billion, respectively, of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill andindefinitely-lived intangible a
ssets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying valuemay not be recoverable. 
When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts.We estimate the f
air value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of areporting unit exceeds i
ts estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance.Estimated fair valu
es could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment,adverse legal or regul
atory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows ormarket capitalization. Because 
of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncashcharges to our operating r
esults, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Adverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can signi
ficantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities,mortgage loans, alternative invest
ments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.The global capital ma
rkets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfoliothat supports our policy liab
ilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from ourinvestment portfolio is 
largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser extent the international financial markets; and volatility, uncertaintyand/or disruptions in the globa
l capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments’ monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, cansignificantly and advers
ely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:•
significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce ouroperating results and/or un
realized capital losses that reduce our shareholders’ equity;•
keeping interest rates low on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities (such as we have experienced during recent years) and thereby materiallyreducing our net investmen
t income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed ofcontinue to be reinvested 
in lower yielding securities;•
reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;•
causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio,mortgage borrowers and/or r
einsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;•
making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for example if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estim
ates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-to-period volatility in our net income and shareholders’ equity;•
reducing our ability to issue short-term debt securities at attractive interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and decreasing our operating results;and
•
reducing our ability to issue other securities.Although we seek, within guidelines we dee
m appropriate, to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures, afailure adequately 
to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and, in extreme circumstances, our cash flows.We have incurred and assumed significant indebtedness which has increased our consolida
ted interest expense and could adversely affect our businessflexibility and increase our borrowing costs.
In order to complete th
e Aetna Acquisition, we incurred acquisition-related debt financing of approximately $45.0 billion and assumed Aetna’s existingindebtedness with a fair va
lue of approximately $8.1 billion. Our substantial indebtedness and elevated debt-to-equity ratio have the effect, among other things, ofreducing our flexibili
ty to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense compared to pre-Aetna Acquisition periods.In addition, the amount of
58

cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources are greater than the amount of cash flows required to serviceour indebtedness prior to the Ae
tna Acquisition. We have suspended share repurchases until we reach our desired debt-to-equity ratio. The increased levels ofindebtedness also could reduc
e funds available to engage in investments in product development, capital expenditures, dividend payments and other activities andmay create compet
itive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels.Risks Related to Our Relationships with Manufacturers, Providers, Suppliers and Vendors
We face risks relating to the marke
t availability, pricing, suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs and other products that we purchase and sell.Our Retail/LTC segment and our ma
il order and specialty pharmacy operations generate revenues in significant part by dispensing prescription drugs. Our PBMbusiness generates revenues p
rimarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. As a result, we aredependent on our relationships wi
th prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers. We acquire a substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacies’prescription drug supply from 
a limited number of suppliers. Certain of our agreements with such suppliers are short-term and cancelable by either party withoutcause. In addition, these ag
reements may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than us. Certain of these agreements also allow pricing and otherterms to be adjusted per
iodically for changing market conditions or required service levels. A termination or modification to any of these relationships couldadversely affect our p
rescription drug supply and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, manyproducts distributed by our phar
macies are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. In some cases, we depend upon a single sourceof supply. Any such supply shortages or loss of any such s
ingle source of supply could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Much of the branded and generi
c drug product that we sell in our pharmacies, and much of the other merchandise we sell, is manufactured in whole or insubstantial part outside o
f the United States. In most cases, the products or merchandise are imported by others and sold to us. As a result, significant changes in taxor trade policies, ta
riffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, couldresult in significant 
increases in our costs, restrict our access to suppliers, depress economic activity, and have a material adverse effect on our businesses,operating results and cash 
flows. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies and such changes, as well as any negative sentimentstowards the United States in respons
e to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade regulations, could adversely affect our businesses.Our suppliers are independent 
entities subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside our control. If our current suppliers were to stop sellingprescription drugs to us or del
ay delivery, including as a result of supply shortages, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptciesof our suppliers, or for other 
reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or atall.
Our operating results may be adversely aff
ected if we are unable to contract with providers on competitive terms and develop and maintain attractive networkswith high quality providers.
We are seeking to enhanc
e our health care provider networks by entering into joint ventures and other collaborative risk-sharing arrangements with providers.Providers’ willingness to ente
r these arrangements with us depends upon, among other things, our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data tosupport these value-based con
tracts. These arrangements are designed to give providers incentives to engage in population health management and optimizedelivery of health ca
re to our members. These arrangements also may allow us to expand into new geographies, target new customer groups, increase membershipand reduce medical cos
ts and, if we provide technology or other services to the relevant health system or provider organization, may contribute to our revenue andearnings from altern
ative sources. If such arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract providers to sucharrangements, or are 
less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors, our medical costs may not be competitive and may be higher than weproject, our attrac
tiveness to customers may be reduced, we may lose or be unable to grow medical membership, and our ability to profitably grow our businessand/or our operating resul
ts may be adversely affected.While we believe joint ve
ntures, accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) and other non-traditional health care provider organizational structures presentopportunities for us, the imp
lementation of our joint ventures and other non-traditional structure strategies may not achieve the intended results, which couldadversely affect our op
erating results and cash flows. Among other things, joint ventures require us to maintain collaborative relationships with our counterparties,continue to gain access to p
rovider rates that make the joint ventures economically sustainable and devote significant management time to the59

operation and management of the joint ventures. We may not be able to achieve these objectives in one or more of our joint ventures, which could adversely affectour operating results and c
ash flows.If our service providers fail to 
meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be exposed to brand andreputational harm, litigation and/or regulatory ac
tion. This risk is particularly high in our Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needsplan programs.
We contract with various 
third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems. Our arrangementswith these third parties 
may expose us to public scrutiny, adversely affect our brand and reputation, expose us to litigation or regulatory action, and otherwise makeour operations vulnera
ble if we fail to adequately oversee, monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or tocomply with applicable l
aws or regulations. For example, certain of our vendors have been responsible for releases of sensitive information of our members andemployees, which has caused us to in
cur additional expenses and given rise to regulatory actions and litigation against us.These risks are particularly
 high in our Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs, where third parties perform medicalmanagement and other member relate
d services for us. Any failure of our or these third parties’ prevention, detection or control systems related to regulatorycompliance, complian
ce with our internal policies, data security and/or cybersecurity or any incident involving the theft, misappropriation, loss or otherunauthorized disclosure of, o
r access to, members’, customers’ or other constituents’ sensitive information could require us to expend significant resources toremediate any damag
e, interrupt our operations and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose us to whistleblower, class action and other litigation,other proceedings, prohibit
ions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members, corrective actions, fines, sanctions and/or penalties, any of which couldadversely affect our bus
inesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.We may experience increased m
edical and other benefit costs, litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when providers that do not havecontracts with us render services to our Health Care Benef
its members.Some providers that render s
ervices to our Health Care Benefits members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-establishedunderstanding with these provide
rs as to the amount of compensation that is due to them for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount ofcompensation due to these nonpa
rticipating providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standardthat is not clearly translatable
 into dollar terms. In such instances providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitratetheir dispute with us or try to 
recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us from our members, which may result incustomer and member diss
atisfaction. For example, in October 2018, an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospitals approximately $150 million in a proceedingrelating to Aetna’s out-o
f-network benefit payment and administration practices, and in March 2019 that award was reduced to approximately $86 million. Suchdisputes may cause us to pay highe
r medical or other benefit costs than we projected.Continuing consolidation and integration among providers and other suppliers may increas
e our medical and other covered benefits costs, make it difficult forus to compete in certain geographies and creat
e new competitors.Hospitals and other providers and h
ealth systems continue to consolidate across the health care industry. While this consolidation could increase efficiency and hasthe potential to improve t
he delivery of health care services, it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting parties in certain geographies.These health systems also a
re increasingly forming and considering forming health plans to directly offer health insurance in competition with us, a process thathas been accelerat
ed by the ACA. In addition, ACOs (including Commercial and Medicaid-only ACOs developed as a result of state Medicaid laws), practicemanagement companies, 
consolidation among and by integrated health systems and other changes in the organizational structures that physicians, hospitals andother providers adopt continu
es to change the way these providers interact with us and the competitive landscape in which we operate. These changes may increaseour medical and other cov
ered benefits costs, may affect the way we price our products and services and estimate our medical and other covered benefits costs andmay require us to change our op
erations, including by withdrawing from certain geographies where we do not have a significant presence across our businesses orare unable to collabor
ate or contract with providers on acceptable terms. Each of these changes may adversely affect our businesses and operating results.60

Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (“MD&A”)
The following discussion and analysis should be read 
in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this10-K, “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10
-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K.Overview of Business
CVS Health Corporation (“CVS Health”), togethe
r with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is a diversified health servicescompany united around a common pu
rpose of helping people on their path to better health. In an increasingly connected and digital world, we are meeting peoplewherever they are and chang
ing health care to meet their needs. The Company has more than 9,900 retail locations, approximately 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, aleading pharmacy benef
its manager with approximately 105 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one millionpatients per year and exp
anding specialty pharmacy services. We also serve an estimated 34 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directedhealth insurance products 
and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan(“PDP”). The Company believes its innova
tive health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health carecosts.
On November 28, 2018 (the “Aetna Acquisition Da
te”), the Company acquired Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”). As a result of the acquisition of Aetna (the “AetnaAcquisition”), the Company added th
e Health Care Benefits segment. Certain aspects of Aetna’s operations, including products for which the Company no longersolicits or accepts new cus
tomers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products, are included in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment. Theconsolidated financia
l statements reflect Aetna’s results subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Date.The Company has four reportable s
egments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC, Health Care Benefits and Corporate/Other, which are described below.Overview of the Pharmacy Services Seg
mentThe Pharmacy Services segmen
t provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration,formulary management, retail pharmac
y network management services, mail order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, diseasemanagement services 
and medical spend management. The Pharmacy Services segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions,government employee groups, he
alth plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on public health insurance exchanges and private health insuranceexchanges and other sponsors of hea
lth benefit plans throughout the United States. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores,specialty mail orde
r pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.Overview of the Retail/LTC Segment
The Retail/LTC segment sells p
rescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care servicesthrough its MinuteClinic
 walk-in medical clin ics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 andshingles and conducts long-ter
m care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and otherancillary services 
to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2020, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations,approximately 1,100 MinuteClin
ic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. For the year ended December 31,2020, the Company dispensed approximat
ely 27.1% of the total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the United States.Overview of the Health Care Benefi
ts SegmentThe Health Care Benefits segm
ent is one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the informationand resources to help memb
ers, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health CareBenefits segment offers 
a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy,dental and behavioral he
alth plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health caremanagement services 
and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits®66

segment also provided workers’ compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers’ Compensation business (“Workers’Compensation business”) prior to 
the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment’s customers include employer groups, individuals,college students, part-
time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groupsand expatriates. The Company r
efers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” andadministrative serv
ices contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” For periodsprior to the Aetna Acquisition Da
te, the Health Care Benefits segment was comprised only of the Company’s SilverScript PDP business. Overview of the Corporate/Other Seg
mentThe Company presents the rema
inder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•
Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and thecorporate relations, 
legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’sinvestments in its transf
ormation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; and•
Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.®67

COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic has severely imp
acted the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. Beginning in March 2020, the effects of theCOVID-19 pandemic began to emerge in 
the U.S. The Company executed preparedness plans to maintain continuity of its operations, including transitioning manyoffice-based colle
agues to a remote work environment and installing protective equipment in our retail pharmacies. The Company also provided enhanced benefitsto its colleagues, inclu
ding bonuses to frontline colleagues, dependent care financial assistance, paid sick leave for part-time colleagues and paid time off tocolleagues who test positive o
r are quarantined due to exposure to COVID-19. Our strong local presence and scale in communities across the country enabled us toplay an indispensable role 
in the national response to COVID-19, as well as provide seamless support for our customers wherever they needed us: in our CVSlocations, in their homes, 
and virtually. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Company’s operating results for the year ended December 31,2020, primarily in the Company’s He
alth Care Benefits and Retail/LTC segments.Health Care Benefits Segment
Beginning in mid-Marc
h, the health system experienced a significant reduction in utilization of medical services (“utilization”) that is discretionary and thecancellation of el
ective medical procedures. Utilization remained below historical levels through April, began to recover in May and June and reached more normallevels in the third and fou
rth quarters, with select geographies impacted by COVID-19 waves.In response to COVID-19, the Company expanded benef
it coverage to its members. These expanded benefits included cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 relatedtreatments, as well as 
assistance to members through premium credits, telehealth cost-sharing waivers and other investments.COVID-19 also resulted in a shift in th
e Company’s medical membership during the year. The Company experienced declines in Commercial membership due toreductions in workforce at ou
r existing customers, substantially offset by increases in Medicaid membership primarily as a result of the suspension of eligibilityredeterminations and 
increased unemployment.Retail/LTC Segment
During March 2020, the Company experien
ced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills of maintenancemedications, as well as in
creased front store volume as consumers prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the second quarter and continuingthroughout the remainder
 of the year, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-placeorders as well as reduced new th
erapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, theCompany incurred incremen
tal operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees associated withprescription home deliv
ery and associated front store products.During 2020, the Company also played a key ro
le in supporting the local communities in which it operates. The Company offered COVID-19 diagnostic testing atmore than 4,000 CVS Pharmacy locations as o
f December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company launched critical diagnostic testing for the vulnerable seniorpopulation in long-term c
are facilities in partnership with three states. The Company was also selected to administer COVID-19 vaccines in both long-term carefacilities and its retail pharmacies.
 The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccinations in long-term care facilities and in certain of its retail pharmaciesduring December 2020 and February 2021, r
espectively, and expects to play a significant role in COVID-19 vaccine administration in the future.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. 
We believe COVID-19’s impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial conditionprimarily will be driv
en by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies andconsumer behavior and
 health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and localgovernmental responses to th
e pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on ourbusinesses, operating results, 
cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.68

Revenues
•
Total revenues increased $11.9 billion or 4.6% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by growth in the Health CareBenefits and Retail/LTC segmen
ts.•
Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the revenues of the Company’s segments.Operating expenses
•
Operating expenses increased $1.6 billion or 4.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at13.1% in both 2020 and 2019. The increase in op
erating expenses was primarily due to the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurer fee (“HIF”)which was $1.0 billion for 2020, increm
ental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and increasedoperating expenses associa
ted with growth in the business. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by (i) a $269 million pre-tax gain on the saleof the Workers’ Compensation bus
iness, which occurred on July 31, 2020, (ii) the absence of $231 million of store rationalization charges and a $205 millionpre-tax loss on the sale of 
the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Drogaria69

Onofre Ltda. (“Onofre”), both recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019, and (iii) the favorable impact of enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives in 2020.•
Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating expenses of the Company’s segments.Operating income
•
Operating income increased $1.9 billion or 16.1% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to:•
Increased operating income in the Health Care Benefits segment, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, pre-tax income of $307 millionassociated with the rec
eipt of amounts owed to the Company under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care andEducation Reconciliation Ac
t of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment wasuncertain, and the $269 mil
lion pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business;•
Increased operating income in the Pharmacy Services segment, primarily related to improved purchasing economics; and•
The favorable impact of enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives in 2020, partially offset by:•
Decreased operating income in the Retail/LTC segment, primarily as a result of continued reimbursement pressure and the net adverse impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic, partially offs
et by the absence of $231 million of store rationalization charges and the $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale ofOnofre, both recorded in 2019.
•
Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating income of the Company’s segments.Interest expense
•
Interest expense decreased $128 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average debt in 2020. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” laterin this report for addit
ional information.Loss on early extinguishment of debt
•
During 2020, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of $6.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tenderoffers for such senior notes 
in August 2020, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $766 million, and the repayment of $4.5 billion of itsoutstanding senior notes pursuant 
to its tender offers for such senior notes in December 2020, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of$674 million. During 2019, the loss on ear
ly extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of $4.0 billion of its outstanding senior notespursuant to its tender off
ers for such senior notes in August 2019, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $79 million. See Note 8‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements
’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Other income
•
Other income increased $82 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Other income represents pension plan asset returns in excess of interest cost on pension planobligations. The increase 
in other income in 2020 was primarily due to lower discount rates in 2020 compared to 2019 when determining the interest cost onthe Company’s pension plan obligat
ions as well as strong plan asset returns.Income tax provision
•
The Company’s effective income tax rate remained consistent at 26.3% in both 2020 and 2019, with the impact of the non-deductible HIF offset by thefavorable resolution of 
certain tax matters in the year ended December 31, 2020.Loss from discontinued operations
•
In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1995 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a numberof former subsidiaries, 
including Linens ‘n Things and Bob’s Stores, each of which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The Company’s loss from discontinuedoperations in 2020
 primarily includes lease-related costs required to satisfy these lease guarantees.•
See “Discontinued Operations” in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ and “Lease Guarantees” in Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ includedin Item 8 of this 10-K for addi
tional information about the Company’s discontinued operations and the Company’s lease guarantees, respectively.70

Outlook for 2021With respect to 2021, the Company b
elieves you should consider the following important information:•
The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from continued growth in specialty pharmacy and our ability to drive further improvements inpurchasing economics, part
ially offset by continued price compression.•
The Retail/LTC segment is expected to benefit from increased prescription volume, diagnostic testing and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offsetby continued reimbursemen
t pressure and operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts. The projected adjustedprescription growth is expec
ted to be driven by the continued successful execution of our patient care programs, the anticipated return of provider visits as wemove through the year and vac
cination administration. While lower front store traffic has persisted into the first quarter of 2021, we expect front store traffic toincrease as we move through th
e year.•
The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in our Medicaidproducts, the adverse impa
ct of the COVID-19 pandemic and the removal of the HIF. The projected MBR is expected to increase compared to 2020, reflectingthe return to more norm
al levels of utilization, the removal of the HIF, lower Medicare risk adjustment revenue and the continued shift in business mix. TheCOVID-19 pandemic is expected to adve
rsely impact earnings in 2021 due to the regulatory changes included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021;testing, treatment 
and vaccination costs; and lower Medicare risk adjustment revenue.•
The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives that are expected to ramp as we move through theyear. Key drivers include:
◦
The ongoing digitalization of our business along with technology improvements in our operations,◦
Office real estate reductions associated with workforce management changes and◦
Productivity/operational efficiency initiatives within each of the Company’s segments.•
Based upon current tax legislation, the Company expects its effective income tax rate to decrease primarily due to the removal of the HIF in 2021.•
The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue topropose and enact signific
ant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company’s businesses.The Company’s current expect
ations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the“Cautionary Statement Conce
rning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company’s actualresults to differ from tho
se currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.71

Segment AnalysisThe following discussion of segment op
erating results is presented based on the Company’s reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance forsegment reporting and is cons
istent with the segment disclosure in Note 17 ‘‘Segment Reporting’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company has three operating s
egments, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company’ssegments maintain sepa
rate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on aregular basis in deciding how to 
allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of theCompany’s segments based on adjusted op
erating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization ofintangible assets and othe
r items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying businessperformance. See the r
econciliations of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excludedfrom operating income 
in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performanceas it enhances the Company’s ab
ility to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends.Non-GAAP financial measures the Company dis
closes, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to,financial measures d
etermined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.The following is a reconcil

The Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks,customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, techno
logy, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimateduseful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may no
t be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s statementsof operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets con
tribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directlyrelate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally,
intangible asset amortization expense typical
ly fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortizationof intangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the 
Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying businessperformance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial
statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has no
t been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded fromthe related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an in
tangible asset becomesimpaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.

In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately$850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction in operat
ing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment. In2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the el

adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy, partiallyoffset by continued price 
compression. The increase in operating income also was driven by lower amortization expense in 2020.•
As you review the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•
The Company’s efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates and/or discounts the Companyreceives from manuf
acturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on operating income and adjusted operating income. Inparticular, compet
itive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion ofrebates and/or discount
s received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited theCompany’s ability to offer p
lan sponsors pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread,” and the Company expects these trends tocontinue. The “differen
tial” or “spread” is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors,by a PBM and the price paid for the d
rug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.Pharmacy claims processed
•
Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either ourretail network pharma
cies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processedand expected amounts as well 
as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understandingthe impact of pharma
cy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•
The Company’s pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 5.1% to 1.8 billion claims in 2020 compared to 1.7 billion claimsin 2019. The increase in pharm
acy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business.•
The Company’s mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 4.1% to 322.8 million claims in 2020 compared to 310.2 million claimsin 2019. The increase in mai
l choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.Generic dispensing rate
•
Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment’s generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptionsprocessed or filled. Manag
ement uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are availableand clinically appropr
iate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors withinformation useful in unde
rstanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.•
The Pharmacy Services segment’s total generic dispensing rate remained consistent at 88.2% in both 2020 and 2019.76

Commentary - 2020 compared to 2019
Revenues
•
Total revenues increased $4.6 billion, or 5.3%, to $91.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increased prescription volume,COVID-19 diagnostic testing and brand inf

•Front store same store sales increased 0.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in consumer health and generalmerchandise sales.
•
Other revenues increased 83.7% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased diagnostic testing in response to the COVID-19pandemic in 2020.
Operating expenses
•
Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses,depreciation and amortization e
xpense and certain administrative expenses.•
Operating expenses increased $147 million, or 0.8%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to incremental operating expenses associatedwith the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response e
fforts, the increased volume described above and investments in the business in 2020. The increase waspartially offset by the ab
sence of $231 million of store rationalization charges in connection with the planned closure of underperforming retail pharmacystores and the $205 million pr
e-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, both recorded in 2019, as well as the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2020.•
Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 20.0% in 2020 compared to 20.9% in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses as apercentage of total 
revenues was primarily driven by the increases in total revenues described above.Operating income and adjusted operating income
•
Operating income decreased $153 million, or 2.6%, and adjusted operating income decreased $559 million, or 8.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decreasein both operating income and 
adjusted operating income was primarily due to continued reimbursement pressure and the net impact of the COVID-19pandemic, partially o
ffset by the increased pharmacy volume described above and improved generic drug purchasing. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted inreduced operating income a
nd adjusted operating income in 2020 as a result of decreased customer traffic in the segment’s retail pharmacies and MinuteCliniclocations and incremen
tal operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, partially offset by COVID-19 diagnostictesting. The decrease in op
erating income also was partially offset by the absence of the $231 million of store rationalization charges and the $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, both 
recorded in 2019.•
As you review the Retail/LTC segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•
The segment’s pharmacy operating income and adjusted operating income have been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations,PBMs and governmental and other thi
rd-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well aschanges in the mix of business with
in the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment maynot be able to grow revenues, and i
ts operating income and adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.•
The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment’s operating income and adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting the
ir efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Companyexpects to continue, reduc
es the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.Prescriptions filled
•
Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment’s pharmacies. Management uses this metric tounderstand variances betwe
en actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric providesmanagement and investors wi
th information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•
Prescriptions filled increased 3.4% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by the continued adoption of patient careprograms, partially of
fset by reduced new therapy prescriptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased long-term care prescription volume.Generic dispensing rate
•
Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Retail/LTC segment’s generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management usesthis metric to evalu
ate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aidsin decreasing costs for c
lient members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends insegment total revenues 
and operating results.•
The Retail/LTC segment’s generic dispensing rate remained consistent at 88.3% in both 2020 and 2019.78

Revenues
•
Total revenues increased $5.9 billion, or 8.4%, to $75.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by membership growth in the Health Care Benefitssegment’s Government products, 
the favorable impact of the reinstatement of the HIF for 2020 and the receipt of $313 million owed to the Company under theACA’s risk corridor program. These in
creases were partially offset by the divestitures of Aetna’s standalone PDPs (which the Company retained the financialresults of through 2019) and Worke
rs’ Compensation business, membership declines in the segment’s Commercial products and COVID-19 relatedinvestments benefiting 
customers in 2020.Medical Benefit Ratio 
(“MBR”)•
Medical benefit ratio is calculated as benefit costs divided by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefitsfor the Company’s Insured memb
ers. Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products,understand variances betwe
en actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investorswith information useful in 
assessing the operating results of the Company’s Insured Health Care Benefits products.•
The Health Care Benefits segment’s MBR decreased 330 basis points from 84.2% to 80.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to (i)the impact of the COVID-19 pandemi
c, which resulted in reduced benefit costs due(1)(2)

e HIF for 2020 and (iii) the receipt of amounts owed to the Company under the ACA’s risk corridor program in 2020.Operating expenses
•
Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.•
Operating expenses increased $1.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the reinstatement of the HIFwhich was $1.0 billion for 2020 and incre
mental operating expenses to support the increased membership described above, including operating expenses tosupport additional Medica
id members onboarded during the first quarter of 2020. The increase was partially offset by the divestitures of Aetna’s standalonePDPs and Workers’ Compensation business, the $269 m
illion pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business and the impact of cost savingsinitiatives in 2020.
Operating income and adjusted operating income
•
Operating income and adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in bothoperating income and adjus
ted operating income was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the divestitures of Aetna’sstandalone PDPs and Workers’ Compensation bus
iness. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced benefit costs due to the deferral of elective proceduresand other discretionary u
tilization, partially offset by COVID-19 related investments, testing and treatment costs. Operating income also includes pre-taxincome of $307 million assoc
iated with the receipt of amounts owed to the Company under the ACA’s risk corridor program and the $269 million pre-tax gainon the sale of the Workers

On April 6, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued its final notice detailing final 2021 Medicare Advantage benchmarkpayment rates (the “Fin
al Notice”). Overall the Company projects the benchmark rates in the Final Notice will increase funding for its Medicare Advantagebusiness, excluding the impac
t of the HIF in 2020, by approximately 1.8% in 2021 compared to 2020.(1)_____________________________________________

On January 15, 2021, CMS issued its Final Notice detailing final 2022 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage ratesresulted in an increas
e in industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%.The ACA ties a portion of each Medic
are Advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five)to qualify for bonus payments. CMS rel
eased the Company’s 2021 star ratings in October 2020. The Company’s 2021 star ratings will be used to determine whichof the Company’s Medicare Advant
age plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2022. Based on the Company’s membership atDecember 31, 2020, 83% of the Company’s Med
icare Advantage members were in plans with 2021 star ratings of at least four stars, consistent with 83% of theCompany’s Medicare Advantage m

Revenues
•
Revenues primarily relate to products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term careinsurance products, that wer
e acquired in the Aetna Acquisition. In 2018, revenues relate primarily to interest income on the proceeds from the financing of theAetna Acquisition.
•
Total revenues decreased $86 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net investment income including an $80 milliondecrease in net rea
lized capital gains in 2020 compared to 2019.Operating expenses
•
Operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment consist of management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations,which include certain as
pects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and financedepartments, expenses assoc
iated with the Company’s investments in its transformation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-relatedtransaction and integr
ation costs. Subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Date, segment operating expenses also include operating costs to support theCompany’s large case pensions and 
long-term care insurance products.•
Operating expenses increased $136 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by incremental operating expenses associated withthe Company’s investments in t
ransformation and its COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, as well as increased charitable contributions in 2020. The increasewas partially offset by a $148 
million decrease in acquisition-related integration costs compared to the prior year. (1)_____________________________________________

Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flows
The Company maintains a leve
l of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash andcapital structure to maximize share
holder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. The Company continuouslyassesses its regulatory c
apital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividendpayouts, potential share r
epurchases and future investments or acquisitions. The Company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, creditfacilities, sale
-leaseback program, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. Asof December 31, 2020, the Company had approx
imately $7.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $2.2 billion of which was held by the parentcompany or nonrestricted subs
idiaries.The COVID-19 pandemic has severely imp
acted global economic activity and during the first half of the year caused significant volatility and negative pressure inthe capital marke
ts. As a result of the uncertainty generated by COVID-19, on March 31, 2020, the Company issued $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount ofunsecured senior notes to enhan
ce its liquidity and strengthen its capital. As markets stabilized, in August 2020, the Company purchased $6.0 billion of itsoutstanding senior notes through c
ash tender offers, while issuing $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. In December 2020, theCompany purchased $4.5 billion of its ou
tstanding senior notes through cash tender offers, while issuing $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecuredsenior notes. The Company will continu
e to monitor the severity and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and global economies, consumer behaviorand health care util
ization patterns and our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.The net change in cash, cash equ

•
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.0 billion in 2020 co mpared to 2019 due primarily to higher operating income in the Health CareBenefits segment and the de
ferral of approximately $670 million of certain payroll tax payments to future years, as permitted in response to the COVID-19pandemic.
•
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $2.2 billion in 2020 co mpared to 2019 primarily due to increased net purchases of investments and anincrease in cash used for 
acquisitions, partially offset by $840 million in proceeds from the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business. In addition, cash usedin investing activities reflected
 the following activity:•
Gross capital expenditures remained relatively consistent at approximately $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020,approximately 62% of the Comp
any’s total capital expenditures were for technology and other corporate initiatives, 30% were for store, fulfillmentand support facilities 
expansion and improvements and 8% were for new store construction.•
Net cash used in financing activities increased slightly to $8.2 bi llion in 2020 compared to $7.9 billion in 2019. The increase in cash used in finance activitiesprimarily relat

tes due 2023, $2.3 billion of its 3.7% senior notes due 2023 and $3.0 billion of its 4.1% senior notes due 2025. In connection withthe purchase of such senior not
es, the Company paid a premium of $706 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that werepurchased, wrote-off $47 mil
lion of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $13 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of$766 million.

ents’’ and Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about debtissuances, debt repayments, sh
are repurchases and dividend payments.Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of thesederivatives is genera
lly limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts,warrants, put options and credi
t default swaps.Debt Covenants
The Company’s back-up revolving cr
edit facilities, unsecured senior notes and unsecured floating rate notes (see Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’included in Item 8 of this 10
-K) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company’sdebt maturities in th
e event of a downgrade in the84

Company’s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As ofDecember 31, 2020, the Company was in compl
iance with all of its debt covenants.Debt Ratings
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s long-t
erm debt was rated “Baa2” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’sFinancial Services LLC (“S&P”), and 
its commercial paper program was rated “P-2” by Moody’s and “A-2” by S&P. The outlook on the Company’s long-termdebt is “Stable” by S&P. In Decembe
r 2020, Moody’s changed the outlook on the Company’s long-term debt from “Negative” to “Stable.” In assessing theCompany’s credit strength, th
e Company believes that both Moody’s and S&P considered, among other things, the Company’s capital structure and financialpolicies as well as its conso
lidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity and other financial information. Although the Company currently believes itslong-term debt ratings wi
ll remain investment grade, it cannot guarantee the future actions of Moody’s and/or S&P. The Company’s debt ratings have a directimpact on its future bor
rowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.Share Repurchase Programs
During the years ended Decembe
r 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. See Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’included in Item 8 of this 10
-K for additional information on the Company’s share repurchase program.Quarterly Cash Dividend
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the quarterly cash d
ividend was $0.50 per share. CVS Health has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public companyand expects to maintain 
its quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share throughout 2021. Future dividends will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements,financial condition and o
ther factors considered relevant by the Board.Future Cash Requirements
The following table summar
izes certain estimated future cash requirements under the Company’s various contractual obligations at December 31, 2020, in totaland disaggregated into cur
rent and long-term obligations. The table below does not include future payments of claims to health care providers or pharmaciesbecause certain te

(5)Total payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders’ funds include $763 m illion, $2.0 billion and $210 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject toreinsurance. The Company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolida
ted balancesheets.

Customer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $2.9 bill ion have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at thecustomer’s discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. Additionally, net unreal
ized capital gains on debtsecurities supporting experience-rated products of $135 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.
Restrictions on Certain Payments
In addition to general st
ate law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenanceorganizations (“HMOs”) and insur
ance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certainlevels of equity (ref
erred to as surplus) and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. These regulations arenot directly applicab
le to CVS Health as a holding company, since CVS Health is not an HMO or an insurance company. In addition, in connection with the AetnaAcquisition, the Company made ce
rtain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its HMOs and insurance companies. Theadditional regulations 
and undertakings applicable to the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the Company’s ability toservice the Company’s debt, m
eet other financing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the Company’s subsidiaries to service their debt or otherfinancing obligations. Under app
licable regulatory requirements and undertakings, at December 31, 2020, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid bythe Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiar
ies without prior approval by regulatory authorities was $2.9 billion in the aggregate.The Company maintains capit
al levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of theselevels to meet liquid
ity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and stockholder dividends. In addition, at the Company’s discretion, it uses thesefunds for other purposes such as funding sh
are and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable.At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company held inv
estments of $524 million and $537 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as Separate Accountsassets but are legally s
egregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business. See Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-Kfor additional inform
ation on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.Solvency Regulation
The National Association of Insur
ance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) utilizes risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards for insurance companies that are designed toidentify weakly-capit
alized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the “RBC Ratio”). The RBC Ratio is designed toreflect the risk pro
file of insurance companies. Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the RBC Ratio decreases. Thereare four levels of regu
latory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC to the state insurancecommissioner to requir
ing the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. At December 31, 2020, the RBC Ratio of each of theCompany’s primary insurance subs
idiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action. The RBC framework described above for insurers has beenextended by the NAIC to health organi
zations, including HMOs. Although not all states had adopted these rules at December 31, 2020, at that date, each of theCompany’s active HMOs had a surplus that 
exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatoryaction under the NAIC’s RBC rules. External 
rating agencies use their own capital models and/or RBC standards when they determine a company’s rating.86

Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Company prepares the consolid
ated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to makecertain estimates and apply j
udgment. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to beimportant at the ti
me the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are appliedand disclosed in the
 consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered bymanagement support the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results coulddiffer from estimates, and s
uch differences could be material.Significant accounting pol
icies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Management believes the followingaccounting policies inc
lude a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. The Company has discussedthe development and sele
ction of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”), and the Audit Committee hasreviewed the disclosures r
elating to them.Revenue Recognition
Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retailpharmacy network. The Company’s phar
macy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are nocontractual minimum volumes a
nd each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time.PBM services performed in conne
ction with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing ofprescription drugs.
The Company recognizes revenue us
ing the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls theprescription drug before 
it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy networkbecause it has separate co
ntractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibilityfor fulfilling the pro
mise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.Revenues include (i) the por
tion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts andrefunds paid back to the cl
ient (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail orderprescriptions and the 
price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims basedadministrative fees for retail pharmac
y network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.The Company recognizes revenue when 
control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Companyexpects to be entitled 
to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for thePharmacy Services segment:
•
Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the clientplan member. At the tim
e of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does notexperience a significant level 
of returns or reshipments.•
Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees arerecognized at the Company’s po
int-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company hastransferred control o
f the prescription drug and performed all of its performance obligations.For contracts under which the Company 
acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognizedusing the net method.
Drug Discounts
The Company records revenue net o
f manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. TheCompany estimates these
 rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. Theestimates are based on 
the best available data at period-end87

and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. The Company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actualamounts paid when these rebat
es are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it isidentified. Adjustments
 generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between theestimated and actua
l product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. The effect of adjustments betweenestimated and actual manufacturers’
 rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Guarantees
The Company also adjusts revenues fo
r refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performancemetrics. The inputs to thes
e estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricingand performance refund 
amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Retail/LTC Segment
Retail Pharmacy
The Company’s retail drugstor
es recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is itsown arrangement with
 the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements.Revenues are adjusted for r
efunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service andperformance metrics. The inp
uts to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated andactual pricing and per
formance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Revenue from Company gift cards pu
rchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to beredeemed by customers (
i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.Customer returns are not m
aterial to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.Loyalty and Other Programs
The Company’s customer loyalty p
rogram, ExtraCare, consists of two components, ExtraSavings  and ExtraBucks  Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that arerecorded as a reduction o
f revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods orservices at the time of iss
uance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.ExtraBucks Rewards are accumul
ated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additionalperformance obligation to t
hose customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and theExtraBucks Rewards transaction bas
ed upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocatedto ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized 
as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contractliability.
The Company also offers a subscrip
tion-based membership program, CarePass, under which members are en titled to a suite of benefits delivered over the courseof the subscription period, as we
ll as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annualbasis at the time of or 
in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performanceobligations are satisfied.
Long-term Care
Revenue is recognized when contro
l of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expectsto be entitled to rec
eive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separateand distinct from other 
prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of Long-term Care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical andmedical products is re
imbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues andreceivables from these reimburseme
nt sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenuerecognition date to prope
rly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated®TM ® ®
88

differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statementsare recorded at the amount e
xpected to be ultimately received from these payors.Patient co-payments assoc
iated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not collected atthe time products are d
elivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accountsreceivable colle
ctions procedures.Walk-In Medical Clinics
For services provided by the Company’s wa
lk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments takenfor third party payor c
ontractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.Health Care Benefits Segment
Health Care Benefits revenu
e is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,which reflect contra
cted rates per employee and the number of covered employees recorded in the Company’s records at the time the billings are prepared. Billingsare generally sent mon
thly for coverage during the following month.The Company’s billings may be subsequen
tly adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known asretroactivity adjus
tments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As informationregarding actual re
troactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in whichthey arise. A significa
nt difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the Company’s operatingresults.
Premium Revenue
Premiums are recognized as
 revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance forestimated termin
ations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of theestimated minimum MLR rebate
s for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported asother insurance liabi
lities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.Some of the Company’s contracts 
allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustmentsare reasonably estimable at the
 outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under thecontract and the terms of t
he underlying contract.Services Revenue
Services revenue rela
tes to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct andaccounted for as separa
te performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange forperforming certain 
claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of theCompany’s administrative
 services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processingaccuracy and claim processin
g turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. Withany of these guarantees, th
e Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically islimited to a percen
tage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the termsof these guarantees and
 records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.Accounting for Medicare Par
t DRevenues include insurance pr
emiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangementswith CMS. The insurance premiums inc
lude a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case oflow-income members, and
 a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are thenrecognized ratably as 
revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.Revenues also include a risk-sh
aring feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable considerationin the form of amounts payab
le to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be receivedfrom or owed to CMS at the end of the r
eporting year.89

In addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies a
nd coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference isrecorded in either a
ccounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.Impairments of Debt Securities
The Company regularly reviews i
ts debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debtsecurity is in an unreal
ized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell thesecurity before recov
ery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in netincome. If a debt secur
ity is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will nothave to sell such sec
urity before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components.The amount of the credit
-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit relatedcomponent is included in othe
r comprehensive income. The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment whenperforming this analysis, 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.In evaluating whether a c
redit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortizedcost basis; adverse condit
ions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of theissuer of the security to 
make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2020, the Company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $49 million. During the year endedDecember 31, 2020, the Company did not re
cord credit-related impairment losses on debt securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Companyrecorded other-than-
temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses on debt securities of $24 million. There were no material OTTI losses on debt securities for the yearended December 31, 2018.
The risks inherent in
 assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts andcircumstances fac
tored into the Company’s assessment may change with the passage of time. Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that werenot present in past report
ing periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in priorreporting periods.
Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts
Vendor and manufacturer r
eceivables were $9.8 billion and $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the majority of which relate to purchasediscounts and vendor allowances as d
escribed below.Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalersand retail pharmac
ies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, ofthe following forms: (i) 
a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectlyfrom a manufacture
r (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized whenprescriptions are dispens
ed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect ofadjustments resulting f
rom the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company’s operating results orfinancial condition. The Comp
any accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed.The Pharmacy Services segmen
t also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition,the Pharmacy Services 
segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service feesare recorded as a redu
ction of cost of products sold.Retail/LTC Segment
Vendor allowances received by 
the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the relatedinventory is sold, unless they ar
e specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amountsthat are directly linked to a
dvertising commitments are90

recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowancesreceived in excess of th
e actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that arelinked to purchase commitme
nts is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract basedupon purchase volume. The total v
alue of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. Thedeferred amounts are then am
ortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract.The Company establishes a rec
eivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trends and data. The majority of vendor receivablesare collected within the foll
owing fiscal quarter. Historically, adjustments to the Company’s vendor receivables resulting from the reconciliation of receivablesrecognized to the amounts 
collected have not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.There have not been any mat
erial changes in the way the Company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years.Inventory
Inventories are valued 
at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.The value of ending inventory is 
reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physicalinventory counts are taken on 
a regular basis in each retail store and LTC pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validatethe inventory balances 
on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properlystated. The Company’s accounting 
for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurredduring the interim per
iod between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physicalinventory results on a loca
tion-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.The total reserve for 
estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $369 million and $401 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,respectively. Althoug
h management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventorylosses, it is possible that a
ctual results could differ. In order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertaintiesdiscussed above, a ten percen
t (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reservefor estimated invento
ry losses by approximately $37 million as of December 31, 2020.Although management 
believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles,actual results could di
ffer from such estimates, and such differences could be material.Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Company determines if an 
arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlyingasset for the lease term and
 lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities are recognized at the c
ommencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value ofthe remaining future minimum lea
se payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes itsincremental borrowing r
ate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include leasepayments made before co
mmencement and are reduced by lease incentives.The Company’s real estate 
leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options toextend are not considere
d reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic andstrategic incentiv
es of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periodsare not included withi
n the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly,renewal options are n
ot included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at leasecommencement. Leases wi
th an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basisover the term of the shor
t-term lease.91

For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases requireadditional payments based on s
ales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed asincurred as variable lease co
sts. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance.These fixed payments are 
considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.Long-Lived Asset Impairment
Recoverability of Defin
ite-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the re
coverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment usingseparate tests descr
ibed below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. TheCompany groups and evaluates these 
long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators ofimpairment are pr
esent, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group(undiscounted and without inter
est charges). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, animpairment loss cal
culation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cashflows (discounted and with inter
est charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the assetgroup’s estimated futur
e cash flows (discounted and with interest charges).The long-lived asset im
pairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales, profitabilityand cash flows. When preparing th
ese estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cashflow results and forecasts. Th
ese estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third partyorganizations to reduce 
their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumerspending patterns.
There were no materia
l impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, theCompany recorded st
ore rationalization charges of $231 million, primarily related to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges. During the year endedDecember 31, 2018, the Company recogni
zed a $43 million long-lived asset impairment charge, primarily related to the impairment of property and equipment.Recoverability of Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess o
f amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairmentreviews, or more frequent 
reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on areporting unit basis. The imp
airment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), includinggoodwill. The fair value of th
e reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net bookvalue (carrying amount
) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized inan amount equal to the exc
ess.The determination of th
e fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimatesprimarily include the selection
 of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries inwhich the Company competes; discoun
t rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes,capital expenditures 
and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers eachreporting unit’s histori
cal results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. TheCompany’s estimates can
 be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; theCompany’s market capita
lization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; thecontinued efforts of comp
etitors to gain market share, consumer spending patterns and the Company’s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and executeon its cost reduction init
iatives.2020 Goodwill Impairment Test
During the third quarter of 2020, 
the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that therewas no impairment of goodwill as o
f the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceedingtheir carrying values by s
ignificant margins, with the92

exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6% and 12%, respectively.In connection with the Aetna Acquis
ition in November 2018, the Company added the Health Care Benefits segment which included the Commercial Businessreporting unit. The transa
ction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed to be recognized a
t their fair values at the date of acquisition. As a result, at the time of the acquisition the fair value of the Commercial Business reportingunit was equal to its carry
ing value.The Company has experienced dec
lines in its Commercial Insured medical membership subsequent to the closing date of the Aetna Acquisition and may continueto do so for a number of reasons, in
cluding as a result of the competitive Commercial business environment. In addition, COVID-19 has had and may continue tohave an adverse impact on 
medical membership in the Commercial business due to reductions in workforce at existing customers (including due to businessfailures) as well as r
educed willingness to change benefit providers by prospective customers. The Company’s fair value estimate is sensitive to significantassumptions including changes in 
medical membership, revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate. Although the Company believes the financialprojections used to deter
mine the fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit in the third quarter of 2020 were reasonable and achievable, the challengesdescribed above may affect t
he Company’s ability to increase medical membership or operating income in the Commercial Business reporting unit at the rateestimated when such goodwill imp
airment test was performed and may continue to do so. As of December 31, 2020, the goodwill balance in the CommercialBusiness reporting unit was $26.5 billion.
The LTC reporting unit continues to 
experience industry-wide challenges that have impacted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that wasoriginally estimat
ed when the Company acquired Omnicare in 2015. Those challenges included lower client retention rates, lower occupancy rates in skillednursing facilities, th
e deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018,and continued facility 
reimbursement pressures. COVID-19 has also had an adverse impact on the financial health of the Company’s long-term care facilitycustomers due to declines 
in occupancy rates and increased operating expenses. A number of these customers have relied on supplemental liquidity sources such asgrants and advance Medica
re payments under programs expanded or created under the CARES Act to maintain adequate liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemicand may require addition
al sources of liquidity throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.Although the Company believes the f
inancial projections used to determine the fair value of the LTC reporting unit in the third quarter of 2020 were reasonable andachievable, the LTC report
ing unit has faced challenges that affect the Company’s ability to grow the LTC reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when suchgoodwill impairment tes
t was performed and may continue to do so. These challenges and some of the key assumptions included in the Company’s financialprojections to determine the
 estimated fair value of the LTC reporting unit include client retention rates; occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities; the financialhealth of skilled nursing f
acility customers; facility reimbursement pressures; the Company’s ability to extract cost savings from labor productivity and otherinitiatives; the geog
raphies impacted and the severity and duration of COVID-19; COVID-19’s impact on health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope andimpact of stimulus leg
islation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to COVID-19. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit also isdependent on market mult
iples of peer group companies and the risk-free interest rate environment, which impacts the discount rate used in the discounted cashflow valuation method. If th
e LTC reporting unit does not achieve its forecasts, it is reasonably possible in the near term that the goodwill of the LTC reporting unitcould be deemed to be impa
ired by a material amount. As of December 31, 2020, the goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit was $431 million.The COVID-19 pandemic severely impa
cted global economic activity in 2020, including the businesses of some of the Company’s customers, and during the firsthalf of the year caused s
ignificant volatility and negative pressure in the capital markets. In addition to adversely affecting the Company’s businesses, which mayhave a material adverse impact o
n the Company’s profitability and cash flows, these developments may adversely affect the timing and collectability of paymentsto the Company from customers, 
clients, government payers and members as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on them. For further information regarding thepotential adverse imp
act of COVID-19 on the Company, please see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this report. The COVID-19 pandemic continues toevolve. We believe COVID-19’s impa
ct on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographiesimpacted and the sever
ity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health careutilization patte
rns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Thoseprimary drivers are b
eyond our knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/orfinancial condition is un
certain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations andclaims against
93

us. If the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows are materially adversely affected, the goodwill of the LTC andCommercial Business report
ing units could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount.2019 Goodwill Impairment Test
During the third quarter of 2019, 
the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that therewas no impairment of goodwill as o
f the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceedingtheir carrying values by s
ignificant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values byapproximately 4% and 9%, r
espectively.2018 Goodwill Impairment Tests
As discussed in Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Int
angibles’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K, during 2018, the LTC reporting unit experienced industry-widechallenges that impa
cted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the Company acquired Omnicare and when the2017 annual goodwill impairmen
t test was performed. Those challenges include lower client retention rates, lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities, thedeteriorating finan
cial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018, and continued facilityreimbursement pressur
es. Following the update of its current and long-term forecast, in June 2018, management determined that there were indicators that the LTCreporting unit’s goodwill may b
e impaired and, accordingly, management performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2018. The results of thatinterim impairm
ent test showed that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in a $3.9 billion pre-tax goodwillimpairment charge 
in the second quarter of 2018.During the third quarter of 2018, 
the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill.The goodwill impairment t
ests showed that the fair values of the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy reporting units exceeded their carrying values bysignificant margins and 
the fair value of the LTC reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 2%.During the fourth quarter of 2018, 
the LTC reporting unit missed its forecast primarily due to operational issues and customer liquidity issues, including onesignificant customer b
ankruptcy. Additionally, LTC management submitted updated projected financial results which showed significant additional deteriorationprimarily due to continu
ed industry and operational challenges, which also caused management to make further updates to its long-term forecast beyond 2019.Based on these updated project
ions, management determined that there were indicators that the LTC reporting unit’s goodwill may be further impaired and,accordingly, managemen
t performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018. The results of that interim impairment test showed thatthe fair value of the LTC r
eporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in an additional $2.2 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in the fourthquarter of 2018.
In 2018, the fair value of th
e LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. In additionto the lower financial p
rojections, changes in risk-free interest rates and lower market multiples of peer group companies also contributed to the amount of the 2018goodwill impairment cha
rges.Recoverability of Indefinite-
Lived Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible as
sets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying valuemay not be recoverable. 
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value ofthe asset exceeds its es
timated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.The indefinite-lived intangi
ble asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on theassumption that, in lieu of owne
rship of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Fair value isestimated by discountin
g the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected bya number of factors inclu
ding general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the Company. There were no impairmentlosses recognized on indefin
ite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.Health Care Costs Payable
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, 77% and 73% respe
ctively, of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to theCompany’s Insured members but not y
et reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been94

reported to the Company but not yet paid (collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to berendered after the financial statement
 date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Theremainder of health 
care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharingagreements and accru
als for state assessments. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerousfactors. See Note 1 ‘‘Signifi
cant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company’s reserving methodology.During 2020 and 2019, the Company observed an incr
ease in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. After considering the claims paidin 2020 and 2019 with dates of service p
rior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed assumed incurred claim weighted averagecompletion factors th
at were 4 and 27 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $35 million and $240 million in 2020and 2019, respectively, in hea
lth care costs payable that related to the prior year. The Company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factorswhen determining the compl
etion factors used in its estimates of IBNR as of December 31, 2020. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonablypossible that the Company’s est
imated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 11 basis points from the Company’s assumed rates, whichcould impact health c
are costs payable by approximately plus or minus $140 million pretax.Also during 2020 and 2019, the Company observed that h
ealth care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statementdate were lower than previous
ly estimated. Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2020 and 2019 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of theprevious year, the Company observed h
ealth care costs that were 4.0% and 3.2% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting ina reduction of $394 million 
and $284 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.Management considers histo
rical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developingestimates of curren
t health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2020, the Company increased its assumed health care cost trendrates for the most re
cent three months by 9.6% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. Assumed health care cost trend rates during the fourth quarter of2020 are elevated compa
red to historical levels due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on utilization during 2020. Specifically, beginning in mid-March, thehealth system experienced a
 significant reduction in utilization that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures. Utilization remained belowhistorical levels th
rough April, began to recover in May and June and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters, with select geographies impactedby COVID-19 waves. Based on historical claim 
experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus orminus 3.5% from the assumed r
ates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $404 million pretax.Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income 
taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differencesbetween financial and tax
 reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporarydifferences revers
e. Such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. Deferred tax assetsare reduced, if necess
ary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain.Significant judgment is r
equired in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in theordinary course of business, the
re are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company’s tax returns aresubject to audit by various dom
estic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. Althoughmanagement believes that its e
stimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared, actual results coulddiffer from these estimates resulti
ng in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.The tax benefit from an un
certain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxingauthorities, based on the t
echnical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are thenmeasured based on the
 largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and/orpenalties related 
to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. TheCompany has established accru
als for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances.95

ial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity riskand operational risk.
Evaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality Risk
The Company manages interest 
rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Companymanages credit quali
ty risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. Inconnection with its investm
ent and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partiallydetermined by, among other 
things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or creditratings/spreads. The Company’s use o
f these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury ratelocks, forward contracts, fu
tures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to varyingdegrees of interest r
ate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for hedging, the Company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk.Investments
The Company’s investment portfo
lio supported the following products at December 31, 2020 and 2019:In millions
2020 2019 Experience-rated products
$ 1,037 $ 1,100 Remaining products
22,775 18,587 Total investments
$ 23,812 $ 19,687 Investment risks associa
ted with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investmentssupporting experience-r
ated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by thecontract holders and not by th
e Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may besubject to contract hold
er or participant withdrawals.The debt securities in th
e Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 with approximately $6.3billion and $4.4 billion rat
ed AAA at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The debt securities that were rated below investment grade (that is, having acredit quality rat
ing below BBB-/Baa3) were $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively (of which 2% and 4% at December 31,2020 and 2019, respectively, supported 
experience-rated products).At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company held $321 m
illion and $333 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties,representing 2% of tota
l investments at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA at both December 31, 2020and 2019 with the guarantee. These s
ecurities had an average credit quality rating of A and A+ at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, without theguarantee. The Company does not have 
any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or indirect).The Company generally classi
fies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31, 2020and 2019, less than 1% of debt secur
ities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance withaccounting principles gen
erally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information onthe methodologies and key assump
tions used to determine the fair value of investments. For additional information related to investments, see Note 3‘‘Investments’’ inc
luded in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company regularly reviews deb
t securities in its portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If adebt security is in an unre
alized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell thesecurity before recov
ery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in netincome. If a debt secur
ity is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will nothave to sell such sec
urity before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components.The amount of the credit
-related component is recorded as an allowance97

for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income. The impairment ofdebt securities is consid
ered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of Debt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 ofthis 10-K for additional info
rmation.Evaluation of Market Valuation Risks
The Company regularly evalua
tes its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term orlong-term), duration, pr
epayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investmentsrelative to manage
ment-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.On a quarterly basis, the Company r
eviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financialcondition, operating resul
ts and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest ratechanges (whether resulting 
from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for theCompany. The Company has estimated th
e impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using arepresentative set o
f likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates (whichthe Company believes repres
ents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and animmediate decrease of 15% in 
prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities.Assuming an immediate inc
rease of 100 basis points in interest rates, the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at December 31, 2020is as follows:
•
The fair value of long-term debt issued by the Company would decline by approximately $5.3 billion ($6.7 billion pretax). Changes in the fair value of long-term debt do not impact 
the Company’s operating results or financial condition.•
The theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest ratesensitive liabilities woul
d result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $490 million ($615 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-ratedproducts. Reductions in the fai
r value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debtsecurities as avail
able for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.If the value of the Company’s pub
licly traded domestic equity securities were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net decline in fair value of $5 million($7 million pretax).
Based on overall exposure to int
erest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affectconsolidated near-te
rm financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2020.Evaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity Risk
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not hav
e any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place andbelieves its exposure t
o foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.At December 31, 2020 and 2019, 5.5% and 6.1%, respe
ctively, of the Company’s investment portfolio was comprised of investments that have exposure to the oiland gas industry, with more than ha
lf that amount comprised of investment grade rated debt securities. These exposures are experiencing varied degrees offinancial strains in 
the current depressed oil and gas price environment, and the likelihood of the Company’s portfolio incurring additional realized capital losses onthese exposures may incre
ase if such depressed prices persist and/or decline further.98

Evaluation of Operational RisksThe Company also faces cert
ain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and risks related to information security, includingcybersecurity.
The spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to 
mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively,including as a result of th
e complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages. Disruptions in our supply chains, our distribution chains and/or public andprivate infrastruc
ture, including communications, financial services and supply chains, could materially and adversely impact our business operations. We havetransitioned a signifi
cant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as have a significant number ofour third-party servic
e providers, which may amplify certain risks to our businesses, including an increased demand for information technology resources,increased risk of phishing and o
ther cyber attacks, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidentialinformation about us or our m
edical members or other third-parties and increased risk of business interruptions.The Company and its vendors have exper
ienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. As examples, theCompany and its vendors have experi
enced attempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanningactivity and phishing ema
ils. Attacks can originate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continueto dedicate signific
ant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigatethe information secur
ity risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts byunauthorized parties to ob
tain access to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage. The impact of cyber attacks has not beenmaterial to the Company
’s operations or operating results through December 31, 2020. The Board and its Audit Committee and Nominating and CorporateGovernance Committee ar
e regularly informed regarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status.99

Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of Business 
CVS Health Corporation (“CVS Health”), togethe
r with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), has more than 9,900 retail locations, approximately 1,100walk-in medical clinics, a lea
ding pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 105 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business servingmore than one million pa
tients per year and expanding specialty pharmacy services. The Company also serves an estimated 34 million people through traditional,voluntary and consumer-dir
ected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standaloneMedicare Part D prescrip
tion drug plan (“PDP”). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better healthoutcomes and lowers overall h
ealth care costs.The coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) p
andemic has severely impacted the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact ofCOVID-19 on the Company’s businesses, operating resu
lts, cash flows and financial condition in the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as informationregarding certain exp
ected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.On November 28, 2018 (the “Aetna Acquisition Da
te”), the Company acquired Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”). As a result of the acquisition of Aetna (the “AetnaAcquisition”), the Company added th
e Health Care Benefits segment. Certain aspects of Aetna’s operations, including products for which the Company no longersolicits or accepts new cus
tomers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products, are included in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment. Theconsolidated financia
l statements reflect Aetna’s results subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Date.The Company has four reportable s
egments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC, Health Care Benefits and Corporate/Other, which are described below.Pharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration,formulary management, retail pharmac
y network management services, mail order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, diseasemanagement services 
and medical spend management. The Pharmacy Services segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions,government employee groups, he
alth plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on public health insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) andprivate health insuran
ce exchanges and other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retailspecialty pharmacy sto
res, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteralnutrition services.
Retail/LTC Segment
The Retail/LTC segment sells p
rescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care servicesthrough its MinuteClinic
 walk-in medical clin ics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 andshingles and conducts long-ter
m care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and otherancillary services 
to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2020, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations,approximately 1,100 MinuteClin
ic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies.Health Care Benefits Segment
The Health Care Benefits segm
ent is one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the informationand resources to help memb
ers, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health CareBenefits segment offers 
a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy,dental and behavioral he
alth plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health caremanagement services 
and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers’ compensationadministrative serv
ices through its Coventry Health Care Workers’ Compensation business (“Workers’ Compensation business”) prior to the sale of this businesson July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits seg
ment’s customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, healthplans, health care provid
ers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The®107

Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative servicescontract products (where 
the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” For periods prior to the AetnaAcquisition Date, the Health Car
e Benefits segment was comprised only of the Company’s SilverScript PDP business. Corporate/Other Segment
The Company presents the rema
inder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•
Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and thecorporate relations, 
legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’sinvestments in its transf
ormation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; and•
Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as its large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidat
ed financial statements of CVS Health and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United Sta
tes of America (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-ownedsubsidiaries and variable
 interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions havebeen eliminated.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amoun
ts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in theconsolidated financial statement
s and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-termmoney market funds, comme
rcial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanyingconsolidated balance she
ets, as these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash.Restricted Cash
Restricted cash included 
in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets represents amounts held in escrow accounts in connection with certain recentacquisitions. Restricted 
cash included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets represents amounts held in a trust in one of the Company’s captiveinsurance companies to sa
tisfy collateral requirements associated with the assignment of certain insurance policies. All restricted cash is invested in time deposits,money market funds or comm
ercial paper.The following is a reconcil
iation of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets to total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on theconsolidated statemen

InvestmentsDebt Securities
Debt securities consist pr
imarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate and foreign bonds and other debt securities. Debtsecurities are cl
assified as either current or long-term investments based on their contractual maturities unless the Company intends to sell an investment within thenext twelve months, in which case 
it is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities are classified as available for sale and are carried atfair value. See Note 4 ‘‘Fai
r Value’’ for additional information on how the Company estimates the fair value of these investments.If a debt security is in 
an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sellthe security before r
ecovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized innet income. If a debt se
curity is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company willnot have to sell suc
h security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit relatedcomponents. In evaluating wheth
er a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less thanthe amortized cost bas
is; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; thefailure of the issuer o
f the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. The amountof the credit-rel
ated component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component isincluded in other compreh
ensive income. Interest is not accrued on debt securities when management believes the collection of interest is unlikely.The credit-related component i
s determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security, considering all reasonablyavailable informa
tion relevant to the collectability of the security, with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to becollected is less than 
the amortized cost basis of the security, the Company records an allowance for credit losses, which is limited by the amount that the fair valueis less than amortized 
cost basis.For mortgage-backed and othe
r asset-backed securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and theestimated economic life of the 
securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date andanticipated future p
ayments. The Company’s investment in the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been appliedsince the acquisition of 
the security, with adjustments recognized in net income.Equity Securities
Equity securities with
 readily available fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income (loss).Mortgage Loans
Mortgage loan investments on 
the consolidated balance sheets are valued at the unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans witha maturity date or a 
committed prepayment date within twelve months are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company assesses whetherits loans share simila
r risk characteristics and, if so, groups such loans in a risk pool when measuring expected credit losses. The Company considers the followingcharacteristics when evaluatin
g whether its loans share similar risk characteristics: loan-to-value ratios, property type (e.g., office, retail, apartment, industrial),geographic location, vac
ancy rates and property condition.Credit loss reserves are d
etermined using a loss rate method that multiplies the unpaid principal balance of each loan within a risk pool group by an estimated lossrate percentage. The 
loss rate percentage considers both the expected loan loss severity and the probability of loan default. For periods where the Company is ableto make or obtain reasonab
le and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions (e.g., gross domestic product, employment), the Company adjusts itsexpected loss rates to r
eflect these forecasted economic conditions. For periods beyond which the Company is able to make or obtain reasonable and supportableforecasts of expected 
economic conditions, the Company reverts to historical loss rates in determining expected credit losses.Interest income on a pot
ential problem loan (i.e., high probability of default) or restructured loan is accrued to the extent it is deemed to be collectible and the loancontinues to perform under 
its original or restructured terms. Interest income on problem loans (i.e., more than 60 days delinquent, in bankruptcy or in process offoreclosure) is recogn
ized on a cash basis. Cash payments on loans in the process of foreclosure are treated as a return of principal.109

Other InvestmentsOther investments consist pr
imarily of the following:•
Private equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value ofthe investment is based on th
e value of the Company’s equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager of theinvestments, the financ
ial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by the fundmanagers, these investm
ents are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least quarterly andmonitors their perfor
mance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the Company becomes awareof an impairment of a limited 
partnership’s investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership’s financial statements at the financialstatement date, an i
mpairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited partnership with a corresponding charge to netinvestment income.
•
Investment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in fair val
ue. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real estateinvestment is considered h
eld-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company generally estimatesfair value using a discount
ed future cash flow analysis in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time of the sale, the difference between thesales price and the carryin
g value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss.•
Privately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments forobservable price changes. Addi
tionally, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”), a subsidiary of the Company is required topurchase and hold shares of the FHLBB. These shar
es are restricted and carried at cost.Net Investment Income
Net investment income on th
e Company’s investments is recorded when earned and is reflected in the Company’s net income (other than net investment income onassets supporting experienc
e-rated products). Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder, not theCompany, assumes investment and oth
er risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investmentperformance on experi
ence-rated products is allocated to contract holders’ accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does notimpact the Company’s net in
come (as long as the contract’s minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large casepensions’ experience-r
ated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders’ accountsthrough a charge to benefi
t costs.Realized capital ga
ins and losses on investments (other than realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are included asa component of net in
vestment income in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized capital gains and losses are determined on a specific identificationbasis. Purchases and sales of debt 
and equity securities and alternative investments are reflected on the trade date. Purchases and sales of mortgage loans andinvestment real estate are reflected o
n the closing date.Realized capital ga
ins and losses on investments supporting large case pensions’ experience-rated products are not included in realized capital gains and losses inthe consolidated statements
 of operations and instead are credited directly to contract holders’ accounts. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected inpolicyholders’ funds on the consol
idated balance sheets.Unrealized capital g
ains and losses on investments (other than unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) arereflected in shareho
lders’ equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized capital gains and losses on investmentssupporting large case 
pensions’ experience-rated products are credited directly to contract holders’ accounts. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected inpolicyholders’ funds on the consol
idated balance sheets.Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of thesederivatives is genera
lly limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts,warrants, put options and credi
t default swaps.110

edit losses was $358 million as of December 31, 2020. When developing an estimate of the Company’s expected credit losses, theCompany considers all avail
able relevant information regarding the collectability of cash flows, including historical information, current conditions and reasonableand supportable forecasts o
f future economic conditions over the contractual life of the receivable. The Company’s accounts receivable are short duration in natureand typically settle 
in less than 30 days. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was $319 million as of December 31, 2019.Inventories
Inventories are valued 
at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis ineach retail store 
and LTC pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in eachdistribution center and mail
 facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. During the interim periodbetween physical inventory coun
ts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical results andcurrent physical invento
ry trends.Reinsurance Recoverables
The Company utilizes
 reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance contracts.Ceded reinsurance agree
ments permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s primaryliability as the dir
ect insurer of the risks reinsured. Failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company could result in losses; however, the Company does not expectcharges for unrecoverable rei
nsurance to have a material effect on its consolidated operating results or financial condition. The Company evaluates the financialcondition of its reinsure
rs and monitors concentrations of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of its reinsurers.At December 31, 2020, the Company’s reinsu
rance recoverables consisted primarily of amounts due from third parties that are rated consistent with companies thatare considered to have th
e ability to meet their obligations. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balancesheets.
Health Care Contract Acquisition Costs
Insurance products included 
in the Health Care Benefits segment are cancelable by either the customer or the member monthly upon written notice. Acquisitioncosts related to prepaid 
health care and health indemnity contracts are generally expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs for certain long-duration insurancecontracts are deferred and are rec
orded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the estimated life of thecontracts. The amorti
zation of deferred acquisition costs is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2020 and2019, the balance of defer
red acquisition costs was $546 million and $271 million, respectively, comprised primarily of commissions paid on MedicareSupplement products within the Hea
lth Care Benefits segment.Property and Equipment
Property and equipme
nt is reported at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property, equipment and improvements to leased premises are depreciatedusing the straight-line 
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or when applicable, the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful livesgenerally range from 1 
to 40 years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for fixtures, equipment and internallydeveloped
111

software. Repair and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of anasset are capitalized and depreciate
d. Application development stage costs for significant internally developed software projects are capitalized and depreciated.Property and equipment consists o

er 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about finance leases.Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Company determines if an 
arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlyingasset for the lease term and
 lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities are recognized at the c
ommencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value ofthe remaining future minimum lea
se payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes itsincremental borrowing r
ate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include leasepayments made before co
mmencement and are reduced by lease incentives.The Company’s real estate 
leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options toextend are not considere
d reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic andstrategic incentiv
es of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periodsare not included withi
n the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly,renewal options are n
ot included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at leasecommencement. Leases wi
th an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basisover the term of the shor
t-term lease.For real estate leas
es, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases requireadditional payments based on s
ales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed asincurred as variable lease co
sts. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance.These fixed payments are 
considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for add
itional information about right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.Goodwill
The Company accounts for business comb
inations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair valueof net assets acquired and 
identifiable intangible assets to be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment reviews annually, ormore frequently if ne
cessary, as further described below. See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about goodwill.112

Intangible AssetsThe Company’s identifiable 
intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, trade names, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology,provider networks and value of busin
ess acquired (“VOBA”). These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair market valuesat the date of acquisi
tion. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation techniques andmanagement estimates.
The Company’s definite-liv
ed intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the asset.Other than VOBA, definite-lived int
angible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contractsin proportion to estimate
d premiums. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if necessary, asfurther described in “Long
-Lived Asset Impairment” below.See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangib
les’’ for additional information about intangible assets.Long-Lived Asset Impairment
The Company evaluates the re
coverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment usingseparate tests descr
ibed below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The Companygroups and evaluates these long
-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment arepresent, the Company first co
mpares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted andwithout interest charges
). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculationis prepared. The impair
ment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and withinterest charges). I
f required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cashflows (discounted and with inter
est charges). There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020.During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2019, the Company recorded store rationalization charges of $231 million, primarily related to operating lease right-of-useasset impairment ch
arges. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about the right-of-use asset impairment charges. During the year ended December 31,2018, the Company recognized a $43 mi
llion long-lived asset impairment charge, primarily related to the impairment of property and equipment.When evaluating goodwill for po
tential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The Companyestimates the fai
r value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of areporting unit exceeds i
ts estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the third quarter of both 2020 and 2019,the Company performed its r
equired annual goodwill impairment tests and concluded there were no goodwill impairments as of the testing dates or during the yearsended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwil
l and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about goodwill impairment charges recorded duringthe year ended December 31, 2018.
Indefinite-lived intangible as
sets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fairvalue of its indefinite-lived
 trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fairvalue, an impairment 
loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-livedintangible assets in any of 
the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.Separate Accounts
Separate Accounts assets and l
iabilities related to large case pensions products represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders who bearthe investment risk. T
hese assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income (including net realized capital gains and losses) accrue directly tosuch contract holders. The ass
ets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company’s other businesses. Deposits,withdrawals and net investmen
t income (including net realized and net unrealized capital gains and losses) on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in theconsolidated statemen
ts of operations or cash flows. Management fees charged to contract holders are included in services revenue and recognized over the periodearned.

Health Care Costs PayableHealth care costs payable
 consist principally of unpaid fee-for-service medical, dental and pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other amounts due to providerspursuant to risk-sharing ar
rangements related to the Health Care Benefits segment’s Insured Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products and accruals for stateassessments. Unpaid health ca
re claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured members butnot yet reported to the Company 
and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively,“IBNR”). Health care
 costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if theCompany is obligated to pay for such s
ervices in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Such estimates are developed using actuarial principlesand assumptions which consider, among o
ther things, historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, assumed and historical medical costtrends, historical uti
lization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in Insured membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors.The Company reflects changes 
in these estimates in benefit costs in the Company’s consolidated operating results in the period they are determined. Capitationcosts represent contractual m
onthly fees paid to participating physicians and other medical providers for providing medical care, regardless of the volume ofmedical services prov
ided to the Insured member. Amounts due under risk-sharing arrangements are based on the terms of the underlying contracts with theproviders and consi
der claims experience under the contracts through the financial statement date.The Company develops its estima
te of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. Of those factors, the Company considersthe analysis of historic
al and projected claim payment patterns (including claims submission and processing patterns) and the assumed health care cost trend rate(the year-over-yea
r change in per member per month health care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. In developing its IBNR estimate, the Companyconsistently applies thes
e actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been no significantchanges to the methodologies o
r assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of IBNR in 2020.The Company analyze
s historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates toestimate “completion factors.” T
he Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months beforethe financial statement date. T
he Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment andestimating the percentage of claim
s incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paidwithin six months of the date of s
ervice, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid.These historically-derived c
ompletion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a givenmonth’s incurred claim activity
. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents theCompany’s estimate of cl
aims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company’s health care costs payable. The completionfactors the Company uses ref
lect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and,to a lesser extent, othe
r factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submittedor processed on a faster (s
lower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company’s completionfactors, which may result 
in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.Because claims incurred 
within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derivedcompletion factors and the
 assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarialjudgment and places a 
greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced byseasonal patterns and chang
es in membership and product mix.The Company’s health care cos
t trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such services.Many factors influence 
the health care cost trend rate, including the Company’s ability to manage benefit costs through product design, negotiation of favorableprovider contracts and m
edical management programs, as well as the mix of the Company’s business. The health status of the Company’s Insured members, agingof the population an
d other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per member utilizationand unit costs. Changes in health c
are practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs),direct-to-consumer marketing b
y pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory environment, health careprovider or member fr
aud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company’s health care cost trend rate.114

For each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result, considerablevariability and uncertainty i
s inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financialstatement date; and 
the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. Foreach reporting period the
 Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential volatility in assumed completionfactors and health ca
re cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs payable is reasonable and adequate to coverits obligations at Decemb
er 31, 2020; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company’s estimates. A worsening (or improvement) of the Company’shealth care cost tr
end rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in estimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2020would cause these estimat
es to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.Each quarter, the Company re
-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and otherchanges in facts and cir
cumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company’s estimates of health care costspayable could develop eith
er favorably (that is, its actual benefit costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably. The changes in the Company’sestimate of health 
care costs payable may relate to a prior quarter, prior year or earlier periods. For a roll forward of the Company’s health care costs payable, seeNote 7 ‘‘Health Care Costs Payable.’
’ The Company’s reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of its ultimate liability for healthcare costs payable.
Other Insurance Liabilities
Unpaid Claims
Unpaid claims consist
 primarily of reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts, including an estimate forIBNR as of the financial stat
ement date. Reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts are based upon theCompany’s estimate of the p
resent value of future benefits, which is based on assumed investment yields and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity andrecoveries from the U.S. Socia
l Security Administration. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider,among other things,
 contractual requirements, claim incidence rates, claim recovery rates, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company discounts certainclaim liabilities related to group
 long-term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contracts. The discount rates generally reflect the Company’s expectedinvestment returns for the
 investments supporting all incurral years of these liabilities. The discount rates for retrospectively-rated contracts are set at contractuallyspecified levels. The Company
’s estimates of unpaid claims are subject to change due to changes in the underlying experience of the insurance contracts, changesin investment yields or oth
er factors, and these changes are recorded in current and future benefits in the consolidated statements of operations in the period theyare determined. The Company 
estimates its reserve for claims IBNR for life products largely based on completion factors. The completion factors used are basedon the Company’s historical exp
erience and reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim payment patterns,changes in business volume and othe
r factors. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than historical periods, the actual claims may be more(less) complete than originall
y estimated using completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required to cover future life benefitpayments. There have been no sign
ificant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of unpaid claims IBNR in 2020.As of December 31, 2020, unpaid claims b
alances of $532 million and $1.5 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insuranceliabilities, respe
ctively. As of December 31, 2019, unpaid claims balances of $704 million and $1.8 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and otherlong-term insurance liabilities,
 respectively.Substantially all lif
e and disability insurance liabilities have been fully ceded to unrelated third parties through indemnity reinsurance agreements; however, theCompany remains directly ob
ligated to the policyholders.Future Policy Benefits
Future policy benefits consis
t primarily of reserves for limited payment pension and annuity contracts and long-term care insurance contracts. Reserves for limitedpayment pension and annuity cont
racts are computed using actuarial principles that consider, among other things, assumptions reflecting anticipated mortality,retirement, expense 
and interest rate experience. Such assumptions generally vary by plan, year of issue and policy duration. Assumed interest rates on suchcontracts ranged from 3.3
% to 11.3% in the year ended December 31, 2020 and from 3.5% to 11.3% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Companyperiodically reviews mo
rtality assumptions against both industry standards and its experience. Reserves for long-duration long-term care contracts represent theCompany’s estimate of the p
resent value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums. The assumedinterest rate on such con
tracts was 5.1% in both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s estimate of the present value of future benefitsunder such contracts is based upon 
mortality, morbidity and interest rate assumptions. As of December 31, 2020, future policy benefits115

balances of $462 million and $5.5 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. As of December 31,2019, future policy benefits b
alances of $508 million and $5.6 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities,respectively.
Premium Deficiency Reserves
The Company evaluates its insur
ance contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred. A premium deficiency loss is recognized when it isprobable that expected 
future claims, including maintenance costs (for example, direct costs such as claim processing costs), will exceed existing reserves plusanticipated future premiums an
d reinsurance recoveries. Anticipated investment income is considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for short-duration contracts. For purposes o
f determining premium deficiency losses, contracts are grouped consistent with the Company’s method of acquiring, servicingand measuring the profit
ability of such contracts. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company established a premium deficiency reserve of $11 million and$4 million, respective
ly, related to Medicaid products in the Health Care Benefits segment.Policyholders’ Funds
Policyholders’ funds consist pri
marily of reserves for pension and annuity investment contracts and customer funds associated with certain health contracts.Reserves for such contracts 
are equal to cumulative deposits less withdrawals and charges plus interest credited thereon, net of experience-rated adjustments. In2020, interest rates for p
ension and annuity investment contracts ranged from 4.1% to 5.1%. In 2019, interest rates for pension and annuity investment contractsranged from 3.5% to 5.2%. Reserves 
for contracts subject to experience rating reflect the Company’s rights as well as the rights of policyholders and planparticipants. The Company also ho
lds funds for health savings accounts (“HSAs”) on behalf of members associated with high deductible health plans. Theseamounts are held to pay for qu
alified health care expenses incurred by these members. The HSA balances were approximately $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion atDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectiv
ely, and are reflected in other current assets with a corresponding liability in policyholders’ funds.Policyholders’ funds liabil
ities that are expected to be paid within twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as current on the consolidated balancesheets. Policyholders’ funds li
abilities that are expected to be paid greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are included in other long-term liabilitieson the consolidated balanc
e sheets.Self-Insurance Liabilities
The Company is self-insured for 
certain losses related to general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. The Company obtains third party insurancecoverage to limit exposu
re from these claims. The Company is also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. The Company’s self-insurance accruals, which 
include reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, are calculated using standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions andthe Company’s historical c
laims experience. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, self-insurance liabilities totaled $927 million and $856 million, respectively, andwere recorded as accru
ed expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
For non-U.S. dollar functional curr
ency locations, (i) assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates, (ii) revenues and expenses are translated ataverage exchange rates in effect
 during the period and (iii) equity is translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting cumulative translation adjustments areincluded as a component of a
ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss).For U.S. dollar functional curren
cy locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except fornonmonetary balance sheet
 accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effectduring each period, except 
for those expenses related to the nonmonetary balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or lossesfrom foreign currency remeasureme
nt are included in net income (loss).Gains and losses from foreign cu
rrency transactions and the effects of foreign currency remeasurements were not material in the years ended December 31, 2020 or2018. On July 1, 2019, the Company sold its Brazilian subs
idiary, Drogaria Onofre Ltda. (“Onofre”) for an immaterial amount. The Company recorded a loss onthe divestiture, which
 included the elimination of the subsidiary’s $154 million cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive incomeduring the year ended Decemb
er 31, 2019.116

Revenue RecognitionPharmacy Services Segment
The Pharmacy Services segmen
t sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retailpharmacy network. The Company’s phar
macy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are nocontractual minimum volumes a
nd each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time.PBM services performed in conne
ction with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing ofprescription drugs.
The Company recognizes revenue us
ing the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls theprescription drug before 
it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy networkbecause it has separate co
ntractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibilityfor fulfilling the pro
mise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.Revenues include (i) the por
tion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts andrefunds paid back to the cl
ient (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail orderprescriptions and the 
price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims basedadministrative fees for retail pharmac
y network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.The Company recognizes revenue when 
control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Companyexpects to be entitled 
to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for thePharmacy Services segment:
•
Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the clientplan member. At the tim
e of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does notexperience a significant level 
of returns or reshipments.•
Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees arerecognized at the Company’s po
int-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company hastransferred control o
f the prescription drug and performed all of its performance obligations.For contracts under which the Company 
acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognizedusing the net method.
Drug Discounts
The Company records revenue net o
f manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. TheCompany estimates these
 rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. Theestimates are based on 
the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. TheCompany adjusts its rebates pay
able to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of theseadjustments is recorded a
gainst revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that haveretroactive reba
te adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in theapplicable formulary. The effect
 of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operatingresults or financial 
condition.Guarantees
The Company also adjusts revenues fo
r refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performancemetrics. The inputs to thes
e estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricingand performance refund 
amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.117

Retail/LTC SegmentRetail Pharmacy
The Company’s retail drugstor
es recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is itsown arrangement with
 the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements.Revenues are adjusted for r
efunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service andperformance metrics. The inp
uts to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated andactual pricing and per
formance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Revenue from Company gift cards pu
rchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to beredeemed by customers (
i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.Customer returns are not m
aterial to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.Loyalty and Other Programs
The Company’s customer loyalty p
rogram, ExtraCare, consists of two components, ExtraSavings  and ExtraBucks  Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that arerecorded as a reduction o
f revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods orservices at the time of iss
uance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.ExtraBucks Rewards are accumul
ated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additionalperformance obligation to t
hose customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and theExtraBucks Rewards transaction bas
ed upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocatedto ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized 
as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contractliability.
The Company also offers a subscrip
tion-based membership program, CarePass, under which members are en titled to a suite of benefits delivered over the courseof the subscription period, as we
ll as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annualbasis at the time of or 
in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performanceobligations are satisfied.
Long-term Care
Revenue is recognized when contro
l of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expectsto be entitled to rec
eive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separateand distinct from other 
prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of Long-term Care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical andmedical products is re
imbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues andreceivables from these reimburseme
nt sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenuerecognition date to prope
rly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the totalrevenues and receivables re
ported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from thesepayors.
Patient co-payments assoc
iated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not collected atthe time products are d
elivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accountsreceivable colle
ctions procedures.Walk-In Medical Clinics
For services provided by the Company’s wa
lk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments takenfor third party payor c
ontractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.Health Care Benefits Segment
Health Care Benefits revenu
e is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,which reflect contracted rates 
per employee and the number of covered employees®TM ® ®
118

recorded in the Company’s records at the time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month.The Company’s billings may be subsequen
tly adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known asretroactivity adjus
tments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As informationregarding actual re
troactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in whichthey arise.
Premium Revenue
Premiums are recognized as
 revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance forestimated terminations and u
ncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements of thePatient Protection and Afford
able Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”) is recorded net ofthe estimated minimum MLR
 rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reportedas other insurance liab
ilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.Some of the Company’s contracts 
allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustmentsare reasonably estimable at the
 outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under thecontract and the terms of t
he underlying contract.Services Revenue
Services revenue rela
tes to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct andaccounted for as separa
te performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange forperforming certain 
claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of theCompany’s administrative
 services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processingaccuracy and claim processin
g turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. Withany of these guarantees, th
e Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically islimited to a percen
tage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the termsof these guarantees and
 records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.Accounting for Medicare Par
t DRevenues include insurance pr
emiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangementswith the U.S. Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDPmember, and can be subsidiz
ed by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initiallyrecorded within other i
nsurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.Revenues also include a risk-sh
aring feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable considerationin the form of amounts payab
le to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be receivedfrom or owed to CMS at the end of the r
eporting year.In addition to Medicare Pa
rt D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies a
nd coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference isrecorded in either a
ccounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.119

Cost of products sold includes: (i
) the cost of prescription drugs sold during the reporting period directly through the Company’s mail service dispensingpharmacies and indire
ctly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network, (ii) shipping and handling costs, and (iii) the operating costs of the Company’s mailservice dispensing pharma
cies and client service operations and related information technology support costs including depreciation and amortization. The cost ofprescription drugs sold componen
t of cost of products sold includes: (i) the cost of the prescription drugs purchased from manufacturers or distributors and shippedto members in clients
’ benefit plans from the Company’s mail service dispensing pharmacies, net of any volume-related or other discounts (see “VendorAllowances and Purchase Discounts” below) 
and (ii) the cost of prescription drugs sold (including retail co-payments) through the Company’s retail pharmacynetwork under contracts where 
the Company is the principal, net of any volume-related or other discounts.Retail/LTC Segment
Cost of products sold includes: the 
cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period, including prescription drug costs, and the related purchasing costs,warehousing and delivery costs (
including depreciation and amortization) and actual and estimated inventory losses.Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts
The Company accounts for vendor al
lowances and purchase discounts as follows:®®
 
 
121

Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segmen
t receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalersand retail pharmac
ies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, ofthe following forms: (i) 
a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectlyfrom a manufacture
r (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized whenprescriptions are dispens
ed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect ofadjustments resulting f
rom the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company’s operating results orfinancial condition. The Comp
any accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed.The Pharmacy Services segmen
t also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition,the Pharmacy Services 
segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service feesare recorded as a redu
ction of cost of products sold.Retail/LTC Segment
Vendor allowances received by 
the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the relatedinventory is sold, unless they ar
e specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amountsthat are directly linked to a
dvertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the relatedadvertising commitm
ent is satisfied. Any amounts received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of anyupfront payments received
 from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost ofproducts sold over the life o
f the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked topurchase commitments 
is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of therelated contract. The total amortizati
on of these upfront payments was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in any of the periodspresented.
Health Care Reform
Health Insurer Fee
Since January 1, 2014, the ACA has imposed an annual p
remium-based health insurer fee (“HIF”) for each calendar year, payable in September, which was notdeductible for tax purposes. Th
e Company has been required to estimate a liability for the HIF at the beginning of the calendar year in which the fee was payablewith a corresponding deferr
ed asset that was amortized ratably to operating expenses over the calendar year. The Company recorded the liability for the HIF inaccrued expenses and reco
rded the deferred asset in other current assets. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, operating expenses included $1.0 billionand $157 million, respectiv
ely, related to the Company’s share of the HIF. There was no expense related to the HIF in 2019, since there was a one-year suspensionof the HIF for 2019. In December 2019, the HIF was r
epealed for calendar years after 2020.Risk Adjustment
The ACA established a permanent r
isk adjustment program to transfer funds from qualified individual and small group insurance plans with below average riskscores to plans with above aver
age risk scores. Based on the risk of the Company’s qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of otherqualified plans in compa
rable markets, as defined by the ACA, the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable (recorded in accounts receivable) orpayable (recorded in accrued
 expenses) for the current calendar year and reflects the pro-rata year-to-date impact as an adjustment to premium revenue.Risk Corridor
The ACA established a temporary r
isk corridor program, which expired at the end of 2016, for qualified individual and small group health insurance plans. Underthis program, health insur
ance companies were to make payments to, or receive payments from, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”)based on their ratio of a
llowable costs to target costs (as defined by the ACA).The Company filed a lawsuit in August 2019 to 
recover the $313 million it was owed under the ACA’s risk corridor program, which had been stayed pending theSupreme Court decision. In April 2020, th
e U.S. Supreme Court ruled that health insurance companies may sue the federal government for amounts owed ascalculated under the ACA’s te
mporary risk corridor program.122

In October 2020, the Company received the $313 million it was owed under the ACA’s risk corridor program. The Company recorded the risk corridor payment asan increase to premiu
m revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. After considering offsetting items such as the ACA’s minimum MLR rebate requirementsand premium taxes, the Company 
recorded pre-tax income of $307 million and after-tax income of $223 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.At December 31, 2019, the Company did not re
cord any ACA risk corridor receivables because payment was uncertain.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs, which are redu
ced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed when the related advertising takes place. Net advertising costs, which areincluded in operating expens
es, were $461 million, $396 million and $364 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is m
easured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of thestock award (generally 
three  to five years) using the st raight-line method.Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income 
taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expectedfuture tax consequences of 
events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities aredetermined on the basis of 
the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect forthe year or years in 
which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in the tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized inincome in the period tha
t includes the enactment date of such change.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enact
ed on December 22, 2017. Among numerous changes to existing tax laws, the TCJA permanently reduced thefederal corporate 
income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax balances are required to be takeninto consideration in the p
eriod in which the changes are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rateunder the TCJA, the Company estimated 
the revaluation of its net deferred tax liabilities and recorded a provisional income tax benefit of approximately$1.5 billion for year ended Dec
ember 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company completed its process of determining the TCJA’s final impact and recorded an additionalincome tax benefit of $100 
million.The Company recognizes defer
red tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, theCompany considers
 all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxableincome, tax planning stra
tegies, and the Company’s recent operating results. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it does not consider it morelikely than not that a de
ferred tax asset will be recovered.The Company records uncertain 
tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the taxpositions will be sustained on the b
asis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognitionthreshold, the Com
pany recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxauthority.
Interest and/or penalties related
 to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision.Measurement of Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretir
ement Employee Benefit PlansThe Company sponsors defined benefit p
ension plans (“pension plans”) and other postretirement employee benefit plans (“OPEB plans”) for its employees andretirees. The Company recogn
izes the funded status of its pension and OPEB plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on the year-end measurements of planassets and benefit obliga
tions. When the fair value of plan assets are in excess of the plan benefit obligations, the amounts are reported in other current assets andother assets. When the fa
ir value of plan benefit obligations are in excess of plan assets, the amounts are reported in accrued expenses and other long-termliabilities based on th
e amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation exceeds the fairvalue of plan assets. The net p
eriodic benefit cost (income) for the Company’s pension and OPEB plans do not contain a service cost component as these planshave been frozen for an ex
tended123

period of time. Non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (income) are included in other income in the consolidatedstatements of operations.
Earnings (Loss) per Common Share
Earnings (loss) per share is 
computed using the two-class method. The Company calculates basic earnings (loss) per share based on the weighted average numberof common shares outstanding fo
r the period. See Note 14 ‘‘Earnings (Loss) Per Share’’ for additional information.Shares Held in Trust
The Company maintains grantor 
trusts, which held approximately one million shares of its common stock at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. These shares aredesignated for use under var
ious employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic anddiluted shares outstanding.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company has
 investments in (i) a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity, (ii) certain hedge fund and private equity investments and (iii) certain real estatepartnerships that are 
considered VIEs. The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it mayvoluntarily contribute 
funds. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers several factors, including whether theCompany has (a) the power to dire
ct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses and theright to receive bene
fits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.Variable Interest Entiti
es - Primary BeneficiaryIn 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, 
Inc. (“Cardinal”) established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC (“Red Oak”), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in whichthe Company and Cardinal each own 50%. The Red Oak 
arrangement has an initial term of 10 years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinalcontributed their sourc
ing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companiesthrough Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on b
ehalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) werecontributed to Red Oak by either 
company, and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. The Company has determined that it is the primarybeneficiary of this VIE be

the Company 39 quarterly payments beginning in October 2014. As milestones are met, the quarterly payments increase. The Companyreceived from Cardina

es - Other Variable Interest HolderThe Company has invested in cert
ain VIEs for which it has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary, consisting of the following:•
Hedge fund and private equity investments - The Company invests in hedge fund and pr ivate equity investments in order to generate investment returns for itsinvestment portfolio suppor
ting its insurance businesses.•
Real estate partnerships - The Company invests in various re al estate partnerships, including those that construct, own and manage low-income housingdevelopments. For the low income hous
ing development investments, substantially all of the projected benefits to the Company are from tax credits and othertax benefits.
The Company is not the primary ben
eficiary of these VIEs because the nature of the Company’s involvement with the activities of these VIEs does not give theCompany the power to direct the 
activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. The Company records the amount of its investment in theseVIEs as long-term investmen
ts on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes its share of each VIE’s income or losses in net income (loss). The Company’smaximum exposure to loss fro
m these VIEs is limited to its investment balances as disclosed below and the risk of recapture of previously recognized tax creditsrelated to the rea
l estate partnerships, which the Company does not consider significant.124

The total amount of other variable interest holder VIE assets included in long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019was as follows:

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Ins
trumentsIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting St
andards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  (Topic 326). This standard requi resthe use of a forward-looking exp
ected credit loss impairment model for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments.This standard also re
quires impairments and recoveries for available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance account and revises certaindisclosure requiremen
ts. The Company adopted this new accounting standard on January 1, 2020. The Company adopted the credit loss impairment model on amodified retrospect
ive basis and recorded a $3 million cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings as of the adoption date. The Company adopted theavailable-for-sa
le debt security impairment model on a prospective125

basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated operating results, cash flows or financial condition.Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs In
curred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service ContractIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and other - Int ernal-Use Software (Topic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement tha
t is a Service Contract. This standard requires a cus tomer in a cloud computing arrangementthat is a service cont
ract to follow the internal-use software guidance in Topic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets. TheCompany adopted this new accounting guid
ance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on theCompany’s consolidated operat
ing results, cash flows, financial condition or related disclosures.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Simplifying the Accounting for 
Income TaxesIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, 
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). This standard simpl ifies the accounting for incometaxes by eliminating c
ertain exceptions to the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740 related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation,the methodology for calcu
lating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard alsosimplifies aspects of 
the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-upin the tax basis of goodwill. The Company 
adopted this new accounting standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impacton the Company’s consolidated oper
ating results, cash flows, financial condition or related disclosures.Targeted Improvements to the Accounting 
for Long-Duration Insurance ContractsIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12, 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (Topic 944). This standard requi res theCompany to review cash flow assumptions 
for its long-duration insurance contracts at least annually and recognize the effect of changes in future cash flowassumptions in net income. This s
tandard also requires the Company to update discount rate assumptions quarterly and recognize the effect of changes in theseassumptions in other compreh
ensive income. The rate used to discount the Company’s liability for future policy benefits will be based on an estimate of the yieldfor an upper-medium grad
e fixed-income instrument with a duration profile matching that of the Company’s liabilities. In addition, this standard changes theamortization method 
for deferred acquisition costs and requires additional disclosures regarding the long duration insurance contract liabilities in the Company’sinterim and annual fin
ancial statements. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginningafter December 15, 2022. The Company 
is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of this standard will have on the Company’s consolidated operatingresults, cash flows, financi
al condition and related disclosures.2.
Acquisitions and DivestituresAcquisition of Aetna
On the Aetna Acquisition Date, the Company 
acquired 100% of the outstanding shares and voting interests of Aetna for a combination of cash and stock. Under theterms of the merger 
agreement, Aetna shareholders received $145.00 in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. The transaction valued Aetna atapproximately $212 per shar
e or approximately $70 billion. Including the assumption of Aetna’s debt, the total value of the transaction was approximately $78billion. The Company financed th
e cash portion of the purchase price through a combination of cash on hand and by issuing approximately $45 billion of new debt,including senior notes and te
rm loans. The Company acquired Aetna to help improve the consumer health care experience by combining Aetna’s health carebenefits products and servi
ces with CVS Health’s more than 9,900 retail locations, approximately 1,100 walk-in medical clinics and integrated pharmacycapabilities with the go
al of becoming the new, trusted front door to health care.126

The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumedto be recognized at the
ir fair values at the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at thedate of acquisition:

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the available-for-sale debt security impairment model under ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments -Credit Losses  (Topic 326). The new impairment model requires the write down of amortized cost through an allowance for credit losses, rather than through a reduction of the amortized cost bas
is of the available-for-sale debtsecurity. There was no allowance for credit losses recorded on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2020. As the Company adopted the new available-for-sale debt security
impairment model on a prospective basis, there was no allowance for credit losses recorded on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2019.

current and future property cash flow, property condition, market trends, creditworthiness of the borrower and deal structure.•
Category 1 - Represents loans of superior qua lity.•
Categories 2 to 4 - Represent loans where cred it risk is minimal to acceptable; however, these loans may display some susceptibility to economic changes.•
Categories 5 and 6 - Represent loans where cred it risk is not substantial, but these loans warrant management’s close attention.•
Category 7 - Represents loans  where collections are potentially at risk; if necessary, an impairment is recorded.132

Fair ValueThe preparation of the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires certain assets and liabilities to be reflected at their fairvalue and others to be ref
lected on another basis, such as an adjusted historical cost basis. In this note, the Company provides details on the fair value of financialassets and liabiliti
es and how it determines those fair values. The Company presents this information for those financial instruments that are measured at fair valuefor which the change in fai
r value impacts net income (loss) attributable to CVS Health or other comprehensive income separately from other financial assets andliabilities.
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
Certain of the Company’s finan
cial instruments are measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of these instruments are based onvaluations that include 
inputs that can be classified within one of three levels of a hierarchy established by GAAP.  The following are the levels of the hierarchyand a brief description 
of the type of valuation information (“valuation inputs”) that qualifies a financial asset or liability for each level:•
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•
Level 2 – Valuation inputs other than Level 1 that are based on observable market data. These include: quoted prices for similar assets in active markets,quoted prices for identical
 assets in inactive markets, valuation inputs that are observable that are not prices (such as interest rates and credit risks) andvaluation inputs that ar
e derived from or corroborated by observable markets.•
Level 3 – Developed from unobservable data, reflecting the Company’s assumptions.Financial assets and liab
ilities are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the valuation. When quoted prices in active markets foridentical assets and liabilities
 are available, the Company uses these quoted market prices to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and classifiesthese assets and liabil
ities in Level 1. In other cases where a quoted market price for identical assets and liabilities in an active market is either not available or notobservable, the Company estim
ates fair value using valuation methodologies based on available and observable market information or by using a matrix pricingmodel. These financial 
assets and liabilities are classified in Level 2. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company determines fair value using brokerquotes or an internal ana
lysis of each investment’s financial performance and cash flow projections. Thus, financial assets and liabilities may be classified in Level3 even though there may be some s
ignificant inputs that may be observable.The following is a description o
f the valuation methodologies used for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, including thegeneral classific
ation of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.Cash and Cash Equivalents 
–  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Whenquoted prices are available i
n an active market, cash equivalents are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair values of cash equivalentinstruments that do not tr
ade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.Debt Securities
 –  Where quoted prices are available in an active market, debt securities are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. TheCompany’s Level 1 debt securit
ies consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities.134

The fair values of the Company’s Level 2 debt securities are obtained using models, such as matrix pricing, which use quoted market prices of debtsecurities with simil
ar characteristics or discounted cash flows to estimate fair value. The Company reviews these prices to ensure they are based onobservable market inputs
 that include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets and inputsthat are observable th
at are not prices (such as interest rates and credit risks). The Company also reviews the methodologies and the assumptions used tocalculate prices 
from these observable inputs. On a quarterly basis, the Company selects a sample of its Level 2 debt securities’ prices and compares themto prices provided by a seconda
ry source. Variances over a specified threshold are identified and reviewed to confirm the price provided by the primarysource represents an ap
propriate estimate of fair value. In addition, the Company’s internal investment team consistently compares the prices obtained forselect Level 2 debt secu
rities to the team’s own independent estimates of fair value for those securities. The Company obtained one price for each of itsLevel 2 debt securities 
and did not adjust any of those prices at December 31, 2020 or 2019.The Company also values certa
in debt securities using Level 3 inputs. For Level 3 debt securities, fair values are determined by outside brokers or, in thecase of certain private placement 
securities, are priced internally. Outside brokers determine the value of these debt securities through a combination oftheir knowledge of the curr
ent pricing environment and market flows. The Company did not have any broker quoted debt securities for the years endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2019. For some privat
e placement securities, the Company’s internal staff determines the value of these debt securities byanalyzing spreads of corpor
ate and sector indices as well as interest spreads of comparable public bonds. Examples of these private placement Level 3debt securities include certain
 U.S. and foreign securities and certain tax-exempt municipal securities.Equity Securities
 –  The Company currently has two classifications of equity securities: those that are publicly traded and those that are privatelyplaced. Publicly-traded e
quity securities are classified in Level 1 because quoted prices are available for these securities in an active market. For privatelyplaced equity securities, t
here is no active market; therefore, these securities are classified in Level 3 because the Company prices these securities throughan internal analysis of 
each investment’s financial statements and cash flow projections. Significant unobservable inputs consist of earnings and revenuemultiples, discount for l
ack of marketability and comparability adjustments. An increase or decrease in any of these unobservable inputs would haveresulted in a change in
 the fair value measurement.135

There were no financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 or 2019. Financial assetsmeasured at fair va

Separate Accounts Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
Separate Accounts assets re
late to the Company’s large case pensions products which represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contractholders. Since contract hold
ers bear the investment risk of these assets, a corresponding Separate Accounts liability has been established equal to the assets. Theseassets and liabiliti
es are carried at fair value. Net investment income and capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets accrue directly to such contractholders. The assets of each a
ccount are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company’s other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals, netinvestment income and r
ealized and unrealized capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations,shareholders’ equity or c
ash flows.Separate Accounts assets inc
lude debt and equity securities. The valuation methodologies used for these assets are similar to the methodologies described above inthis Note 4 ‘‘Fair 
Value.’’ Separate Accounts assets also include investments in common/collective trusts that are carried at fair value. Common/collective trustsinvest in other investmen
t funds otherwise known as the underlying funds. The Separate Accounts’ interests in the common/collective trust funds are based on thefair values of the inves
tments of the underlying funds and therefore are classified in Level 2. The assets in the underlying funds primarily consist of equitysecurities. Investmen
ts in common/collective trust funds are valued at their respective net asset value (“NAV”) per share/unit on the valuation date.(1)(1)

$ 23,615 $ 10,807 $ 45,130 $ 79,552 During the year ended Decembe
r 31, 2020, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by the divestiture of the Workers’ Compensationbusiness, partially offse
t by goodwill associated with immaterial acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in the carrying amount ofgoodwill was primarily driven by pu
rchase accounting adjustments associated with the Aetna Acquisition. See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions and Divestitures’’ for furtherdiscussion regarding the Work
ers’ Compensation business divestiture and the Aetna Acquisition.During 2019, the Company also realigned 
the composition of its segments to correspond with changes to its operating model and to reflect how the Chief OperatingDecision Maker (the “CODM”) revi
ews information and manages the business. As a result of this realignment, the Company reallocated the associated goodwillbalance to the Pharmacy Se
rvices and Health Care Benefits segments based on a relative fair value approach.Goodwill Impairment
During the third quarter of bo
th 2020 and 2019, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of these impairment testsindicated that ther
e was no impairment of goodwill. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, cumulative goodwill impairments were $6.1 billion.(1)_____________________________________________

The LTC reporting unit has experienced industry-wide challenges that have impacted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originallyestimated when the Company acqu
ired Omnicare, Inc. (“Omnicare”) in 2015. Those challenges include lower client retention rates, lower occupancy rates inskilled nursing facili
ties, the deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in2018, and continued facility 
reimbursement pressures.Following the update of its curr
ent and long-term forecasts in June 2018, management determined that there were indicators that the LTC reporting unit’s goodwillmay be impaired and, ac
cordingly, management performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2018. The results of that interim impairment testshowed that the fair value o
f the LTC reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in a $3.9 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in the secondquarter of 2018.
During the third quarter of 2018, 
the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill ortrade names.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, 
the LTC reporting unit missed its forecast primarily due to operational issues and customer liquidity issues, including onesignificant customer b
ankruptcy. Additionally, LTC management submitted updated projected financial results which showed significant additional deteriorationprimarily due to continu
ed industry and operational challenges including lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities, significant deterioration in the financialhealth of numerous skilled nu
rsing facility customers and continued facility reimbursement pressures. Based on these updated projections, management determinedthat there were indic
ators that the LTC reporting unit’s goodwill may be further impaired and, accordingly, management performed an interim goodwillimpairment test dur
ing the fourth quarter of 2018. The results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower thanthe carrying value, resu
lting in an additional $2.2 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018.As of December 31, 2020, the remain
ing goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit was $431 million.Intangible Assets

The Company leases
 most of its retail stores and mail order facilities and certain distribution centers and corporate offices under operating or finance leases,typically with initia
l terms of 15 to 25 years. The Company also leases certain equipment and other assets under operating or finance leases, typically with initialterms of 3 to 10 years
. In addition, the Company leases ph
armacy space at the stores of another retail chain for which the noncancelable contractual term of the pharmacy leasearrangement exceeds the remainin
g estimated economic life of the buildings. For these pharmacy lease arrangements, the Company concluded that for accountingpurposes the lease term was 
the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings. Consequently, most of these individual pharmacy leases are finance leases.The following table is a summ

The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target Corporation. Amounts related to such finance and operating leases are reflected above. Pharmacy lease amoun ts due in excessof the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings of approxima
tely $2.3 billion are not reflected in this table since the estimated economic life of the buildings is shorter than thecontractual term of the pharmacy lease arrangement.
Sale-Leaseback Transactions
The Company finances a portion of 
its store development program through sale-leaseback transactions. The properties are generally sold at net book value, whichgenerally approximat
es fair value, and the resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. The operating leases that resulted from thesetransactions are inc
luded in the tables above.(1)(2)

The Company does not have any retained or contingent interests in the stores and does not provide any guarantees, other than a guarantee of lease payments, inconnection with the sale-
leaseback transactions. Proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions totaled $101 million and $5 million in the years ended December 31,2020 and 2019, respectively. Gains fro
m sale-leaseback transactions totaled $3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.  There were no material gains fromsale-leaseback tr
ansactions in the year ended December 31, 2019.Store Rationalization Charges
During the first quarter o
f 2019, the Company performed a review of its retail stores and determined it would close 46 underperforming retail pharmacy storesduring the second quarter of 2019. As a 
result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores, including theassociated operating lease ri
ght-of-use assets. Accordingly, an interim long-lived asset impairment test was performed. The results of the impairment test indicatedthat the fair value o
f each store asset group was lower than the carrying value. The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow method based onestimated sublease in
come. In the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a store rationalization charge of $135 million, primarily related tothese operating lease 
right-of-use asset impairment charges, which was recorded within operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment.During the third quarter of 2019, 
in connection with its annual budgeting process, the Company performed an updated review of its retail stores and determined itwould close an additional 22 underp
erforming retail pharmacy stores during the first quarter of 2020. As a result, management determined that there wereindicators of impair
ment with respect to the impacted stores, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets. Accordingly, an interim long-lived assetimpairment test was pe
rformed. The results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of each store asset group was lower than the carrying value. The fairvalue was determined using a d
iscounted cash flow method based on estimated sublease income. In the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Companyrecorded a store rationalization
 charge of $96 million, primarily related to these operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges, which was recorded withinoperating expenses in the Ret
ail/LTC segment.Comparative Disclosure Prior to the Adoption of the New Lease Ac

about incurred and cumulative paid health care claims development as of December 31, 2020, net of reinsurance, and the total IBNRliabilities plus expe
cted development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims amounts. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ forinformation on how the Company esti
mates IBNR reserves and health care costs payable as well as changes to those methodologies, if any. The Company’sestimate of IBNR liabili
ties is primarily based on trend and completion factors. Claim frequency is not used in the calculation of the Company’s liability. Inaddition, it is impracticable t
o disclose claim frequency information for health care claims due to the Company’s inability to gather consistent claim frequencyinformation across its 
multiple claims processing systems. Any claim frequency count disclosure would not be comparable across the Company’s different claimprocessing systems and would not be consis
tent from period to period based on the volume of claims processed through each system. As a result, health care claimcount frequency is not includ
ed in the disclosures below.The information about incu
rred and paid health care claims development for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented as required unaudited supplementalinformation.

As of the Aetna Acquisition Date, the Company reclassified $776 million of the Pharmacy Services segmen t’s unpaid retail pharmacy claims to third parties from pharmacy claims anddiscounts payable to health care costs payable as the third party liabi
lity was incurred to support the Health Care Benefits segment’s insured members.(2)
Total incurred health care costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 in the table above exclude (i) $11 million, $4 mil lion and $16 million, respectively, for a premiumdeficiency reserve related to the Company’s Medicaid products, (ii) $41 million, $41 mi
llion and $4 million, respectively, of benefit costs recorded in the Health Care Benefits segment thatare included in other insurance liabilities on the consolida
ted balance sheets and (iii) $221 million, $285 million and $22 million, respectively, of benefit costs recorded in theCorporate/Other segment that are included in other insurance liabilit
ies on the consolidated balance sheets.The Company’s estimates of pr
ior years’ health care costs payable decreased by $429 million and $524 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, because claimswere settled for amounts 
less than originally estimated (i.e., the amount of claims incurred was lower than originally estimated), primarily due to lower health carecost trends as well as the a
ctual claim submission time being faster than originally assumed (i.e., the Company’s completion factors were higher than originallyassumed) in estimating h
ealth care costs payable at the end of the prior year. This development does not directly correspond to an increase in the Company’soperating results as thes
e reductions were offset by estimated current period health care costs when the Company established the estimate of the current year healthcare costs payable.

The Company uses a series of actu
arial assumptions to determine its benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost (income), the most significant of which includediscount rates and expect
ed return on plan assets assumptions.Discount Rates
 -  The discount rate is determined using a yield curve as of the annual measurement date. The yield curve consists of a series of individualdiscount rates, with each dis
count rate corresponding to a single point in time, based on high-quality bonds. Projected benefit payments are discounted tothe measurement date using
 the corresponding rate from the yield curve that is consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows.Expected Return on Plan Assets
 -  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the plan’s target allocation and returnexpectations based on many f
actors including forecasted long-term capital market real returns and the inflationary outlook on a plan by plan basis. See“Pension Plan Assets” below for addition
al details regarding the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.The Company also considers other assu
mptions including mortality, interest crediting rate, termination and retirement rates and cost of living adjustments.The Company determined its ben
efit obligation based on the following weighted average assumptions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:2020

Pension Plan AssetsSubsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Dat
e, the Company’s pension plan assets primarily include debt and equity securities held in separate accounts,common/collective 
trusts and real estate investments. The valuation methodologies used to value these debt and equity securities and common/collective trusts aresimilar to the methodo
logies described in Note 4 “Fair Value.” Pension plan assets also include investments in other assets that are carried at fair value. Thefollowing is a description of 
the valuation methodologies used to value real estate investments and these additional investments, including the general classificationpursuant to the fair valu
e hierarchy.Real Estate
 - Real estate investm ents are valued by independent third party appraisers. The appraisals comply with the Uniform Standards of ProfessionalAppraisal Practice, which in
clude, among other things, the income, cost, and sales comparison approaches to estimating property value. Therefore, theseinvestments are class
ified in Level 3.Private equity and hedge fund l
imited partnerships - Private equity and  hedge fund limited partnerships are carried at fair value which is estimated usingthe NAV per unit as reported by the ad
ministrator of the underlying investment fund as a practical expedient to fair value. Therefore, these investmentshave been excluded from
 the fair value table below.Pension plan assets with changes in f

$ 353 $ 1 $354 The Company’s pension plan invests in a d
iversified mix of assets designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future benefit obligations. Therisk of unexpected investm
ent and actuarial outcomes is regularly evaluated. This evaluation is performed through forecasting and assessing ranges of investmentoutcomes over short- and long-
term horizons and by assessing the pension plan’s liability characteristics. Complementary investment styles and strategies areutilized by professional
 investment management firms to further improve portfolio and operational risk characteristics. Public and private equity investments areused primarily to increase 
overall plan returns. Real estate investments are viewed favorably for their diversification benefits and above-average dividendgeneration. Fixed inc
ome investments provide diversification benefits and liability hedging attributes that are desirable, especially in falling interest rateenvironments.
At December 31, 2020, target inves
tment allocations for the Company’s pension plan were: 20% in equity securities, 68% in fixed income and debt securities, 6%in real estate, 3% in p
rivate equity limited partnerships and 3% in hedge funds. Actual asset allocations may differ from target allocations due to tactical decisionsto overweight or underweight ce
rtain assets or as a result of normal fluctuations in asset values. Asset allocations are consistent with stated investment policies and,as a general rule, periodicall
y rebalanced back to target asset allocations. Asset allocations and investment performance are formally reviewed periodicallythroughout the year by the pension p
lan’s Investment Subcommittee. Forecasting of asset and liability growth is performed at least annually.Cash Flows
The Company generally contribu
tes to its tax-qualified pension plan based on minimum funding requirements determined under applicable federal laws andregulations. Employer cont
ributions related to the nonqualified supplemental pension plans generally represent payments to retirees for current benefits. TheCompany contributed $25 million, $25 
million and $12 million to its pension plans during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No contributions are required for thetax-qualified pension pl
an in 2021. The Company expects to make an immaterial amount of contributions for all other pension plans in 2021. The Companyestimates the following 
future benefit payments, which are calculated using the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the pension benefit obligation as ofDecember 31, 2020:

1,807 Multiemployer Pension Plans
The Company also contributes to a nu
mber of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-representedemployees. The risks of part
icipating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following respects: (i) assets contributedto the multiemployer p
lan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer stopscontributing to the plan, th
e unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if the Company chooses to stopparticipating in some o
f its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the applicableplan, which is referred to 
as a withdrawal liability.153

None of the multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates are individually significant to the Company. The Company’s contributions tomultiemployer pension pl
ans were $19 million, $18 million and $18 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company provides postretire
ment health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees who meet eligibility requirements. During 2018, the Companyacquired additional OPEB plans in conn
ection with the Aetna Acquisition. The Company’s funding policy is generally to pay covered expenses as they areincurred. For retiree 
medical plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health carecost trend rates. As of Decemb
er 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s other postretirement benefits had an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $226million and $246 million, r
espectively. Net periodic benefit costs related to these other postretirement benefits were $12 million, $7 million and $2 million in 2020,2019 and 2018, respectively.

mployer health and welfare plans totaled $54 million, $57 million and $58 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.10.

fective on January 1, 2018. The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax balances are required to be taken into consideration in theperiod in which the changes ar
e enacted, regardless of when they are effective. As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate under the TCJA, theCompany estimated the rev
aluation of its net deferred tax liabilities and recorded a provisional income tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion for154

$ 768 $ 655 $ 661 The increase in the bal
ance of unrecognized tax benefits during 2018 was mainly due to the Aetna Acquisition.The Company and most of its subsidiar
ies are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of numerous state and local jurisdictions. The Companyparticipated in the Comp
liance Assurance Process through 2019, which is a program made available by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to certainqualifying large taxpay
ers, under which participants work collaboratively with the IRS to identify and resolve potential tax issues through open, cooperative andtransparent intera
ction prior to the annual filing of their federal income tax returns. The IRS has completed its examinations of the Company’s consolidated U.S.federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2013 and 2018. The IRS has substantially completed its examinations of the Company’s consolidated U.S. federal incometax returns for tax yea
rs 2014 through 2017 and 2019.The Company and its subsidiaries a
re also currently under income tax examinations by a number of state and local tax authorities. As of December 31, 2020, noexamination has result
ed in any proposed adjustments that would result in a material change to the Company’s operating results, financial condition or liquidity.Substantially all mat
erial state and local income tax matters have been concluded for fiscal years through 2014. Certain state exams are likely to be concluded andcertain state sta
tutes of limitations will lapse in 2021, but the change in the balance of the Company’s uncertain tax positions is projected to be immaterial. Inaddition, it is reasonably poss
ible that the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits could change within the next twelve months due to the anticipated conclusion ofvarious examinations with th
e IRS for various years. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time.The Company records interest 
expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in the income tax provision. The Company accrued interest expense ofapproximately $34 mill
ion, $49 million and $19 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had approximately $121 million and $173 millionaccrued for interes
t and penalties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.As of December 31, 2020, the total a
mount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate is approximately$651 million, after con
sidering the federal benefit of state income taxes.11.
Stock Incentive PlansThe terms of the CVS Health 2017 Incent
ive Compensation Plan (“ICP”) provide for grants of annual incentive and long-term performance awards to executiveofficers and other off
icers and employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, as well as equity compensation to outside directors of CVS Health.Payment of such annual incent
ive and long-term performance awards will be in cash, stock, other awards or other property, at the discretion of the ManagementPlanning and Development Committ
ee (the “MP&D Committee”) of CVS Health’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The ICP allows for a maximum of 58 millionshares of CVS Health common stock to be r
eserved and available for grants. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 38 million shares of CVS Healthcommon stock available 
for future grants under the ICP.As of the Aetna Acquisition Date, approx
imately 22 million shares of Aetna common stock subject to awards outstanding under the Amended Aetna Inc. 2010Stock Incentive Plan (“SIP”) wer
e assumed by CVS Health. In addition, in accordance with the merger agreement, shares which were available for future issuanceunder the SIP were converted into 
approximately 32 million shares of CVS Health common stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to future awards.Subsequent to the
156

expiration of the SIP on May 21, 2020, the ICP is the only compensation plan under which the Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to its employees.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation is m
easured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of thestock award (generally 
three  to five years) using the st raight-line method. The following table is a summary of stock-based compensation for the years endedDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $14 million and $27 million assoc iated with accelerated vesting of SARs and restricted stock replacementawards, respectively, issued to Aetna employees who were terminated subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition.
ESPP
The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
(“ESPP”) provides for the purchase of up to 60 million shares of CVS Health common stock. Under the ESPP,eligible employees m
ay purchase common stock at the end of each six month offering period at a purchase price equal to 90% of the lower of the fair market valueon the first day or the las
t day of the offering period. During 2020, approximately 3 million shares of common stock were purchased under the provisions of theESPP at an average price of $53.85 per sh
are. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 34 million shares of common stock were available for issuance under theESPP.
The fair value of stock-b
ased compensation associated with the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant (the first day of the six month offering period) using theBlack-Scholes option pricing mod
el.The following table is a summ

The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of CVS Health’s daily stock price over the previous six month period.(3)
The risk-free interest rate is selected based on the Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent wi th the expected term of ESPP purchases (i.e., six months).(4)
The expected life is based on the semi-annual purchase period. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
The Company’s restricted sto
ck units and performance stock units are considered nonvested share awards and require no payment from the employee. The fairvalue of the restric
ted stock units is based on the market price of CVS Health common stock on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over thevesting period. For each rest
ricted stock unit granted, employees receive one share of common stock, net of taxes, at the end of the vesting period.The Company’s performance sto
ck units contain performance vesting conditions in addition to a service vesting condition. Vesting of the Company’s performancestock units is dependent upon the deg
ree to which the Company achieves its performance goals, which are generally set for a three-year performance period and areapproved at the time of g
rant by the MP&D Committee.(1) (2)(2)

The fair value of performance stock units granted with service and performance vesting conditions is based on the market price of CVS Health common stock onthe grant date and is re
cognized over the vesting period. Certain of the performance stock units also contain a market vesting condition based on the performance ofCVS Health common stock relative 
to a comparator group. The fair value of these performance stock units is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of thegrant date and is recogni
zed over the vesting period.On November 28, 2018, the Company completed th

The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options or SARs being valued. (4)
The expected life represents the number of years the options or SARs are expected to be outstanding from grant date based on historical option or SAR holder exercise experience. The increase in the weight

Earnings (Loss) Per ShareEarnings (loss) per share is 
computed using the two-class method. For periods in which the Company reports net income, diluted earnings per share is determinedby using the weighted average numb
er of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive. SARs andoptions to purchase 15 million 
and 17 million shares of common stock were outstanding, but were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share forthe years ended December 31, 2020 
and 2019, respectively, because their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and,therefore, the eff
ect would be antidilutive. For the same reason, options to purchase 13 million shares of common stock were outstanding, but were excluded fromthe calculation of di
luted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, due to the loss from continuing operations attributable to CVSHealth in the year ended Dec
ember 31, 2018, 3 million potentially dilutive common equivalent shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings pershare, as the impact of 
these shares was antidilutive for that period.The following is a reconcil

ReinsuranceThe Company utilizes
 reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance contracts.Ceded reinsurance agree
ments permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s primaryliability as the direct insurer
 of the risks reinsured.On November 30, 2018, the Company completed th
e sale of Aetna’s standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to a subsidiary of WellCare Health Plans,Inc. (“WellCare”), 
effective December 31, 2018. In connection with that sale, subsidiaries of WellCare and Aetna entered into reinsurance agreements under whichWellCare ceded to Aetna 100
% of the insurance risk related to the divested standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans for the 2019 PDP plan year.In February 2021, the Company entered 
into two four-year reinsurance agreements with an unrelated reinsurer that allow it to reduce required capital and providecollateralized 
excess of loss reinsurance coverage on a portion of the Health Care Benefits segment’s group Commercial Insured business.162

any entered into these contracts to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss which in turn reduces the Company’s capital andsurplus requirements. Tota

Commitments and ContingenciesCOVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. 
We believe COVID-19’s impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial conditionprimarily will be driv
en by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies andconsumer behavior and
 health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and localgovernmental responses to th
e pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on ourbusinesses, operating results, 
cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-19 also may result in legaland regulatory proceedings, 
investigations and claims against us.Guarantees
The Company has the following signifi
cant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2020:•
ASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The banksmaintain accounts to fund 
claims of the Company’s ASC customers. The customer is163

responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day. In these arrangements, the Company guarantees that the banks will not sustain losses if theresponsible ASC customer does not proper
ly fund its account. The aggregate maximum exposure under these arrangements is generally limited to $250million. The Company can lim
it its exposure to these guarantees by suspending the payment of claims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded theamount paid by the bank.
•
Separate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent fundsmaintained as a contr
actual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations underlying theguaranteed benefits in 
these Separate Accounts were approximately $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant AccountingPolicies’’ for addition
al information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and mortality risk and are required to maintain SeparateAccounts balances at or above 
a specified level. The level of required funds is a function of the risk underlying the Separate Account’s investment strategy. Ifcontract holders do not ma
intain the required level of Separate Accounts assets to meet the annuity guarantees, the Company would establish an additionalliability. Contract hold
ers’ balances in the Separate Accounts at December 31, 2020 exceeded the value of the guaranteed benefit obligation. As a result, theCompany was not required to maint
ain any additional liability for its related guarantees at December 31, 2020.Lease Guarantees
Between 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a numb
er of subsidiaries, including Bob’s Stores and Linens ‘n Things, each of which subsequently filedfor bankruptcy, and Marshalls. 
In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the former subsidiary’s leaseobligations for the init
ial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. When thesubsidiaries were disposed of and 
accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company’s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser agreed toindemnify the Company for any l
ease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries fail to make therequired payments under a s
tore lease, the Company could be required to satisfy those obligations, and any significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on suchpurchasers and/or forme
r subsidiaries increases the risk that the Company will be required to satisfy those obligations. As of December 31, 2020, the Companyguaranteed 76 such store le
ases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens ‘n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the consolidated balancesheets), with the maximum 
remaining lease term extending through 2030.Guaranty Fund Assessments, Market Stabilization and Other Non-Voluntary Risk Sharing Pools
Under guaranty fund laws existing in 
all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (in most states up to prescribed limits) for certain obligationsof insolvent insurance comp
anies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the Company participates thatoperate under these laws r
espond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers and life insurers as well as health insurers. The Company’s assessments generally arebased on a formula rela
ting to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers. Certain states allow assessments to berecovered over time 
as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors such as not-for-profit consumer-governedhealth plans established und
er the ACA.In 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Com
missioner placed long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries(collectively, “Penn Tr
eaty”) in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and subsequently petitioned a state court to convert the rehabilitation into aliquidation. Penn Treaty was pla
ced in liquidation in March 2017. The Company has recorded a liability for its estimated share of future assessments by applicablelife and health insuran
ce guaranty associations. It is reasonably possible that in the future the Company may record a liability and expense relating to otherinsolvencies which could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows, and the risk is heightened by anysignificant adverse i
mpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the solvency of other insurers, including long-term care and life insurers. While historically theCompany has ultimately re
covered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets, significant increases inassessments could lead to l
egislative and/or regulatory actions that limit future offsets.HMOs in certain states in which th
e Company does business are subject to assessments, including market stabilization and other risk-sharing pools, for which theCompany is assessed charges based on in
curred claims, demographic membership mix and other factors. The Company establishes liabilities for these assessmentsbased on applicable laws and r
egulations. In certain states, the ultimate assessments the Company pays are dependent upon the Company’s experience relative toother entities subjec
t to the assessment, and the ultimate liability is not known at the financial statement date. While the ultimate amount of164

the assessment is dependent upon the experience of all pool participants, the Company believes it has adequate reserves to cover such assessments.The Company’s total guaranty fund 
assessments liability was $78 million and $84 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was recorded inaccrued expenses on the consol
idated balance sheets.Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings
The Company has been involved or is cur
rently involved in numerous legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration, government investigations, audits,reviews and claims. These in
clude routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, stateattorneys general, the U.S. Drug Enfor
cement Administration (the “DEA”) and other governmental authorities.Legal proceedings, in gener
al, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, and governmental special investigations, audits and reviews canbe expensive and disruptive. Some o
f the litigation matters may purport or be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/orindeterminate amoun
ts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. The Company also may be named from time totime in
 qui tam  actions initiated by pr ivate third parties that could also be separately pursued by a governmental body. The results of legal proceedings, includinggovernment investigations, 
are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome.The Company records accruals 
for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.The Company evaluates, on a quart
erly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a losscontingency both probable and r
easonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish anaccrued liability. None o
f the Company’s accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company’s financial condition.Except as otherwise noted, the Comp
any cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, and the Company is unable toreasonably estimate 
a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for these matters. The Company believes that its defenses andassertions in pending legal p
roceedings have merit and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights toindemnification, will h
ave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings, however, dosometimes occur, which could 
result in judgments against the Company, entry into settlements or a revision to its expectations regarding the outcome of certainmatters, and such developm
ents could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations orproceedings, the Company may be subj
ect to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions including possible suspension or loss of licensureand/or exclusion from par
ticipating in government programs. The outcome of such governmental investigations of proceedings could be material to the Company.Usual and Customary Pricing Litiga
tionThe Company and certain curr
ent and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company’s retailpharmacies overcharg
ed for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process. These actions arebrought by a number of differ
ent types of plaintiffs, including plan members, private payors, government payors, and shareholders based on different legal theories.Some of these cases are brough
t as putative class actions, and in some instances, classes have been certified. The Company is defending itself against these claims.PBM Litigation and Investigations
The Company is named as a defendan
t in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its PBM practices.The Company is facing multipl
e lawsuits, including several putative class actions, regarding drug pricing and its rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers.These complaints, brought under 
a variety of legal theories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflatedprices for certain d
rug products. The Company is defending itself against these claims. The Company has also received subpoenas, civil investigative demands(“CIDs”) and
165

other requests for documents and information from, and is being investigated by, Attorneys General of several states and the District of Columbia regarding itsPBM practices, including pric
ing and rebates. The Company has been providing documents and information in response to these subpoenas, CIDs and requests forinformation.
United States ex rel. Behnke 
v. CVS Caremark Corporation, et al. (U.S. District Court for th e Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In April 2018, the Court unsealed acomplaint filed in Febru
ary 2014. The government has declined to intervene in this case. The relator alleges that the Company submitted, or caused to besubmitted, to Part D of the Medi
care program Prescription Drug Event data and/or Direct and Indirect Remuneration reports that misrepresented true prices paid bythe Company’s PBM to pharmacies for d
rugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company’s PBM. The Company isdefending itself agains
t these claims.Controlled Substances Litigat
ion, Audits and SubpoenasIn December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Pane
l on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by plaintiffs such as counties,cities, hospitals, Indian 
tribes and third-party payors, alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread prescription opioid abuse. The consolidatedmultidistrict litigation captioned 
In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804) is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ofOhio. This multidistrict l
itigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases that name the Company as a defendant. A significant number ofsimilar cases that n
ame the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state courts. In addition, the Company has been named as a defendant insimilar cases brought by c
ertain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against all such claims. Additionally, the Company has receivedsubpoenas, CIDs and/or other requests fo
r information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General and insurance and other regulators of several U.S.jurisdictions. The Company has been 
cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas, CIDs and other requests for information.In January 2020, the U.S. Department of Just
ice (the “DOJ”) served the Company with a DEA administrative subpoena. The subpoena seeks documents relating topractices with respec
t to prescription opioids and other controlled substances at CVS Pharmacy locations in connection with an investigation concerning potentialviolations of the feder
al Controlled Substances Act and the federal False Claims Act. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to thissubpoena.
Prescription Processing Litig
ation and InvestigationsU.S. 
ex rel.  Bassan  et al.  v.  Omnicare, Inc. and CVS Health Corp. and U.S. ex rel.  Mohajer  et al.  v.  Omnicare, Inc. and CVS Health Corp. (U.S.  District Court forthe
 Southern District of New York). In December 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (the “SDNY”) filed complaints-in-intervention
 in these two previously sealed qui tam  cases.  With respect to the Bassan  complaint,  all states and Washington, D.C. have declined to intervene at thistime.
 The  government’s  investigation  related  to  these  complaints  included  the  previously  disclosed  CID  that  the  Company  received  in  October  2015  from  theSDNY
 concerning the Company’s Omnicare pharmacies’ cycle fill process for assisted living facilities. The complaints allege that for certain non-skilled nursingfacilities,
 Omnicare improperly filled prescriptions beyond one year where a valid prescription did not exist and that these dispensing events violated the federalFalse
 Claims Act. The Mohajer relators  have amended their complaint to include claims based on similar theories related to certain skilled nursing facilities. TheCompany is defending itself ag
ainst these claims.In July 2017, the Company also receiv
ed a subpoena from the California Department of Insurance requesting documents concerning the Company’s Omnicarepharmacies’ cycle 
fill process for assisted living facilities. The Company has been cooperating with the California Department of Insurance and providingdocuments and information 
in response to this subpoena..In December 2016, the Company rec
eived a CID from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of New York requesting documents and information inconnection with a federa
l False Claims Act investigation concerning whether the Company’s retail pharmacies improperly submitted certain insulin claims to PartD of the Medicare program 
rather than Part B of the Medicare program. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents andinformation in response to 
this CID.Provider Proceedings
The Company is named as a defendan
t in purported class actions and individual lawsuits arising out of its practices related to the payment of claims for servicesrendered to its membe
rs by providers with whom the Company has a contract and with166

whom the Company does not have a contract (“out-of-network providers”). Among other things, these lawsuits allege that the Company paid too little to its healthplan members and/or provid
ers for out-of-network services and/or otherwise allege that the Company failed to timely or appropriately pay or administer out-of-network claims and benefi
ts (including the Company’s post-payment audit and collection practices and reductions in payments to providers due to sequestration).Other major health insurer
s are the subject of similar litigation or have settled similar litigation.The Company also has received subpoen
as and/or requests for documents and other information from, and been investigated by, state Attorneys General and otherstate and/or federa
l regulators, legislators and agencies relating to, and the Company is involved in other litigation regarding, its out-of-network benefit paymentand administration pra
ctices. It is reasonably possible that others could initiate additional litigation or additional regulatory action against the Company withrespect to its out-of-net
work benefit payment and/or administration practices.CMS Actions
CMS regularly audits the Company’s pe
rformance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and to assess the quality ofservices it provides to Med
icare beneficiaries. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate and adjust premium payments to the Company’s and othercompanies’ Medicare p
lans by considering the applicable health status of Medicare members as supported by information prepared, maintained and provided byproviders. The Company collects 
claim and encounter data from providers and generally relies on providers to appropriately code their submissions to theCompany and document their med
ical records, including the diagnosis data submitted to the Company with claims. CMS pays increased premiums to MedicareAdvantage plans and Medicare PDP plans fo
r members who have certain medical conditions identified with specific diagnosis codes. Federal regulators review andaudit the providers’ medical
 records to determine whether those records support the related diagnosis codes that determine the members’ health status and theresulting risk-adjusted p
remium payments to the Company. In that regard, CMS has instituted risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”) audits of variousMedicare Advantage plans, in
cluding certain of the Company’s plans, to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained byproviders and the resulting 
risk adjusted premium payments to the plans. CMS may require the Company to refund premium payments if the Company’s riskadjusted premiums are no
t properly supported by medical record data. The Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services(“HHS-OIG”) also is auditing the Company’s 
risk adjustment-related data and that of other companies. The Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue thesetypes of audits.
In 2012, CMS revised its audit methodology 
for RADV audits to determine refunds payable by Medicare Advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward.Under the revised methodology, a
mong other things, CMS will extrapolate the error rate identified in the audit sample of approximately 200 members to all riskadjusted premium paymen
ts made under the contract being audited. For contract years prior to 2011, CMS did not extrapolate sample error rates to the entirecontract. As a result, the 
revised methodology may increase the Company’s exposure to premium refunds to CMS based on incomplete medical records maintainedby providers. Since 2013, CMS has selected c
ertain of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contracts for various contract years for RADV audit, and the number ofRADV audits continues to increase. The Company 
is currently unable to predict which of its Medicare Advantage contracts will be selected for future audit, theamounts of any retroact
ive refunds of, or prospective adjustments to, Medicare Advantage premium payments made to the Company, the effect of any such refundsor adjustments on the actu
arial soundness of the Company’s Medicare Advantage bids, or whether any RADV audit findings would require the Company to changeits method of estimat
ing future premium revenue in future bid submissions to CMS or compromise premium assumptions made in the Company’s bids for priorcontract years, the cu
rrent contract year or future contract years. Any premium or fee refunds or adjustments resulting from regulatory audits, whether as a result ofRADV, Public Exchange-related or other 
audits by CMS, HHS-OIG or otherwise, including audits of the Company’s MLR rebates, methodology and/or reports,could be material and 
could adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.Medicare and Medicaid CIDs
The Company has received CIDs from th
e Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with a current investigation of the Company’s patient chart review processes inconnection with risk adjustm
ent data submissions under Parts C and D of the Medicare program. The Company has been cooperating with the government andproviding documents and inform
ation in response to these CIDs.In May 2017, the Company received a CID f
rom the SDNY requesting documents and information concerning possible false claims submitted to Medicare inconnection with reimburse
ments for prescription drugs under the Medicare Part D program. The Company has been cooperating with the government andproviding documents and inform
ation in response to this CID.167

In April 2020, the Company received a CID from the Office of the Washington Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Division, on behalf of the State ofWashington and all other st
ates, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The investigation involves, among other things,possible retention of overp
ayments and possible submission of false claims for Medicaid reimbursement relating to drugs prescribed by providers who wereexcluded by the applicabl
e federal and/or state Medicaid programs. The Company is cooperating with the government with respect to this investigation.Stockholder Matters
Beginning in February 2019, multiple 
class action complaints, as well as a derivative complaint were filed by putative plaintiffs against the Company and certaincurrent and former officers an
d directors. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action under federal securities laws that are premised onallegations that the d
efendants made certain omissions and misrepresentations relating to the performance of the Company’s LTC business unit. Since filing,several of the cases have
 been consolidated, and the first-filed federal case, City of Miami Fire Fighters’ and Pol ice Officers’ Retirement Trust, et al. (formerly known as 
Anarkat ), was recently dismissed with p rejudice. The Company and its current and former officers and directors are defending themselves against theseclaims.
In August and September 2020, two ERISA class actions we
re filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut against CVS Health, Aetna, andseveral current and fo
rmer executives, directors and/or members of Aetna’s Compensation and Talent Management Committee: Radcliffe v. Aetna Inc., et al.  andFlaim v. Aetna Inc., 
et al. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action premised on allegations that the defendants breached fiduciary duties andengaged in prohibited trans
actions relating to participants in the Aetna 401(k) Plan’s investment in company stock between December 3, 2017 and February 20,2019, claiming losses rela
ted to the performance of the Company’s LTC business unit. The district court consolidated the actions and the Company has moved todismiss the amended and consol
idated class action complaint. The Company also received a related document request pursuant to ERISA § 104(b), to which theCompany has responded.
Other Legal and Regulatory Proce
edings. The Company is also a party to othe
r legal proceedings and is subject to government investigations, inquiries and audits and has received and is cooperating withthe government in response to CIDs, subpoen
as or similar process from various governmental agencies requesting information. These other legal proceedings andgovernment actions inclu
de claims of or relating to bad faith, medical or professional malpractice, claims processing, dispensing of medications, non-compliancewith state and federal reg
ulatory regimes, marketing misconduct, failure to timely or appropriately pay or administer claims and benefits, provider networkstructure (including th
e use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), rescission of insurance coverage, improper disclosure or use ofpersonal information, antic
ompetitive practices, general contractual matters, product liability, intellectual property litigation and employment litigation. Some ofthese other legal proc
eedings are or are purported to be class actions or derivative claims. The Company is defending itself against the claims brought in thesematters.
Awards to the Company and others of cer
tain government contracts, particularly Medicaid contracts and other contracts with government customers in theCompany’s Health Care Benefits seg
ment, frequently are subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders. These protests may result in awards to the Company beingreversed, delayed or modi
fied. The loss or delay in implementation of any government contract could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. TheCompany will continue to defend con
tract awards it receives.There also continues to be a h
eightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities and legislators of, and increased litigation regarding, the Company’sand the rest of the healt
h care and related benefits industry’s business and reporting practices, including premium rate increases, utilization management,development and applica
tion of medical policies, complaint, grievance and appeal processing, information privacy, provider network structure (including providernetwork adequacy, t
he use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), provider directory accuracy, calculation of minimum medicalloss ratios and/or payment o
f related rebates, delegated arrangements, rescission of insurance coverage, limited benefit health products, student health products,pharmacy benefit management practice
s (including manufacturers’ rebates, pricing, the use of narrow networks and the placement of drugs in formulary tiers),sales practices, custo
mer service practices, vendor oversight and claim payment practices (including payments to out-of-network providers).As a leading national heal

Segment ReportingThe Company has three operating s
egments, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company’ssegments maintain sepa
rate financial information, and the CODM evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resourcesamong the segments and in assess
ing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on adjusted operatingincome which is defined as ope
rating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relateto the ordinary course of th
e Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance. See the reconciliation of consolidated operatingincome (GAAP measure) to adjusted op
erating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjustedoperating income. The Company uses 
adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to comparepast financial perfo
rmance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Companydiscloses, such as consolidated 
adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated inaccordance with GAAP.
In 2020 and 2019, revenues from the f
ederal government accounted for 14% and 13%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total revenues, primarilyrelated to contrac
ts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment. Revenues from the federal governmentwere less than 10% of the Company’s 
consolidated revenues in 2018. In 2018, approximately 9.8% of the Company’s consolidated revenues were from Aetna,which was a Pharmacy Services segm
ent client. On the Aetna Acquisition Date, Aetna became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health. Subsequent to theAetna Acquisition Date, transa
ctions with Aetna continue to be reported within the Pharmacy Services segment, but are eliminated in the Company’sconsolidated financia
l statements.169

The Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks,customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, techno
logy, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimateduseful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may no
t be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s GAAPconsolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segmen
t. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangibleassets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or
services. Additionally, intangible asset amortizat
ion expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believesexcluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the 
Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and toanalyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the
Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has no
t been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible assetamortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike 
the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless anintangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful 
life of an intangible asset is revised.(2)
In 2020, 2019 and 2018, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the Aetna Acquisition. In 2018, acquisition-related integration costs also relate to the acquisition ofOmnicare. The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs are reflected in the Co
mpany’s consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Othersegment and the Retail/LTC segment.
(3)
In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately$850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction in operat
ing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment. In2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the el
imination of thecumulative translation adjustment from accumula
ted other comprehensive income. In 2018, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company’sRxCrossroads subsidiary for $725 million on January 2, 2018. The losses on divestiture of subsidiary are reflected in the Company’s consolidated s
tatements of operations in operatingexpenses within the Retail/LTC segment.

In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the ACA’s risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsettingitems such as the ACA’s minimum MLR rebate requirements and premium taxes, 
the Company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the Company’s consolidated statement ofoperations within the Health Care Benefits segment.
(5)
In 2019, the store rationalization charges relate to the planned closure of 46 underperforming retail pharmacy stores in the second quarter of 2019 and the planned closure of 22underperforming retail pharmacy stores in the first quarter of 2020. The store rationalization charges primarily relate to operating lease right-of-use asset impairmen

’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,CVS Health Corporation (the Company) main
tained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based onthe COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2020 consolidatedfinancial statem
ents of the Company and our report dated February 16, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over
 financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to expressan
 opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and arerequired
 to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PC
AOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective inter
nal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe
 design and operating  effectiveness  of internal  control based on the assessed risk, and performing  such other procedures  as we considered  necessary  in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financia
l ReportingA
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting
 includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of CVS Health CorporationOpinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the relatedconsolidated statemen
ts of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2020, and the rela
ted notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statementspresent fairly, in al
l material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows foreach of the three yea
rs in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 16, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
These financial
 statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased
 on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonableassurance
 about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess
 the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures
 included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting
 principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The
 critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe
 communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging,
 subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financialstatements,
 taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on theaccounts or disclosures to which 
they relate.173

Impairment of goodwill of the Commercial Business reporting unitDescription of the
Matter
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s goodwill related to the Commercial Business reporting unit was $26.5 billion. As discussed inNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an annual impairment review, or more
frequent reviews, if eve
nts and circumstances indicate an impairment exists.Auditing
 management's annual goodwill impairment test related to the Commercial Business reporting unit was complex and highlyjudgmental
 due  to  the  significant  estimation  required  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit.  In  particular,  the  fair  valueestimate
 was  sensitive  to  changes  in  significant  assumptions,  such  as  the  discount  rate,  projected  revenue  and  projected  operatingincome that are forwa
rd-looking and affected by future economic and market conditions.How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  Company’s  annualgoodwill impairment rev
iew process, including controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above. To
 test the estimated fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others,assessing
 methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in itsanalysis.
 We compared the significant assumptions to the reporting unit’s historical results and third-party industry data. We performedsensitivity
 analyses  of  significant  assumptions  to evaluate  the  changes  in the fair  value  of the reporting  unit that  would result  fromchanges
 in  the  key  assumptions.  We  involved  valuation  specialists  to  assist  in  our  assessment  of  the  methodology  and  significantassumptions
 (such as the discount rate), used by the Company. In addition, we tested management’s reconciliation of the fair value ofall reporting units to th
e market capitalization of the Company.Valuation of health care costs payable
Description of the
Matter 
At December 31, 2020, the incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) liabilities represented $6.1 billion of $7.9 billion of health care costspayable.
 As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s liability for health care costs payable includes estimatedpayments
 for (1) services rendered to members but not yet reported and (2) claims that have been reported but not yet paid, each as ofthe
 financial  statement  date  (collectively,  “IBNR”).  The  estimated  IBNR  liability  is  developed  utilizing  actuarial  principles  andassumptions that
 include historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, historical and assumed medical cost trends,historical utiliz
ation of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevantfactors
 to  record  the  actuarial  best  estimate  of  health  care  costs  payable.  There  is  significant  uncertainty  inherent  in  determiningmanagement’s
 actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. In particular, the estimate is sensitive to the assumed completionfactors and the assumed
 health care cost trend rates. Auditing
 management’s actuarial best estimate of IBNR reserves for health care costs payable for its products and services involved ahigh degree of subjectivi
ty in evaluating management’s assumptions used in the valuation process.How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process for estimatingIBNR
 reserves. This included, among others, controls over the completeness and accuracy of data used in the actuarial projections, thetransfer
 of  data  between  underlying  source  systems,  and  the  review  and  approval  processes  that  management  has  in  place  for  theactuarial princip
les and assumptions used in estimating the health care costs payable.To test
 IBNR reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claim andmembership
 data used in the calculation of IBNR reserves. We involved actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures, whichincluded,
 among  others,  evaluating  the  methodologies  applied  by  the  Company  in  determining  the  actuarially  determined  liability,evaluating
 management’s  actuarial  principles  and  assumptions  used  in  their  analysis  based  on  historical  claim  experience,  andindependently calculating
 a range of reserve estimates for comparison to management’s actuarial best estimate of the liability for healthcare
 costs payable. Additionally, we performed a review of the prior period liabilities for incurred but not paid claims to subsequentclaims development.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
The Company’s Chief Executive Offi

efined in Rules 13a-15 (f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2020, have concluded that asof such date the Company’s disclosu
re controls and procedures were adequate and effective at a reasonable assurance level and designed to ensure that materialinformation relat
ing to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to such officers on a timely basis.Management’s report on internal control ov
er financial reportingManagement is responsi
ble for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s interna l control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the Company; (2) p rovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of theCompany’s consolidated financ
ial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company arebeing made only in accordan
ce with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention ortimely detection of un
authorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financialstatements. In order to 
ensure the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such control and did so mostrecently for its fin
ancial reporting as of December 31, 2020.Management conducted an ass
essment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). This evaluation includedreview of the documentat
ion, evaluation of the design effectiveness and testing of the operating effectiveness of controls. The Company’ s system of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by the Company’s internal auditors, written policies and procedures and a written Code of Conductadopted by CVS Health’s Board of Directors, app
licable to all employees of the Company. In addition, the Company has an internal Disclosure Committee,comprised of managemen
t from each functional area within the Company, which performs a separate review of disclosure controls and procedures. There areinherent limitations in the effecti
veness of any system of internal control over financial reporting.Based on management’s assessm
ent, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonableassurance that assets a
re safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements as of December 31, 2020.Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent reg
istered public accounting firm, is appointed by CVS Health’s Board of Directors and ratified by CVS Health’sstockholders. They were engaged to

Certain Statutory and Charter ProvisionsCertain provisions of the Chart
er and By-Laws summarized in the following paragraphs may be deemed to have an antitakeover effect and may delay, deferor prevent a tender offer 
or takeover attempt.Potential Issuances of Preferred Stock and Prefer
ence StockAs of February 16, 2021, the Charter author
ized 120,619 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share and 50,000,000 shares of preference stock, parvalue $1.00 per share. The Charte
r also authorizes the board to issue shares of preferred stock or preference stock, from time to time, in such class or classes, andsuch series within any class, and wi
th such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations orrestrictions thereo
f as the board may determine, including, for example, (i) the designation of the class or series; (ii) the number of shares of the class or series,which number the board may the
reafter (except where otherwise provided in the designation of any subsequently authorized class or series) increase or decrease(but not below the number of shar
es thereof then outstanding); (iii) whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or noncumulative and the dividend rate of theclass or series; (iv) 
the dates on which dividends, if any, will be payable; (v) the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the class or series;(vi) the terms and amoun
ts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of shares of the class or series; (vii) the amounts payable on shares of theclass or series in the ev
ent of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of CVS Health; (viii) whether the shares of the classor series will be convert
ible into shares of any other class or series, or any other security, of CVS Health or any other corporation, and, if so, the specification ofsuch other class or series o
r such other security, the conversion price or prices or rate or rates, any adjustments thereof, the date or dates as of which such shareswill be convertible and a
ll other terms and conditions upon which such conversion may be made; (ix) restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same class orseries or of any other cl
ass or series; and (x) the voting rights, if any, of the holders of such class or series. The authorized capital stock of CVS Health, includingpreferred stock, pref
erence stock and common stock, will be available for issuance without further action by CVS Health stockholders, unless such action isrequired by applicable 
law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which CVS Health’s securities may be listed or traded. If theapproval of CVS Health stockholders is not so 
required, the board does not intend to seek stockholder approval.Although the board has no intention a
t the present time of doing so, it could issue a class or series of preferred stock or preference stock that could,depending on the terms of such c
lass or series, impede completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt that the holders of some, or a majority, ofCVS Health shares might believe to b
e in their best interests or in which CVS Health stockholders might receive a premium for their shares over the then-currentmarket price of such sha
res.Potential Issuances of Rights to Purchase Securities
CVS Health does not currently have a sto
ckholder rights plan, although the board retains the right to adopt a new plan at a future date. The Charter grantsthe board exclusive author
ity to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase from CVS Health shares of capital stock or other securities and toelect to repurchase, 
redeem, terminate or amend any such rights. The times at which and terms upon which such rights are to be issued, repurchased, redeemed,terminated or amend
ed are to be determined exclusively by the board and set forth in the contracts or instruments that evidence any such rights. The authority ofthe board with respect to such 
rights includes determining, for example, (i) the purchase price of the capital stock or other securities or property to be purchasedupon exercise of such rights; 
(ii) provisions relating to the times at which and the circumstances under which such rights may be exercised or sold or otherwisetransferred, eithe
r together with or separately from any other shares or other securities of CVS Health; (iii) provisions which adjust the number or exercise price ofsuch rights or the amount or na
ture of the shares, other securities or other property receivable upon exercise of such rights in the event of a combination, split orrecapitalizat
ion of any shares of CVS Health, a change in ownership of CVS Health’s shares or other securities or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale ofassets or other occurren
ce relating to CVS Health or any shares of CVS Health, and provisions restricting the ability of CVS Health to enter into any suchtransaction absent an assu
mption by the other party or parties thereto of the obligations of CVS Health under such rights; (iv) provisions which deny the holder of aspecified percentag
e of the outstanding securities of CVS Health the right to exercise such rights and/or cause such rights held by such holder to become void;(v) provisions which
2

permit CVS Health to redeem or exchange such rights; and (vi) the appointment of the rights agent with respect to such rights. This provision is intended toconfirm the board’s exc
lusive authority to issue, repurchase, redeem, terminate or amend share purchase rights or other rights to purchase shares or securities ofCVS Health or any other corporation.
Stockholder Action by Written Consent
The Charter provides that sto
ckholder action may be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by written consent in lieu of a meeting, butonly if such action is taken 
in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and By-Laws. Any person other than CVS Health seeking to have the CVS Healthstockholders authorize or 
take corporate action by written consent without a meeting is required to deliver a written notice signed by holders of record of at leasttwenty-five percent (25
%) of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of CVS Health entitled to express consent on the relevant action and request that arecord date be fixed fo
r such purpose.Stockholder Vote on Fundamental or Extraordinary Corporate Transactions
Under Delaware law, a sale, le
ase or exchange of all or substantially all of CVS Health’s assets, an amendment to the Charter, a merger or consolidation ofCVS Health with another corporation or 
a dissolution of CVS Health generally requires the affirmative vote of the board and, with limited exceptions, theaffirmative vote o
f a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on the transaction.With respect to trans
actions with related persons (persons who own at least 10% of the outstanding capital stock of CVS Health), the Charter provides that amajority of outstanding sha
res (excluding those owned by the related person) voting as a single class is required to approve a business combination transaction witha related person, unless (
i) such transaction is approved by a majority of continuing directors (directors who are not the related person, or an affiliate or associatethereof (or a repres
entative or nominee of the related person or such affiliate or associate), that is involved in the relevant business combination and (a) who weremembers of the board immediatel
y prior to the time that such related person became a related person or (b) whose initial election as a director was recommendedby the affirmative vo
te of a least a majority of the continuing directors then in office, provided that, in either such case, such continuing director has continued inoffice after becoming a contin
uing director) or (ii) certain fair price requirements are met.State Anti-Takeover Provisions
CVS Health has not opted out of Section 203 of the De
laware General Corporation Law, which provides that, if a person acquires 15% or more of theoutstanding voting stock of a Delawa
re corporation, thereby becoming an “interested stockholder,” that person may not engage in certain “business combinations”with the corporation, includ
ing mergers, purchases and sales of 10% or more of its assets, stock purchases and other transactions pursuant to which the percentageof the corporation’s stock owned by 
the interested stockholder increases (other than on a pro rata basis) or pursuant to which the interested stockholder receives afinancial benefit 
from the corporation, for a period of three years after becoming an interested stockholder unless one of the following exceptions applies: (i) theboard approved the acquisit
ion of stock pursuant to which the person became an interested stockholder or the transaction that resulted in the person becoming aninterested stockholder p
rior to the time that the person became an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the personbecoming an interested s
tockholder such person owned at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock of CVS Health, excluding, for purposes of determining thevoting stock outstanding, voting stock owned by d
irectors who are also officers and certain employee stock plans; or (iii) the transaction is approved by the boardand by the affirmativ
e vote of two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. An “interested stockholder” alsoincludes the affili
ates and associates of a 15% or more owner and any affiliate or associate of CVS Health who was the owner of 15% or more of the outstandingvoting stock within the three
-year period prior to determine whether a person is an interested stockholder.3

entitled to:
(i)    Executive’s earned but unpaid Base Salary and other vested but unpaid cash entitlements (including any earned but

(ii)    Executive’s other vested benefits earned by Executive for the period through and including the date of Executive’stermination of employment, which shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans, programs or arrangements (the

Payment Period ”) in equal installments during the Payment Period in accordance with the applicable Company payroll, in an aggregate amount equal to two times the
sum of (y) the highest Base Salary in effect during the six-month period immediately prior to the time of such termination of employment and

Annual Bonus opportunity at target and the actual funding percentage for the Annual Bonus Plan for such performance period, as determined

bonuses are paid to senior executives of the Company;
(iii)    With respect to equity awards made prior to the Effective Date, Executive shall be treated as eligible for ‘retirement’
under the vesting and exercise terms of any such equity award. For the avoidance of doubt, ‘retirement’ treatment for equity awards made

stock units and any LTIP awards, pro-rated vesting as of Executive’s termination of employment date (with any performance criteria deemed
achieved based on actual performance as of the end of the applicable performance period) and settlement on the originally scheduled

provided
, however, that Executive shall not be permitted to exercise any stock option or stock appreciation right beyond the original term of such award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this 
Section 3.02(b)(iii)  shall not apply to the Closing Sign-On Equity Award or equity awards granted following the Effective Date;
4

(iv)    With respect to Company equity awards granted following the Effective Date, Executive shall be treated as ‘retirement’eligible under the vesting and exercise terms of the applicable award agreements relating to Company awards generally applicable to senior-
level executives of the Company; and
(v)    Continued participation in all medical, health and life insurance plans at the same benefit and cost sharing level at which
Executive and Executive’s eligible dependents were participating on the date of termination of Executive’s employment until the earlier of:
(1) the 18- month anniversary of Executive’s termination of employment date; or (2) the date, or dates, Executive receives equivalent
coverage and benefits under the plans and programs of a subsequent employer (such coverage and benefits to be determined on a coverage-
bycoverage, or benefit-by- benefit, basis); 
provided , however, that (A) if Executive is precluded from continuing Executive’s participation in any employee benefit plan or program as provided in this clause (v), Executive shall receive cash payments equal on an aftertax basis to the
cost to Executive of obtaining the benefits provided under the plan or program in which Executive is unable to participate for the period
specified in this clause (v), (B) such cost shall be deemed to be the lowest reasonable cost that would be incurred by Executive in obtaining
such benefit on an individual basis, and (C) payment of such amounts shall be made quarterly in advance. For the avoidance of doubt,
Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive shall be responsible for Executive’s portion of any premiums due in connection with
Executive’s continued participation in any medical, health and life insurance plans pursuant to this 
Section 3.02(b)(v) . To the extent that Executive is a “Specified Employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code at the time of her separation from
service, to the extent required by Section 409A and the regulations issued thereunder, the payments to which Executive would otherwise be
entitled during the first six months following her separation of service shall be deferred and accumulated for a period of six months and paid
in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month with the seventh month’s payment, with interest on such deferred compensation at the
rate paid pursuant to the stable value fund of the Company’s 401(k) plan or, if such fund no longer exists, the fund with the investment
criteria most clearly comparable to that of such fund.
(c)    For the avoidance of doubt and consistent with the applicable award agreements, equity awards made by Aetna before the
Closing Effective Date, the Closing Sign-On Equity Award, 2018-2020 LTIP and any supplemental LTIP with respect to the 2018-2020
performance period shall be treated as follows: (1) upon an involuntary termination of Executive’s employment by reason of death, unvested
awards shall become immediately vested (with any performance criteria deemed achieved based on target performance as of Executive’s
death); and (2) upon an involuntary termination of Executive’s employment by reason of Disability, pro-rated vesting as of Executive’s
termination of employment date (with any performance criteria deemed achieved based on actual performance as of the end of the applicable
performance period); 
provided  that in each case stock options shall remain exercisable for one year following Executive’s termination of employment date, except that Executive shall not be permitted to exercise any stock option beyond the original term of such award.
(d)    If Executive experiences a Qualifying Event within two years following a Change in Control, any outstanding equity awards
held by Executive at such time shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement governing such equity awards.

shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any
officer or director of the Company), against all costs, charges and expenses whatsoever incurred or sustained by Executive or Executive’s
legal representatives at the time such costs, charges and expenses are incurred or sustained, in connection with any action, suit or proceeding

SECTION 5.15. Restrictive Covenant Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Executive shall execute the Company’s Restrictive Covenant Agreement (the “
Restrictive Covenant Agreement ”), attached hereto as Exhibit B , which shall become effective upon the Effective Date and shall supersede Executive’s current Restrictive Covenant Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2018,
which shall remain in full force and effect until such time. Executive acknowledges that the Company may modify such Restrictive Covenant
Agreement in the future in connection with the granting of equity awards and Executive agrees to execute a modified agreement to the extent
the modification is applicable to senior officers of the Company and not in anticipation of a Change in Control. Upon request by the
Company, Executive agrees to execute a new Restrictive Covenant Agreement, with substantially similar post-employment non-competition
and non-solicitation periods and limitations as those set forth in the Restrictive Covenant Agreement then applicable to Executive, upon
Executive’s termination of employment in exchange for a one-time cash payment equal to $10,000, which shall be paid within 30 days of
Executive’s execution of such Restrictive Covenant Agreement.
SECTION 5.16.
 Stock Ownership Requirements. Executive acknowledges and understands that the Company has adopted certain stock ownership guidelines for executives and that the Company expects Executive to own shares of stock in the Company consistent with
Executive’s position in accordance with such stock ownership guidelines, as approved by the Committee and as in effect from time to time.
SECTION 5.17.
 Section 409A. If any provision of this Agreement (or any award of compensation or benefits provided under this Agreement) would cause Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall reform such
provision to comply with Section 409A and agrees to maintain, to the maximum extent practicable without violating Section 409A of the
Code, the original intent and economic benefit to Executive of the applicable provision. The Company shall not accelerate the payment of any
deferred compensation in violation of Section 409A of the Code and to the extent required under Section 409A, the Company shall delay the
payment of any deferred compensation for six months following Executive’s termination of employment. When used in connection with any
payments subject to Section 409A required to be made hereunder, the phrase “termination of employment” and correlative terms shall mean
separation from service as defined in Section 409A. Unless such payments are otherwise exempt from Section 409A, any reimbursements or
in-kind benefits provided under 
Sections 2.03, 2.04, 3.02 or 5.02  of this Agreement shall be administered in accordance with Section 409A, such that: (a) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during one year shall not affect the expenses
eligible for reimbursement or the in-kind benefits provided in any other year; (b) reimbursement of eligible expenses shall be made on or
before December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred; and (c) Executive’s right to reimbursement or in-kind
benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or to exchange for another benefit. For purposes of Section 409A, Executive’s right to receive any
installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.
SECTION 5.18.
 Section 280G. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Separation Benefits described in this Agreement either alone or together with any other payments and benefits which Executive has the right receive from the
Company or any affiliated company (together with the Separation Benefits, the “
Total Benefits ”) would subject Executive to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (the “
Excise Tax ”), then the Company shall reduce the Separation Benefits (the “ Benefit Reduction ”) by the amount necessary to result in 
9

Executive not being subject to the Excise Tax, if such reduction would result in Executive’s “Net After-Tax Amount” attributable to the TotalBenefits being greater than it would be if no Benefit Reduction was effected. For this purpose “Net After-Tax Amount” shall mean the net
amount of the Total Benefits that Executive is entitled to receive under this Agreement or any other agreement, plan or arrangement of the
Company or otherwise after giving effect to all federal, state and local taxes that would be applicable to such payments, including, but not
limited to, the Excise Tax. The determination of whether any such Benefit Reduction shall be effected shall be made by a nationally
recognized public accounting firm selected by the Company that is reasonably acceptable to Executive and is not the audit firm of the
potential acquirer in any transaction that would constitute a Change in Control (the “
Accounting Firm ”) and such determination shall be binding on both Executive and the Company. In the event it is determined that a Benefit Reduction is required, the parties shall cooperate in
all material respects to mitigate the amount of any such reduction. To the extent that any Benefit Reduction is required following mitigation,
then such reduction shall be done first by reducing cash severance; then any accelerated vesting of any equity awards shall be reduced or
eliminated or waived, in reverse order of date of grant; and finally any other benefits to which Executive is or may be entitled shall be
reduced or eliminated, all as determined by the Accounting Firm.
SECTION 5.19. 
No provision of this Agreement may be altered, modified, or amended unless such alteration, modification or amendment is agreed to in writing and signed by each of the parties hereto.

which is contingent on the execution of this Agreement and compliance with its terms.
2.    Non-Competition
.  During my employment by the Corporation and during the Non-Competition Period following the termination of myemployment for any reason, I will not, directly or indirectly, engage in Competition or provide Consulting or Audit Services within the
Restricted Area.
a.    
Competition.  Engaging in “Competition” means providing services to a Competitor of the Corporation (whether as anemployee, independent contractor, consultant, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, investor, or shareholder, except as a shareholder of
less than one percent of a publicly traded company) that: (i) are the same or similar in function or purpose to the services I provided to the
Corporation at any time during the last two years of my employment by the Corporation; or (ii) will likely result in the disclosure of
Confidential Information to a Competitor or the use of Confidential Information on behalf of a Competitor. 
If a representative of the Corporation, during my employment or the Non-Competition Period, requests that I identify the company or business to which I will be or am
providing services, or with which I will be or am employed, and requests that I provide information about the services that I am or will be
providing to such entity, I shall provide the Corporation with a written statement detailing the identity of the entity and the nature of the
services that I am or will be providing to such entity with sufficient detail to allow the Corporation to independently assess whether I am or
will be in violation of this Agreement.
 Such statement shall be delivered to the Corporation’s Chief Human Resources Officer or herauthorized delegate via personal delivery

not be considered a Retail Competitor if such entity derives annual gross revenues from its business in an amount which is less than 2% of the

apply to a determination of whether I am engaging in “Competition” as set forth in Section 2(a)(ii) above.
The parties acknowledge that both the Corporation’s products and services and the entities which compete with the Corporation’s products
and services evolve and an entity will be considered a Competitor if it provides products or services competitive with the products and
services provided by the Corporation within the last two years of my employment.

3.    Non-Solicitation.  During the Non-Solicitation Period, which shall be during my employment by the Corporation and for 24 monthsfollowing the termination of my employment with the Corporation for any reason, I will not, unless a duly authorized officer of the
Corporation gives me written authorization to do so:
a.    interfere with the Corporation’s relationship with its Business Partners by soliciting or communicating (regardless of who
initiates the communication) with a Business Partner to: (i) induce or encourage the Business Partner to stop doing business or reduce its

“Business Partner” means: a customer (person or entity), prospective customer (person or entity), healthcare provider, supplier, agency,

employment or contractor candidate; or (iii) otherwise helping any person or entity hire an employee or contractor away from the
Corporation.
4.    Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information
. a.    Subject to Sections 7 and 
8 below, I will not at any time, whether during or after the termination of my employment, disclose to any person or entity any of the Corporation’s Confidential Information, except as may be appropriately required in the ordinary course of
performing my duties as an employee of the Corporation.
 The Corporation’s Confidential Information includes but is not limited to thefollowing non-public information: trade secrets; computer code generated or developed by the Corporation; software or programs and related
documentation; strategic compilations and analysis; strategic processes; business or financial methods, practices and plans; non-public costs
and prices; operating margins; marketing, merchandising and selling techniques and information; customer lists; provider lists; details of
customer agreements; pricing arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors or suppliers including but not limited to any

parties which is given to the Corporation pursuant to an obligation or agreement to keep such information confidential (collectively, “Confidential Information”).
 I shall not use or attempt to use any Confidential Information on behalf of any person or entity other than theCorporation, or in any manner which may injure or cause loss or may be calculated to injure or cause loss, whether directly or indirectly, to
the Corporation. 
If, at any time over the last two years of my employment at CVS, my position included access to Confidential Information, as described above, specifically related to the Corporation’s procurement of prescription drugs, I understand and agree my employment with a
pharmaceutical manufacturer, distributor or supplier (“Pharmaceutical Entity”)would place a substantial risk of use and/or disclosure of
Confidential Information with which I have been or will be entrusted during my employment with the Corporation. In light of this risk of
disclosure, I acknowledge and agree that the Corporation will be entitled to immediate injunctive
 relief to prevent me from disclosing anysuch Confidential Information in the course of my employment with any such Pharmaceutical Entity.
 I agree that the disclosure of suchConfidential Information, to Corporation’s PBM Competitors with which one may negotiate in the course of employment with such
Pharmaceutical Entity, would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Corporation. For employees residing in Connecticut, these
restrictions on use or disclosure of Confidential Information will only apply for three (3) years after the end of my employment where
information that does not qualify as a trade secret is concerned; however, the restrictions will continue apply to trade secret information for as
long as the information at issue remains qualified as a trade secret.
b.    During my employment, I shall not make, use, or permit to be used, any materials of any nature relating to any matter within the
scope of the business of the Corporation or concerning any of its dealings or affairs other than for the benefit of the Corporation.
 I shall not,after the termination of my employment, use or permit to be used any such materials and shall return same in accordance with Section 5
below.
5.    Ownership and Return of the Corporation’s Property
. On or before my final date of employment with the Corporation, I shall returnto the Corporation all property of the Corporation in my possession, custody or control, including but not limited to the originals and copies
of any information provided to or acquired by me in connection with the performance of my duties for the Corporation, such as files,
correspondence, communications, memoranda, e-mails, slides, records, and all other documents, no matter how produced or reproduced, all
computer equipment, communication devices (including but not limited to any mobile phone or other portable digital assistant or device),
computer programs and/or files, and all office keys and access cards. I agree that all the items described in this Section are the sole property
of the Corporation.
6.    Rights to Inventions, Works
. a.    
Assignment of Inventions. All inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, improvements, designs, discoveries, ideas, trademarks or trade secrets, whether patentable or otherwise protectable under similar law, made, conceived or developed

as such are the sole property of the Corporation. The decision whether to commercialize or market any Invention developed by me solely orjointly with others is within the Corporation’s sole discretion and for the Corporation’s sole benefit and no royalty will be due to me as a
result of the Corporation’s efforts to commercialize or market any such Invention.
b.    
Inventions Retained and Licensed. I have attached hereto as Exhibit A, a list describing all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, improvements, and trade secrets which were made by me prior to my employment with the Corporation (“Prior
Inventions”), which belong to me and are not assigned to the Corporation hereunder.
 If no such list is attached, I represent that there are nosuch Prior Inventions.
 I will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, any Prior Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest intoa Corporation product, process or machine without the Corporation’s prior written consent.

or in which I have an interest, the Corporation is hereby granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual,
worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Prior Invention as part of or in connection with such product, process or
machine.
c.    
Patent and Copyright Registrations.  I will assist the Corporation, or its designee, at the Corporation’s expense, in every properway to secure the Corporation’s rights in the Inventions and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights
relating thereto, including, but not limited to, the disclosure to the Corporation of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the

relating thereto.
 My obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shallcontinue after my employment ends for any reason and/or after the termination of this Agreement.
 If the Corporation is unable because of mymental or physical incapacity or for any other reason to secure my signature to apply for or to pursue any application for any United States or
foreign patents or copyright registrations covering Inventions or original works of authorship assigned to the Corporation as above, then I
hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Corporation and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, to act
for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution
and issuance of letters patent or copyright registrations thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.
7.    Cooperation
. a.    In the event I receive a subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order to testify or produce Confidential
Information or any other information or property of the Corporation, I shall promptly: (a) notify the Corporation of the item, document, or
information sought by such subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order; (b) furnish the Corporation with a copy

behalf of the Corporation. The Corporation agrees to reimburse me for any reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated with my

those other agreements apply to me, set forth the entire agreement between the parties hereto and fully supersede any and all prior and/orsupplemental understandings, whether written or oral, between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement; 
provided , however
, that my Current Restrictive Covenant Agreement shall continue to remain in full force and effect until the Effective Date. I agree and acknowledge that I have not relied on any representations, promises or agreements of any kind in connection with my decision to accept
the terms of this Agreement, except for the representations, promises and agreements herein. This Agreement shall not have any effect on any
prior existing agreements between Corporation and me regarding the arbitration of workplace legal disputes and any such agreements remain
in full force and effect. Any modification to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by me and the Corporation’s Chief Human

be unenforceable at law, the parties consent to such provision or provisions being modified or limited by the appropriate judicial body (where
allowed by applicable law), so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with the applicable law.

forth pre-requisites I must meet in order to receive severance, including but not limited to execution and non-revocation of the form of release
agreement attached as Exhibit A to my Employment Agreement. In the event that the Corporation fails to comply with its obligations to offer
me severance according to my Employment Agreement, then Section 2 of this Agreement shall be of no further effect. I agree that if I decline
the Corporation’s offer of severance, I shall continue to be subject to the restrictions in Section 2.

Island. The headings of the sections contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be deemed to control or affect the
meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.
