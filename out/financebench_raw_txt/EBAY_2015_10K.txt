ITEM 1: 
BUSINESS eBay Inc. was formed as a sole prop
rietorship in September 1995 and was incorporated in California in May 1996. In April 1998, we reincorporated inDelaware, and in September 1998, we co
mpleted the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices are located at 2065 HamiltonAvenue, San Jose, California 95125, and our te
lephone number is (408) 376-7400. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, when werefer to “we,” “our,” “us
” or “eBay” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its California predecessor, aswell as all of its consolid
ated subsidiaries. When we refer to “eBay Inc.” we mean our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. When we refer to“PayPal,” we mean the businesses unde
rlying our former Payments segment. When we refer to “Enterprise,” we mean the businesses underlying our formerEnterprise segment. Afte
r a strategic review by its Board of Directors, eBay Inc. spun off PayPal and sold its Enterprise businesses in 2015. See “Notable BusinessTransactions in 2015” below.
eBay Inc. is a global comme
rce leader including our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, we connect millions of buyers andsellers around the world. The t
echnologies and services that power our platforms are designed to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory forsale and buyers to find and buy it v
irtually anytime and anywhere. Our Marketplace platforms include our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, itslocalized counterpa
rts and the eBay mobile apps; which are among the world’s largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and uniqueselection. Our StubHub platforms in
clude our online ticket platform located at www.stubhub.com and the StubHub mobile apps. These platforms provide fans witha safe, convenient plac
e to purchase tickets to the games, concerts and theater shows they want to attend and an easy way to sell tickets. Our Classifieds platformsinclude a collection o
f brands such as Mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Classifieds and others. Offering online classifieds in more than 1,500 citiesaround the world, these platfo
rms help people find whatever they are looking for in their local communities.eBay Inc. has made investmen
ts and acquisitions to help enable commerce on our platforms for buyers and sellers online (e.g., desktop and laptopcomputers) or on mobile dev
ices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). Our objective is to bring the world’s inventory to the world’s buyers. Driven by the ubiquity ofthe Internet and the pro
liferation of mobile devices, we believe that the way consumers engage with each other, brands and services is fundamentally changing,blurring the lines between o
ffline retail and online commerce. We believe that this trend has expanded our addressable market in the ecommerce industry and wemeasure our footprint in 
this addressable market according to Gross Merchandise Volume ("GMV"). GMV consists of the total value of all successfully closedtransactions between users on ou
r Marketplace and StubHub platforms during the applicable period, regardless of whether the buyer and seller actuallyconsummated the transaction.
Our company is only successful when the buy
ers and sellers we enable are successful. We are primarily a transaction-based business that generates revenuefrom the transactions 
that we successfully enable. We also generate revenue through marketing services, including classifieds and advertising. In addition, we havecreated an open source pl
atform that provides software developers and merchants access to our application programming interfaces, or APIs, to develop softwareand solutions for commerc
e. As of December 31, 2015 , our Marketplace and StubHub plat forms had more than 162 million active buyers and more than 800million listings global
ly. The term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyers who successfully closed a transaction on our Marketplace and StubHubplatforms within the prev
ious 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one account.4

For additional financial information as well as the geographic areas where we conduct business, please see "Note 6 - Segments" to the consolidated financialstatements included in 
this report. Additionally, please see the information in "Item 1A: Risk Factors" under the caption "Our international operations are subject toincreased risks, which may ha
rm our business," which describes risks associated with eBay Inc.'s foreign operations.Notable Business Transactions in 2015
On September 30, 2014, we announced that our Board o
f Directors (“Board”), following a strategic review of the company’s growth strategies andstructure, approved a plan 
to separate PayPal into an independent publicly traded company. On July 17, 2015, we completed the distribution of 100% of theoutstanding common stock of PayPal to ou
r stockholders, pursuant to which PayPal became an independent company. See "Note 4 - Discontinued Operations" ofour consolidated financi
al statements for additional information.Additionally, during the second qua
rter of 2015, our Board approved a plan to sell Enterprise. On July 16, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sellEnterprise, and on November 2, 2015, the s
ale closed. See "Note 4 - Discontinued Operations" of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.eBay Inc.'s platforms offer the fol
lowing features:We are a leading commerce plat
form for buyers and sellers.Our business model and pricing ar
e designed so that our business is successful when our sellers are successful. The majority of our revenue comes from atake rate on the GMV of transa
ctions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. In 2015 , we generated $82 billion in GMV. Our eBay Top Rated Seller program, or 
eTRS, rewards qualifying sellers with fee discounts and improved search standing for qualifying listings if they areable to maintain excellent cust
omer service ratings and meet specified criteria for shipping and returns. We believe that sellers who fulfill these standards helppromote our goal of mai
ntaining an online marketplace that is safe and hassle-free.eBay Money Back Guarantee covers i
tems purchased on our websites in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Australia and Canada through a qualifying paymentmethod and protects most buye
rs with respect to items that are not received or are received but not as described in the listing. Some purchases, including somevehicles, are not cover
ed. eBay Money Back Guarantee provides coverage for the purchase price of the item, plus original shipping costs, for a limited period oftime from the original date of
 transaction, and includes a streamlined interface to help buyers and sellers navigate the process.The size and scale of our pl
atforms are designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investment, for example insales and marketing, mobi
le, customer acquisition and customer service.We provide a variety of acc
ess points for buyers to shop virtually anytime, anywhere.Our platforms are acc
essible through a traditional online experience (e.g., desktop and laptop computers) or from mobile devices (e.g., smartphones andtablets). Our multi-sc
reen approach offers downloadable, easy-to-use mobile applications for the iPhone, the iPad, Android and Windows mobile devices that allowaccess to ebay.com and some o
f our other websites and vertical shopping experiences.We provide a large and unique selection of inventor
y globally.We had over 800 million it
ems listed for sale on our platforms as of December 31, 2015 , which we believe makes us one of th e world’s largest onlinemarketplaces. For 2015, approxi
mately 59% of our GMV was generated outside the U.S.We strive to provide value to buy
ers and sellers.We believe that we have so
me of the lowest prices available for a number of consumer products. In the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, the majority ofsuccessfully closed trans
actions included free shipping during 2015. We have developed a number of features on our Marketplace platforms in the areas of trustand safety (including our Sel
ler Performance Standards, eTRS, eBay Money Back Guarantee, Verified Rights Owner Program and Feedback Forum), customersupport and value-added tools and s
ervices, as well as loyalty programs (for both buyers and sellers). These features are designed to make users more5

comfortable buying and selling with unknown partners and completing transactions online or through mobile devices, as well as rewarding our top buyers andsellers for their loyalty.
For sellers in particul
ar, we recently introduced a number of upcoming changes to our seller policies to help small- and medium-sized sellers be moresuccessful on our platforms 
and better reward sellers who provide exceptional service to eBay buyers. These changes include providing more objective standards;giving sellers the abil
ity to customize how they manage returns based on their specific business needs; and launching the Seller Hub, which puts a seller’s listingand marketing tools in one c
entral place. We offer buyers and sellers choice.
We offer choice to buye
rs and sellers across a number of dimensions:•
By listing format: Sellers can choose to list their products and services through fixed price listings or an auction-style format on our platforms.◦
Our fixed price format on ebay.com allows buyers and sellers to close transactions at a pre-determined price set by the seller. Sellers are alsoable to signal that they would b
e willing to close the transaction at a lower price through the Best Offer feature.◦
Our auction-style format allows a seller to select a minimum price for opening bids.◦
Our Classifieds platforms have listings in over 1,500 cities around the world and are designed to help people list their products and servicesgenerally for free 
and then trade at a local level. These platforms include Mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats and eBay Classifieds,among others.
•
By item condition: Sellers can list, and buyers can search for and purchase, items that are new, refurbished and used, common and rare items, andbranded and unbranded products on our Ma
rketplace platforms.•
By delivery format: Buyers can have items shipped to them through shipping options offered by the seller and selected by the buyer on ourMarketplace platfo
rms. For certain items purchased from certain retailers, buyers can pick up items they purchased online or through mobile devices inone of the retailer
’s physical stores (which we refer to as in-store pickup). This brings more choice for buyers and sellers around delivery cost andconvenience.
We offer a variety of spec
ialized vertical and promotional experiences.We continue to focus on custom
izing our buying and selling experiences to make it easier for users to list, find and buy items by offering formats dedicatedto specific products or c
ategories. On our Marketplace platforms, we have built specialized experiences, such as Daily Deals, Fashion, Motors (vehicles; parts andaccessories) and Elec
tronics. Daily Deals offers a variety of products in multiple categories at discounted prices with free shipping. StubHub is a leader insecondary ticketing for 
event tickets, enabling fans to buy and sell tickets to a large selection of sports, concert, theater and other live entertainment events.Competition
We encounter vigorous compe
tition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can find, buy, sell and pay for similar items through a variety ofcompeting online, mobile 
and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers,catalog and mail-order companie
s, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants (consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and business-to-business), shopping channels and networks. As our produ
ct offerings continue to broaden into new categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect toface additional comp
etition from other online, mobile and offline channels for those new offerings. We compete on the basis of price, product selection andservices.
For more information reg
arding these risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions “Substantial and increasingly intensecompetition worldwide in eco
mmerce may harm our business” and “We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws.”To compete effectiv
ely, we will need to continue to expend significant resources in technology and marketing. These efforts require substantialexpenditures, which could reduc
e our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows and reducethe market price of ou
r common stock. Despite our efforts to preserve and expand the size, diversity and transaction activity of our buyers and sellers and toenhance the user experi
ence, we may not be able to effectively manage our operating expenses, to increase or maintain our revenue or to avoid a decline in ourconsolidated net income o
r a net loss.6

Government RegulationGovernment regulation imp
acts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerce industry in manycountries where we operate. For 
more information regarding these risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption "Our business is subjectto extensive government r
egulation and oversight."Seasonality
We expect transaction activity 
patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in “Item 7:Management's Discussion and Analysis of Fin
ancial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Seasonality.”Technology
eBay Inc.'s platforms util
ize a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others. We havedeveloped intuitive user 
interfaces, buyer and seller tools and transaction processing, database and network applications that help enable our users to reliably andsecurely complete t
ransactions on our sites. Our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, eases the deployment andoperation of large-scale glo
bal products and services and automates much of the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our infrastructure has beendesigned around industry-standa
rd architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. We strive to continually improve ourtechnology to enhance the buye
r and seller experience and to increase efficiency, scalability and security. For information regarding technology-related risks, seethe information in “I
tem 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, productsor services could harm our bus
iness."Intellectual Property
We regard the protec
tion of our intellectual property, including our trademarks (particularly those covering the eBay name), patents, copyrights, domainnames, trade dress and tr
ade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common lawrights in the U.S. and internation
ally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights inproducts and services. We rou
tinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosureagreements with parti
es with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.We pursue the registra
tion of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed U.S. andinternational paten
t applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and tradesecret protection is typically
 expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in anincreasing number of jur
isdictions, a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.We have registered our 
core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an activeprogram to continue to secu
re trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. If we are unable to register or protect ourtrademarks or domain na
mes, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain names are not registered or protected. We havelicensed in the past, and exp
ect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others.From time to time, third 
parties have claimed - and others will likely claim in the future - that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We aretypically involved in a numb
er of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and in “Item 1A: Risk Factors”under the captions "We ar
e subject to patent litigation," "The listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rightsowners, including pirated or coun
terfeit items, may harm its business," and "We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, orthird parties may allege that 
we are infringing their intellectual property rights.”7

Item 1A: RISK FACTORS You should carefully review the 
following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as ourconsolidated financial statement
s and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report, for important information regarding risks that affect us.Risk Factors That May Affect our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Our operating and financial results are subj
ect to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and cash flows, as well as the trading pri
ce of our common stock and debt securities.Our operating and financia
l results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of avariety of factors, in
cluding as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues orearnings (loss) accura
tely. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, andyou should not rely upon them as an indi
cation of future performance. We do not have backlog, and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come fromtransactions involving sal
es during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of netrevenues. Quarterly an
d annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our consolidated financial statements may be significantly different fromhistorical or projec
ted rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The tradingprice of our common stock and d
ebt securities could decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described in this paragraph.Substantial and increasingly int
ense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business.The businesses and markets in which we op
erate are intensely competitive. We currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of online and offlinecompanies providing goods and servi
ces to consumers and merchants. The Internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitivechannels for the sale of 
all types of goods and services. We compete in two-sided markets, and must attract both buyers and sellers to use our platforms. Consumerswho purchase or sell goods and servic
es through us have more and more alternatives, and merchants have more channels to reach consumers. We expectcompetition to continue 
to intensify. Online and offline businesses increasingly are competing with each other and our competitors include a number of online andoffline retaile
rs with significant resources, large user communities and well-established brands. Moreover, the barriers to entry into these channels can be low, andbusinesses easily can launch on
line sites or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of anumber of successful ecom
merce companies. As we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service ormarketing decisions or a
cquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among sellers, which could reduce activity on our platform and harmour profitability.
We face increased competitive pres
sure online and offline. In particular, the competitive norm for, and the expected level of service from, ecommerce andmobile commerce has s
ignificantly increased, due to, among other factors, improved user experience, greater ease of buying goods, lower (or no) shipping costs,faster shipping times and 
more favorable return policies. Also, certain platform businesses, such as Alibaba, Apple, Google and Facebook, many of whom arelarger than us or have gre
ater capitalization, have a dominant and secure position in other industries or certain significant markets, and offer other goods andservices to consumers and m
erchants that we do not offer. If we are unable to change our products, offerings and services in ways that reflect the changingdemands of ecommerce and m
obile commerce marketplaces, particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed-price items and higher expected service levels (someof which depend on services provided by s
ellers on our platforms), or compete effectively with and adapt to changes in larger platform businesses, our businesswill suffer.
Competitors with other revenu
e sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricingpolicies and devote more 
resources to website, mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can. Other competitors may offer or continueto offer faster and/o
r free shipping, delivery on Sunday, same-day delivery, favorable return policies or other transaction-related services which improve the userexperience on their si
tes and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match. Competitors may be able to innovate faster and more efficiently, andnew technologies may
 increase the competitive pressures by enabling competitors to offer more efficient or lower-cost services.Some of our competitors cont
rol other products and services that are important to our success, including credit card interchange, Internet search, and mobileoperating systems. Such compet
itors could manipulate pricing, availability, terms or9

operation of service related to their products and services in a manner that impacts our competitive offerings. For example, Google, which operates a shoppingplatform service, has from time
 to time made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to us from searches on Google. Ifwe are unable to use or adapt 
to operational changes in such services, we may face higher costs for such services, face integration or technological barriers or losecustomers, which could cause our bus
iness to suffer.Consumers who might use our sites to buy goods have 
a wide variety of alternatives, including traditional department, warehouse, boutique, discount andgeneral merchandise stores (a
s well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), online retailers and their related mobile offerings, online andoffline classified s
ervices and other shopping channels, such as offline and online home shopping networks. In the United States, these include Amazon.com(which recently opened an exp
erimental brick-and-mortar store in New York City and continues to expand into new geographies and lines of business), Google,Wal-Mart, Target, Sea
rs, Macy’s, JC Penney, Costco, Office Depot, Staples, OfficeMax, Sam’s Club, Rakuten, Yahoo! Shopping, MSN, QVC and HomeShopping Network, among others. In addition, consu
mers have a large number of online and offline channels focused on one or more of the categories of productsoffered on our site.
Consumers also can turn to many co
mpanies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of allsizes, including social m
edia, online aggregation and classifieds platforms, such as craigslist, Oodle.com and a number of international websites operated bySchibsted ASA or Naspers Limited. Consumers also 
can turn to shopping-comparison sites, such as Google Shopping. In certain markets, our fixed-price listingand traditional auct
ion-style listing formats increasingly are being challenged by other formats, such as classifieds.Our Classifieds platforms of
fer classifieds listings in the United States and a variety of international markets. In many markets in which they operate, ourClassifieds platforms com
pete for customers and for advertisers against more established online and offline classifieds platforms or other competing websites.Our online shopping comparison websites 
(Shopping.com) compete with sites such as Google Shopping, Rakuten, Nextag.com, Pricegrabber.com, Shopzilla,Buscapé in Latin America (owned by Nasp
ers) and Yahoo! Product Search, which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the Internet forspecified products. In addi
tion, sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search-relatedadvertisements on horizon
tal search engine sites, such as Google, Yahoo!, Naver and Baidu. We use product search engines and paid search advertising to helpusers find our sites, but these s
ervices also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations. Consumers may choose to search for productsand services with a horizont
al search engine or shopping comparison website, and such sites may also send users to other shopping destinations.Consumers and merchants who might use ou
r sites to sell goods also have many alternatives, including general ecommerce sites, such as Amazon andAlibaba, and more special
ized sites, such as Etsy. Our international sites also compete for sellers with general and specialized ecommerce sites. Sellers may alsochoose to sell their goods through o
ther channels, such as classifieds platforms. Consumers and merchants also can create and sell through their own sites, and maychoose to purchase online adve
rtising instead of using our services. In some countries, there are online sites that have larger customer bases and greater brandrecognition, as well a
s competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce. We increasingly may compete with local competitors indeveloping countries that h
ave unique advantages, such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authorities.In addition, certain m
anufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels, such as our sites. Manufacturers may attempt touse contractual obligation
s or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goods or services. Manufacturersmay also attempt to enforce mi
nimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to prevent distributors from selling on our platforms oron the Internet genera
lly, or at prices that would make us less attractive relative to other alternatives. The adoption by manufacturers of policies, or their use oflaws or regulations, in each 
case discouraging or restricting the sales of goods or services over the Internet, could force our users to stop selling certain products onour platforms, which could resu
lt in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value of our brands.The principal competi
tive factors for us include the following:    
•
ability to attract, retain and engage buyers and sellers;•
volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;•
trust in the seller and the transaction;•
customer service;10

•brand recognition;    •
community cohesion, interaction and size;•
website, mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;•
system reliability and security;•
reliability of delivery and payment, including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returns;•
level of service fees; and•
quality of search tools.We may be unable to compe
te successfully against current and future competitors. Some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories,larger customer bases 
and greater brand recognition in other business and Internet sectors than we do.Global and regional economic conditions cou
ld harm our business.Our operations and performan
ce depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events (includingvolatility or distress 
in the equity and/or debt or credit markets) have in the past negatively impacted regional and global financial markets and will likely continueto do so from time to tim
e in the future. Uncertainties relating to the ability of Greece to remain in the European Monetary Union may adversely impact theeconomy of the European Union, which is an 
important market in which we do business. These events and conditions could have a negative and adverse impact oncompanies and customers with whi
ch we do business or cause us to write down our assets or investments. In addition, financial turmoil affecting the bankingsystem or financial m
arkets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, new orincremental tight
ening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. Adverse impacts to thecompanies and customers with whi
ch we do business, the banking system, or financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, including areduction in the volume and p
rices of transactions on our commerce platforms.We are exposed to fluctuat
ions in foreign currency exchange rates.Because we generate the m
ajority of our revenues outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial results are impactedby fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates, or foreign exchange rates. The results of operations of many of our internationally focused platforms areexposed to foreign exchange r
ate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars forfinancial reporting pu
rposes. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses willresult in increased U.S. dolla
r denominated revenues and expenses. Similarly, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Britishpound, Korean won or Australian dollar, our 
translation of foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated netrevenues and expenses. In addit
ion to this translation effect, a strengthening U.S. dollar will typically adversely affect the volume of goods being sold by U.S.sellers to Europe and Austral
ia more than it positively affects the volume of goods being sold by sellers in those geographies to buyers in the United States, therebyfurther negatively impacting 
our financial results.While from time to 
time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate theeffects of this exposure. Flu
ctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results, which may have a significant impact on the tradingprice of our common stock and d
ebt securities.Our international operations are subjec
t to increased risks, which could harm our business.Our international businesses, 
especially in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Korea, and cross-border business from greater China, havegenerated a majori
ty of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expandinto international m
arkets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•
expenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the localcurrency and adapting our produ
cts and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•
trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•
difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, andcultural differences;
•
stringent local labor laws and regulations;11

•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•
profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•
political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•
geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•
import or export regulations;•
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, as well asU.S. and foreign laws designed to combat 
money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•
antitrust and competition regulations;•
potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•
economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•
different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•
risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•
national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•
local licensing and reporting obligations; and•
increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable. 
Violations of the complex fo
reign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctionsagainst us, our officers, or ou
r employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies andprocedures designed to promot
e compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.These risks inherent in our in
ternational operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and could harm our business.Any factors that reduce cross-border 
trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.Cross-border trade is an impo
rtant source of both revenue and profits for us. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (or in some cases, only) presencein certain importan
t markets, such as Brazil/Latin America, China, and various other countries. In addition, our cross-border trade is also subject to, and may beimpacted by, foreign exch
ange rate fluctuations.The interpretation and ap
plication of specific national or regional laws, such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products, selectivedistribution networks, and sell
ers in other countries listing items on the Internet, and the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions(e.g., the jurisdiction of 
the buyer, the seller, and/or the location of the item being sold) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Theinterpretation and/o
r application of such laws could impose restrictions on, or increase the costs of, purchasing, selling, shipping, or returning goods across nationalborders.
  
The shipping of goods across national bo
rders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping. Customs and duty procedures and reviews,including duty-free thr
esholds in various key markets, the interaction of national postal systems, and security related governmental processes at internationalborders, may increase cos
ts, discourage cross-border purchases, delay transit and create shipping uncertainties. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-bordertrade or restrict, d
elay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business.Our business may be adversely affect
ed by geopolitical events, natural disasters, seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users to spend less time onour websites or mobile platforms and applications, 
including increased usage of other websites.Our users may spend less time on our webs
ites and our applications for mobile devices as a result of a variety of diversions, including: geopolitical events,such as war, the threat of war, o
r terrorist activity; natural disasters; power shortages or outages, major public health issues, including pandemics; socialnetworking or other
 entertainment websites or mobile applications; significant local, national or global events capturing the attention of a large part of thepopulation; and seasonal flu
ctuations due to a variety of factors. If any of these, or any other factors, divert our users from using of our websites or mobileapplications, our business could b
e materially adversely affected.12

Our success depends to a large degree on our ability to successfully address the rapidly evolving market for transactions on mobile devices.Mobile devices are inc
reasingly used for ecommerce transactions. A significant and growing portion of our users access our platforms through mobiledevices. We may lose users 
if we are not able to continue to meet our users’ mobile and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety of technical and otherconfigurations across dif
ferent mobile devices and platforms increases the challenges associated with this environment. In addition, a number of other companieswith significant resourc
es and a number of innovative startups have introduced products and services focusing on mobile markets.Our ability to successfully 
address the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving market for mobile transactions is crucial to our continued success, and anyfailure to continuously in
crease the volume of mobile transactions effected through our platforms could harm our business.If we cannot keep pace with rapid t
echnological developments to provide new and innovative programs, products and services, the use of our products andour revenues could decline.
Rapid, significant technolog
ical changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes onour business. In addition to our own init
iatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of andaccess to new technologies. W
e expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge. These newservices and technologies 
may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Incorporating new technologiesinto our products and services 
may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability toadopt new services and develop new t
echnologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from clients ormerchants, or third par
ties’ intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes andevolving industry standards.
Our business is subject to extensi
ve government regulation and oversight.We are subject to laws and 
regulations affecting our domestic and international operations in a number of areas, including consumer protection, data privacyrequirements, intel
lectual property ownership and infringement, prohibited items and stolen goods, resale of event tickets, tax, anti-competition, exportrequirements, anti-corruption
, labor, advertising, digital content, real estate, billing, ecommerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobilecommunications and medi
a, environmental, and health and safety regulations, as well as laws and regulations intended to combat money laundering and thefinancing of terrorist activities.
Compliance with these laws, regu
lations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction tojurisdiction may furth
er increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws andregulations or in their 
interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive to our customers, delay the introductionof new products or services in one o
r more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. We have implemented policies and procedures designedto ensure compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws andregulations or our polici
es and procedures.  Regulation in the areas of privac
y and protection of user data could harm our business.We are subject to laws r
elating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users around the world.Much of the personal inform
ation that we collect, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple laws. User data protection laws may be interpreted andapplied inconsistently f
rom country to country. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between oramong ourselves, our subsidiari
es, and other parties with which we have commercial relations. These laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and thatmay harm our business.
Regulatory scrutiny of priva
cy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. We are subject to a number of privacy andsimilar laws and regula
tions in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over time, both through regulatoryand legislative act
ion and judicial decisions. Some of these laws impose requirements that are inconsistent with one another, yet regulators may claim that bothapply. Complying with these varying na
tional requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices13

in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant penalties. In addition, compliance with these laws may restrictour ability to provide serv
ices to our customers that they may find to be valuable. A determination that there have been violations of laws relating to our practicesunder communications-bas
ed laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materiallyharm our business. In particu
lar, because of the enormous number of texts, emails and other communications we send to our users, communications laws thatprovide a specified mone
tary damage award or fine for each violation (such as those described below) could result in particularly large awards or fines.For example, the Federal Commun
ications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, in 2012and 2013 in a manner that could 
increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers, including but not limited to textmessages to mobile phones. Under th
e TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courtsmay treble the damag
e award for willful or knowing violations. We are regularly subject to class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containingallegations that our busin
esses violated the TCPA. These lawsuits, and other private lawsuits not currently alleged as class actions, seek damages (includingstatutory damages) and in
junctive relief, among other remedies. Given the enormous number of communications we send to our users, a determination that therehave been violations of the TCPA or othe
r communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in theaggregate, materi
ally harm our business.We post on our websites our privacy po
licies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by usto comply with our posted privacy po
licies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regula
tions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action privacy litigation), subject us tosignificant penalti
es and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Data collection,privacy and security have b
ecome the subject of increasing public concern. If Internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites, mobile platforms,products, and services as a r
esult of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches,which themselves may resul
t in a violation of these laws.Other laws and regulations could harm our business.
It is not always clear how laws and 
regulations governing matters relevant to our business, such as property ownership, copyrights, trademarks, and otherintellectual prope
rty issues, parallel imports and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, and obscenity apply to our businesses. Many of these lawswere adopted prior to the adv
ent of the Internet, mobile, and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internetand related technologi
es. Many of these laws, including some of those that do reference the Internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basisand the resulting uncert
ainty in the scope and application of these laws and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmentalactions alleging viola
tions of those laws and regulations.As our activities, the produc
ts and services we offer, and our geographical scope continue to expand, regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that weor our users are subject to 
additional requirements (including licensure) or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction, either generally or withrespect to certain actions. 
Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on large companies, and regulatory agencies may viewmatters or interpr
et laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our businesses. Our success and increased visibility havedriven some existing businesses 
that perceive us to be a threat to their businesses to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators.These businesses and their tr
ade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where wehave significant opera
tions. They may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectivenessof our businesses and the abili
ty of users to use our products and services. These established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing, parallel imports,professional seller obl
igations, selective distribution networks, stolen goods, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and the liability of theprovider of an Internet 
marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues. Any changes to the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner thatwould increase our liabil
ity for third-party listings could negatively impact our business.Numerous U.S. states and foreign jurisd
ictions, including the State of California, have regulations regarding “auctions” and the handling of property by“secondhand dealers” or “p
awnbrokers.” Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations upon us or our users, and othersmay attempt to do so in the 
future. Attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing and we could be required to change theway we or
14

our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues, such as forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in somelocations. We could also be sub
ject to fines or other penalties, and any of these outcomes could harm our business.A number of the lawsuits against us 
relating to trademark issues seek to have our platforms subject to unfavorable local laws. For example, “trademarkexhaustion” principles prov
ide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market by thetrademark holder or with 
the holder’s consent. The application of “trademark exhaustion” principles is largely unsettled in the context of the Internet, and iftrademark owners are ab
le to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations, our business could be harmed.As we expand and localize our int
ernational activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in whichwe operate. In addition, bec
ause our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to users worldwide, one or morejurisdictions may cla
im that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users, or the locationof the product or service b
eing sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. For example, we were found liable in France, under French law, for transactions onsome of our websites worldwide that d
id not involve French buyers or sellers. Laws regulating Internet, mobile and ecommerce technologies outside of the UnitedStates are generally 
less favorable to us than those in the United States. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices orrestrict our servic
e offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on us or our users may harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to multipleoverlapping legal or regu
latory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us (e.g., in cross-border trade). Our alleged failure to comply with foreign lawscould subject us to penalti
es ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services, in addition to the significant costs we may incur indefending against such act
ions.We are regularly subject to g
eneral litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries.We are regularly subj
ect to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government investigations, and other proceedings involvingcompetition and antitrust,
 intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes,content generated by our use
rs, services and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grownlarger, our businesses have exp
anded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity.The outcome and impact of su
ch claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome,such investigations and proce
edings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determiningreserves for our pending li
tigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to judgment calls. It is possible that a resolution of one or more suchproceedings could require us 
to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm ourbusiness. These proceedings could a
lso result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, orservices, or requiring a 
change in our business practices in costly ways, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies.Any of these consequences could har
m our business.We are subject to regulatory a
ctivity and antitrust litigation under competition laws.We are subject to scru
tiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including competition laws. Some jurisdictions alsoprovide private rights of 
action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in thepast and may in the future 
allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the United States, individual states, the European Commission or othercountries, or otherwise const
itute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutinyin large markets such as Chin
a. Our business partnerships or agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action orantitrust litigat
ion. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversialbusiness practices could be d
eemed anticompetitive. Certain competition authorities have conducted market studies of our industries. Such claims andinvestigations, even if withou
t foundation, may be very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effortand could result in signifi
cant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices.15

We are subject to patent litigation.We have repeatedly be
en sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. We are a defendant in a number of patent suits and have been notified of severalother potential paten
t disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•
our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•
we continue to expand into new businesses, including through acquisitions; and•
the universe of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and theaggregate number of pat
ents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought dir
ectly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do soor we choose to do so as a business matt
er. We believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been, andcontinue to be, initiat
ed by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes betweenoperating companies in som
e technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and couldrequire us to make expensiv
e changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfyadverse judgments or sett
le claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business.We are exposed to fluctuat
ions in interest rates.Some of our borrowings bear inter
est at floating rates and we have entered into agreements intended to convert the interest rate on some of our fixed rate debtinstruments to floating 
rates. To the extent that prevailing rates increase, our interest expense under these debt instruments will increase.Investments in both fi
xed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rateinvestment securities may be
 adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest-rate risk than those 
with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest-rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-ratesecurities may produce les
s income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part tothese factors, our invest
ment income may decline or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes ininterest rates. In addition
, relatively low interest rates limit our investment income. Fluctuations in interest rates that increase the cost of our current or futureindebtedness, cause the ma
rket value of our assets to decline or reduce our investment income could adversely affect our financial results.Our tickets business is subject 
to regulatory, competitive and other risks that could harm this business.Our tickets business, which includes StubHub, is sub
ject to numerous risks, including:•
Some jurisdictions, in particular jurisdictions outside the United States, prohibit the resale of event tickets (anti-scalping laws) at prices above the facevalue of the tickets or 
at all, or highly regulate the resale of tickets, and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations imposingthese or other restri
ctions could limit or inhibit our ability to operate, or our users’ ability to continue to use, our tickets business.•
Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations.•
In many jurisdictions, our tickets business depends on commercial partnerships with event organizers or licensed ticket vendors, which we must developand maintain on accept
able terms for our tickets business to be successful.•
Our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and liveentertainment industries.
•
A portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on the StubHub platform is processed by StubHub in digital form. Systems failures, security breaches,theft or other disruptions 
that result in the loss of such sellers’ tickets inventory, could result in significant costs and a loss of consumer confidence in ourtickets business.
•
Lawsuits alleging a variety of causes of actions have in the past, and may in the future, be filed against StubHub and eBay by venue owners, competitors,ticket buyers, and unsuccessfu
l ticket buyers. Such lawsuits could result in significant costs and require us to change our business practices in ways thatnegatively affect ou
r tickets business.•
Our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources, including ticketing service companies, event organizers, ticket brokers,and online and offline
 ticket resellers. Some ticketing service companies,16

event organizers, and professional sports teams have begun to issue event tickets through various forms of electronic ticketing systems that are designedto restrict or prohibit the
 transferability (and by extension, the resale) of such event tickets either to favor their own resale affiliates or to discourage resaleor restrict resale of season
 tickets to a preferred, designated website. Ticketing service companies have also begun to use market-based pricing strategiesor dynamic pricing to cha
rge much higher prices, and impose additional restrictions on transferability, for premium tickets.•
Some sports teams have threatened to revoke the privileges of season ticket owners if they resell their tickets through a platform that is not affiliated with,or approved by, such sports teams. In M
arch 2015, StubHub filed suit against Ticketmaster and the Golden State Warriors, alleging antitrust and variousstate law violations ar
ising out of the defendants’ restrictive ticketing practices, which include prohibiting the resale of Warriors tickets on StubHub orany other non-Ticketmast
er secondary exchange.The listing or sale by our users of items tha
t allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeit items, mayharm our business.
The listing or sale by our users o
f unlawful, counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services, or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner, has resultedand may continue to result 
in allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities against us (including the employees and directors of our variousentities) involving ac
tivities carried out by users through our services. In a number of circumstances, third parties, including government regulators and lawenforcement offic
ials, have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws, including laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items, laws restrictingor prohibiting the transf
erability (and by extension, the resale) of digital goods (e.g., event tickets, books, music and software), the fencing of stolen goods,selective distribut
ion channel laws, customs laws, distance selling laws, anti-scalping laws with respect to the resale of tickets, and the sale of items outside of theUnited States that are r
egulated by U.S. export controls. For example:•
In Turkey, local prosecutors and courts are investigating our liability for allegedly illegal actions by users of our Turkish Marketplace business(GittiGidiyor). In accord
ance with local law and custom, they have indicted one or more members of the board of directors of our local Turkishsubsidiary. We intend to def
end vigorously against any such actions and a growing number of these cases have been dismissed by the relevant courts.•
In August 2012, we were informed that U.S. listings of footwear with religious imagery were visible on our local Indian site and we immediately removedthese listings. In Septembe
r 2012, a criminal case was registered against us in India in regard to these listings, and we are challenging the prosecution ofthis case.
In addition, allegations
 of infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to counterfeit items, have resulted in threatened and actuallitigation from ti
me to time by rights owners, including the following luxury brand owners: Tiffany & Co. in the United States; Rolex S.A. and Coty PrestigeLancaster Group GmbH in Germany; Louis Vuit
ton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture in France; and L’Oréal SA, Lancôme Parfums et Beauté & Cie, andLaboratoire Garnier & Ci
e in several European countries. Plaintiffs in these and similar suits seek, among other remedies, injunctive relief and damages. Statutorydamages for copyright or t
rademark violations could range up to $150,000 per copyright violation and $2,000,000 per trademark violation in the United States, andmay be even higher in other 
jurisdictions. In the past, we have paid substantial amounts in connection with resolving certain trademark and copyright suits. Theseand similar suits may a
lso force us to modify our business practices in a manner that increases costs, lowers revenue, makes our websites and mobile platforms lessconvenient to customers, and 
requires us to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings in order tocombat these practi
ces. In addition, we have received significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods, which could damageour reputation, diminish th
e value of our brand names, and make users reluctant to use our products and services.We are subject to risks associa
ted with information disseminated through our services.Online services companie
s may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through their services, including claims alleging defamation, libel,breach of contract, inv
asion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of online servicescompanies for informa
tion disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Any liabilitiesincurred as a result of 
these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation and our business.Our potential liabili
ty to third parties for the user-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where laws governingInternet transact
ions are unsettled, may increase. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in whichwe operate, we could be direc
tly harmed and we17

may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain serviceofferings, which could harm our bus
iness.Changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers cou
ld increase our costs and loss rate.Our eBay Money Back Guarantee program 
represents the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded, have notreceived the item that they p
urchased or have received an item different from what was described. We expect to continue to receive communications from usersrequesting reimbursement or
 threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made. Our liability for these sort of claims is slowlybeginning to be clarifi
ed in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non-U.S. jurisdictions than it is in the United States. Litigation involving liability for anysuch third-party actions 
could be costly and time consuming for us, divert management attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to adversejudgments or settlemen
ts or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us,including imposing fines or se
eking injunctions.We may be unable to adequately prot
ect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectualproperty rights.
We believe the prote
ction of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is criticalto our success. We seek to prot
ect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the United States and internationally, as well as avariety of administr
ative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services,including confidential
ity and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties withwhom we conduct business.
However, effective inte
llectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available, andcontractual arrang
ements and other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating ourintellectual prope
rty or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. Trademark, copyright, patent, domain name,trade dress and trade secret
 protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and otherproprietary rights in an 
increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every jurisdiction. Also,we may not be able to discover o
r determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in thefuture, certain of our p
roprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of ourproprietary rights or ha
rm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so,could materially ha
rm our business.As the number of products in the sof
tware industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap, and as we acquire technology throughacquisitions or licenses
, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, and trademark infringement claims. Litigationmay be necessary to determi
ne the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation isuncertain and, regardl
ess of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time andattention from our business, 
require us to stop selling, delay roll-out, or redesign our products, or require us to pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments orsettle claims or l
awsuits or to pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Ourfailure to obtain nec
essary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business.Failure to deal effect
ively with fraudulent activities on our platforms would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminishmerchant and consumer confidence in and use of our s
ervices.We face risks with respect
 to fraudulent activities on our platforms and periodically receive complaints from buyers and sellers who may not have receivedthe goods that they had contra
cted to purchase or payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase. In some European and Asian jurisdictions, buyersmay also have the right to wi
thdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period. While we can, in some cases, suspend the accounts ofusers who fail to fulfill 
their payment or delivery obligations to other users, we do not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods, orotherwise make users whole othe
r than through its buyer protection program, which in the United States we refer to as the eBay Money Back Guarantee. Althoughwe have implemented measure
s to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activities, combat bad buyer experiences and increase buyer satisfaction,including evaluating sel
lers on the basis of18

their transaction history and restricting or suspending their activity, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in combating fraudulenttransactions or improving ov
erall satisfaction among sellers, buyers, and other participants. Additional measures to address fraud could negatively affect theattractiveness of our s
ervices to buyers or sellers, resulting in a reduction in the ability to attract new users or retain current users, damage to our reputation, or adiminution in the value of ou
r brand names.We have substantial indebtedn
ess, and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from ourbusiness to service our indebtedn
ess. Failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness, which could havean adverse effect on our cash flow and l
iquidity.We have a substantial a
mount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under ourcommercial paper p
rogram and revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additionalindebtedness we incur may have s
ignificant consequences, including, without limitation, any of the following:    
•
requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing theamount of cash availabl
e for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;•
our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures, and to adverse changes in generaleconomic and industry condit
ions;•
adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costs;•
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases or other general corporate and otherpurposes may be limited; 
and•
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.Our ability to make paymen
ts of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to generaleconomic conditions, industry 
cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition, many ofwhich are beyond our control. If we 
are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, amongother things:
    
•
repatriate funds to the United States at substantial tax cost;•
seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•
refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•
sell selected assets; or•
reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.Such measures might not be suff
icient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available oneconomically favorab
le terms or at all.Our revolving credit fac
ility and the indenture pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain, and any debt instruments weenter into in the futur
e may contain, financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to payamounts due under, or breach any o
f the covenants in, a debt instrument, then the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of allborrowings thereunder (subjec
t in certain cases to grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of or default in respect of any ofour indebtedness could, in turn, cons
titute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of thatother indebtedness. Any of these ev
ents could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.A downgrade in our credit ratings could material
ly adversely affect our business.Some of our outstanding indebtedness h
as received credit ratings from certain rating agencies.  Such ratings are limited in scope and do not purport toaddress all risks rela
ting to an investment in those debt securities, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating was issued. The creditratings assigned to our debt se
curities could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject toongoing evaluation by credit 
rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a ratingagency or placed on a so-ca
lled “watch list” for a possible downgrade or assigned a negative19

ratings outlook if, in any rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any ofour debt securities. Actua
l or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for adowngrade or have been assigned a neg
ative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition, results of opera
tions, cash flows and could harm our business.Our credit ratings were downgrad
ed as a result of the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders (the"Distribution"), pursuant to which PayPal b
ecame an independent company. As of January 1, 2014, our long-term debt and short-term funding were ratedinvestment grade by Standard 
and Poor's Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated A, short-term rated A-1, with a stable outlook), Moody's Investor Service (long-term rated A2, short-te
rm rated P-1, with a stable outlook), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (long-term rated A, short-term rated F-1, with a stable outlook). All of thesecredit rating agenc
ies lowered their ratings in connection with the Distribution, which occurred on July 17, 2015. Since July 20, 2015, we have been ratedinvestment grade by Standard 
and Poor's Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term rated A-2, with a stable outlook), Moody's Investor Service(long-term rated Baa1, sho
rt-term rated P-2, with a stable outlook), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (long-term rated BBB, short-term rated F-2, with a stable outlook). Wedisclose these ratings to 
enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, inpart, on our credit rat
ings and any further actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as described above, will likely increase ourborrowing costs. 
Our business and users may be subject to sales tax and o
ther taxes.The application of indir
ect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax) to ecommercebusinesses and to our users is a comp
lex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before theadoption and growth of the Intern
et and ecommerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the Internet or ecommerce. In addition,governments are incre
asingly looking for ways to increase revenues, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase taxrevenues, including through indi
rect taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determinationis uncertain.
We do not collect taxes on 
the goods or services sold by users of our services. However, some jurisdictions have implemented, or may implement, laws thatrequire remote sel
lers of goods and services to collect and remit taxes on sales to customers located within the jurisdiction. In particular, the Streamlined Sales TaxProject (an ongoing, multi-y
ear effort by U.S. state and local governments to pursue federal legislation that would require collection and remittance of sales tax byout-of-state sellers) could all
ow states that meet certain simplification and other criteria to require out-of-state sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on goodspurchased by in-state res
idents. The adoption of such legislation could result in a use tax collection responsibility for certain of our sellers. This collectionresponsibility and the addi
tional costs associated with complex use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements would make selling on our websites andmobile platforms less 
attractive for small business retailers and would harm our business, and the proliferation of state legislation to expand sales and use taxcollection on Interne
t sales could adversely affect some of our sellers and indirectly harm our business.Several proposals have been m
ade at the U.S. state and local levels that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the Internet.These proposals, if adopted, could subs
tantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands, and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefitfrom our activities. While the
 U.S. federal government’s moratorium on state and local taxation of Internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes onecommerce has been temporarily e
xtended, this moratorium does not prohibit federal, state or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or fromcollecting certa
in taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium and/or one of its extensions.From time to time, some 
taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on our services. Thesenotifications have not r
esulted in any significant tax liabilities to date, but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful in the future, which would harmour business.
Similar issues exist outsid
e of the United States, where the application of VAT or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers is complex and evolving.While we attempt to co
mply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due, some of our subsidiaries have, from time to time, received claims relating tothe applicability of 
indirect taxes to our fees. We have been paying VAT on fees charged to certain of our users in the European Union based on the serviceprovider’s location. On January 1, 2015, 
changes to the rules determining the place of supply (and thus the country of taxation) for all European Union basedproviders of electroni
cally supplied services were implemented that require that we pay VAT based on the residence or normal place of business of our customers.These changes may result in ou
r paying a higher rate of VAT on such fees. Additionally, we20

pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from thevarious countries. However, becaus
e of our unique business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. Asuccessful assertion by one or 
more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.In certain jurisdic
tions, we collect and remit indirect taxes on our fees and pay taxes on our purchases of goods and services. However, tax authorities mayraise questions about our ca
lculation, reporting and collection of taxes and may ask us to remit additional taxes, as well as the proper calculation of such taxes.Should any new taxes become applic
able or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient, our business could be harmed.A taxing authority may seek to 
impose a tax collection, reporting or record-keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Forexample, the U.S. Internal Revenu
e Service (IRS) now requires that certain payments to sellers be reported to the sellers and the IRS on an annual basis. Anyfailure by us to meet th
ese requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our business. Taxing authorities mayalso seek to impose tax col
lection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction,regardless of where the r
espective users are located. Some jurisdictions could assert that we are responsible for tax on the underlying goods or services sold on oursites. Imposition of a re
cord keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business. Tax authorities may alsorequire us to help ensure co
mpliance by our users by promulgating legislation regulating professional sellers, including tax reporting and collection requirements.In addition, we have periodic
ally received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellerson our sites, and in some cases we hav
e been legally obligated to provide this data. The imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for allor a class of sellers to 
tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers, especially requirements that are imposed on us but not onalternative means o
f ecommerce, and any use of those records to investigate, collect taxes from or prosecute sellers, could decrease seller activity on our sites andharm our business.
We may have exposure to greater than an
ticipated tax liabilities.The determination of our wor
ldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are manytransactions and calcu
lations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S.and foreign tax jurisdic
tions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit andreview by applicable domes
tic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authoritiesthroughout the world, including with r
espect to our business structure. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimatetax outcome may differ from t
he amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for whichsuch determination is m
ade. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities,these reserves may prove 
to be insufficient.In addition, our future inco
me taxes could be adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional earning mix, by changes in the valuation of our deferred taxassets and liabiliti
es, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as wellas certain discrete items.
In light of continuing fisc
al challenges in certain U.S. states and in many countries in Europe, various levels of government are increasingly focused on taxreform and other legis
lative action to increase tax revenue, including corporate income taxes. For example, the economic downturn reduced tax revenues forUnited States federal and s
tate governments, and a number of proposals to increase taxes from corporate entities have been implemented or are being considered atvarious levels of governmen
t. These include a number of proposals to modify the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to companies, like ours, operating inmultiple U.S. and foreign jurisd
ictions which, if enacted, could materially increase our effective tax rate. A number of U.S. states have attempted to increasecorporate tax revenues by 
taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes oncompanies that have no physic
al presence in their state, and taxing authorities in foreign jurisdictions may take similar actions. Many U.S. states are also alteringtheir apportionment formulas
 to increase the amount of taxable income or loss attributable to their state from certain out-of-state businesses. Similarly, in Europe,and elsewhere in the 
world, there are various tax reform efforts underway designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of theirearnings. Companies that oper
ate over the Internet, such as eBay, are a target of some of these efforts. If more taxing authorities are successful in applying directtaxes to Internet comp
anies that do not have a physical presence in their respective jurisdictions, this could increase our effective tax rate.21

We may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations.One or more states, the U.S. feder
al government or foreign countries may seek to impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engagein or facilitate 
ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance (and legislation to such effect has beencontemplated by severa
l states and a number of foreign jurisdictions) or if one of our companies was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our servicesby a jurisdiction in which it op
erates. Certain of our companies are required to report to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on customers subject to U.S. incometax who receive more than $20,000 
in payments and more than 200 payments in a calendar year. As a result, we are required to request tax identification numbersfrom certain payees, 
track payments by tax identification number and, under certain conditions, withhold a portion of payments and forward such withholding tothe IRS. We have modified our syst
ems to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our user experience in connection withcomplying with these report
ing obligations. Any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions andcould harm our business.
Our business is subject to online secur
ity risks, including security breaches and cyberattacks.Our businesses involve the storage 
and transmission of users’ personal financial information. In addition, a significant number of our users authorize us tobill their payment c
ard accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. An increasing number of websites, including those owned by several otherlarge Internet and of
fline companies, have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portionsof their websites or infr
astructure. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently, may bedifficult to detec
t for a long time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Certain efforts may be state sponsored and supported by significantfinancial and technological re
sources and therefore may be even more difficult to detect. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or toimplement adequate preventative mea
sures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, includinghacking into our systems or fa
cilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff. A party that is able to circumventour security measures cou
ld misappropriate our or our users’ personal information, cause interruption or degradations in our operations, damage our computers orthose of our users, or otherwise da
mage our reputation. In addition, our users have been and likely will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent “spoof”and “phishing” emails to m
isappropriate user names, passwords, payment card numbers, or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malwarethrough “trojan horse” progr
ams to our users’ computers. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security incidentsand third parties may be 
able to access our users’ proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our systems. Any securitybreach at a company provid
ing services to us or our users could have similar effects.In May 2014, we publicly announced that 
criminals were able to penetrate and steal certain data, including user names, encrypted user passwords and othernon-financial user dat
a. Upon making this announcement, we required all buyers and sellers on our platform to reset their passwords in order to log into theiraccount. The breach and subsequen
t password reset have negatively impacted the business. In July 2014, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us foralleged violations and ha
rm resulting from the breach. The lawsuit was recently dismissed with leave to amend. In addition, we have received requests forinformation and are subj
ect to investigations regarding this incident from numerous regulatory and other government agencies across the world.We may also need to expend sign
ificant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches. These issues arelikely to become more d
ifficult and costly as we expand the number of markets where we operate. Additionally, our insurance policies carry low coverage limits,which may not be adequate to r
eimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able to fully collect, if at all, under these insurance policies.Systems failures or cyberattac
ks and resulting interruptions in the availability of or degradation in the performance of our websites, applications, productsor services could harm our business.
Our systems may experience s
ervice interruptions or degradation due to of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service andother cyberattacks, hum
an error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, militaryor political confli
cts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, or other events. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism.Some of our systems are not ful
ly redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.22

We have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time thatinterrupt the avail
ability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss ofrevenue. A prolonged interrupt
ion in the availability or reduction in the speed or other functionality of our websites and mobile applications could materially harmour business. Frequent or persisten
t interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them toswitch to our competitors or 
to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similarevent results in damages 
to our customers or their businesses, these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses and those claims, evenif unsuccessful, would likely be 
time-consuming and costly for us to address. We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties and ourbusiness may be materia
lly adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide theservices or facili
ties. In particular, a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility that we use could cause system interruptions and delays,result in loss of criti
cal data and cause lengthy interruptions in our services. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for lossesthat may result from interrupti
ons in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.Acquisitions, dispositions, joint 
ventures, and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business.We have acquired a signi
ficant number of businesses of varying size and scope, technologies, services, and products and have recently distributed 100% ofthe outstanding common stock of PayPa
l to our stockholders, pursuant to which PayPal became an independent company, and sold our Enterprise business. Wealso expect to continue to 
evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including businesscombinations, acquisitions, 
and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. .These transactions may invo
lve significant challenges and risks, including:•
the potential loss of key customers, merchants, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following andcontinuing after announce
ment of our transaction plans;•
declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes incompensation, or changes in m
anagement, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•
difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees;•
diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the businesses to the transaction, and in the case of an acquisition, integration andadministration;
•
the need to provide transition services to a disposed of company, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus;•
the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems),technologies, products and personn
el of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•
the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures thatmay arise as a result;
•
the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition mayhave lacked such controls, pro
cedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and other standards;•
risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•
derivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or disposition;•
liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes,violations of laws, rules and r
egulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and, in the case of dispositions,liabilities to the 
acquirors of those businesses under contractual provisions such as representations, warranties and indemnities;•
the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•
the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information by us or a third party acquiring assets or businesses from us, which in and of itselfmay require regulato
ry approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure; and•
our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes and the risk thaterrors or irregularities in th
ose systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statements or make it more difficult tomanage the acquired busin
ess.23

At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of these transactionscould be material to ou
r financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits ofthese transactions, and
 those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business andoperating results. Any acquisi
tions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interestexpense), liabiliti
es, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations anddilute the economic and vo
ting rights of our stockholders.    
We have made certa
in investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management and operationalcontrol. The controlling jo
int venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and businessdecisions or other actions o
r omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affectthe value of our investmen
t in the joint venture. Our strategic investments may also expose us to additional risks. Any circumstances, which may be out of ourcontrol, that adversely 
affect the value of our investments, or cost resulting from regulatory action or lawsuits in connection with our investments, could harm ourbusiness or negativel
y impact our financial results.Our success largely depends on key personn
el. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop thehighly skilled employees we n
eed to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business.Our future performance d
epends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including key engineering andproduct development personne
l, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the SiliconValley where our corporate h
eadquarters are located, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. Inmaking employment decis
ions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they wouldreceive in connection wit
h their employment and fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. In addition,we do not have long-term employ
ment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of theservices of any of our senior 
management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, couldharm our business.
Problems with or price increases by third par
ties who provide services to us or to our sellers could harm our business.A number of third parties prov
ide services to us or to our sellers. Such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings, merchant tools thatmanage listings and inte
rface with inventory management software, storefronts that help our sellers list items and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on ourplatform, among others. Finan
cial or regulatory issues, labor issues (e.g., strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages), or other problems that prevent these companiesfrom providing services to us o
r our sellers could harm our business.Price increases by, or serv
ice terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that provide services to us and our sellers and clients could also reducethe number of listings on our pl
atforms or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions, thereby harming our business. Some third parties whoprovide services to us or our se
llers may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint. In addition, the U.S.Postal Service, which is facing ongo
ing fiscal challenges, has instituted postal rate increases and announced that it is considering closing thousands of local postoffices and ending Saturday m
ail delivery. While we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance theirshipping experience, 
postal rate increases may reduce the competitiveness of certain sellers’ offerings, and postal service changes could require certain sellers toutilize alterna
tives which could be more expensive or inconvenient, which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on our sites, thereby harming ourbusiness.
We have outsourced cert
ain functions to third-party providers, including some customer support and product development functions, which are critical to ouroperations. If our servic
e providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which could result in user dissatisfaction and could harm ourbusiness.
There can be no assurance th
at third parties who provide services directly to us or our sellers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any thirdparties were to stop providing s
ervices to us or our sellers on acceptable terms, including24

as a result of bankruptcy, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and 
third-party developers, subject us to additional risks.We provide third-party d
evelopers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to allow them toproduce applications for us
e, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party developers will develop andmaintain applicat
ions and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail orstop development for our pla
tforms. In addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers whoutilize our developmen
t platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm ourbusiness.
 
The Distribution may not achieve some or all o
f the anticipated benefits and may adversely affect our business.We may not realize so
me or all of the anticipated benefits from the Distribution and the Distribution may in fact adversely affect our business. As anindependent, publicly trad
ed company, we will be a smaller, less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changingmarket conditions, which could 
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Separating the businesses may alsoeliminate or reduc
e synergies or economies of scale that existed prior to the Distribution, which could harm our business.We could incur significant 
liability if the Distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.We
 have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the Distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355 and368(a)(1)(D)
 of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from PayPal and us regarding thepast
 and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrector not satisfied, our shareho
lders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding theopinion
 of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that the Distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions,representations
 or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the Distribution is determined to betaxable
 for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income taxliabilities.
We may be exposed to claims and liabi
lities as a result of the Distribution.We entered into a sepa
ration and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the Distribution and the relationship of thetwo companies going forward. These ag
reements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal. Theindemnity rights we have aga
inst PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us. In addition, our indemnity obligations to PayPal may besignificant and these r
isks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.25

ITEM 3: 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     Litigation and Other Legal Matters
Overview
We are involved in lega
l and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminateamount of damages. If we bel
ieve that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in ourfinancial statem
ents. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likelyoutcome; if none of the es
timates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in whichan unfavorable outcome is 
reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we haveconcluded that an estim
ate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid injudgment or settlemen
t) are not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we havedisclosed that fact. In 
assessing the materiality of a proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as thepotential impact of non
-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that couldhave a material adv
erse impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Item 3, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of lossesthat could potentially res
ult from the application of such non-monetary remedies.Amounts accrued for legal 
and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the year ended December 31, 2015.Except as otherwise noted for 
the proceedings described in this Item 3, we have concluded, based on currently available information, that reasonably possiblelosses arising directly 
from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also notmaterial. However, legal a
nd regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolvedagainst us in a reporting pe
riod for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial condition for that reportingperiod could be material.
Litigation
eBay Inc., eBay Domestic Holdings, Inc., Pie
rre Omidyar and Joshua Silverman have been sued by craigslist, Inc. in California Superior Court in SanFrancisco (Case No.:  CGC - 08 - 475276). craigslis
t filed suit on May 13, 2008 alleging that we engaged in conduct designed to harm craigslist's business whilewe negotiated to become and whi
le we were a minority shareholder in craigslist. craigslist’s allegations include that we (i) misrepresented, concealed, suppressedand failed to disclose fact
s in order to induce craigslist to take detrimental action; (ii) interfered with craigslist's business operations; (iii) improperly26

disseminated and misused confidential and proprietary information from craigslist that we received as a minority investor; (iv) infringed and diluted craigslist'strademark and trade n
ame; and (v) breached duties owed to craigslist. The complaint seeks significant compensatory and punitive damages, rescission and otherrelief. In addition, in Sep
tember 2014, craigslist filed an amended complaint alleging trade secret misappropriation and seeking new and additional compensatoryand punitive damages. The ma
tter was settled in June 2015 and the lawsuit has been dismissed.In March 2015, StubHub filed suit agains
t Ticketmaster and the Golden State Warriors, alleging antitrust and various state law violations arising out of thedefendants’ restric
tive ticketing practices, which include prohibiting the resale of Warriors tickets on StubHub or any other non-Ticketmaster secondary exchange(StubHub, Inc. v. Golden State Warriors, LLC e
t al, N.D. Cal. No. 3:15-cv-01436). StubHub filed a First Amended Complaint on June 30, 2015. The defendantsfiled a Motion to Dismiss the Am
ended Complaint which was granted in November 2015. StubHub is appealing this decision.Regulatory Proceedings
In May 2014, we publicly announced that 
criminals were able to penetrate our network and steal certain data, including user names, encrypted userpasswords and other non-financia
l user data. Upon making this announcement, we required all buyers and sellers on our platform to reset their passwords in orderto login to their account. 
In addition to making this public announcement, we proactively approached a number of regulatory and governmental bodies, includingthose with the most direct sup
ervisory authority over our data privacy and data security programs, to specifically inform them of the incident and our actions toprotect our customers in 
response. Certain of those regulatory agencies have requested us to provide further, more detailed information regarding the incident, andwe believe that we have ful
ly cooperated in all of those requests. To date, we have not been informed by any regulatory authority of an intention to bring anyenforcement action 
arising from this incident; however, in the future we may be subject to fines or other regulatory action.  In addition, in July 2014, a putativeclass action lawsuit was fi
led against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the incident. The lawsuit was recently dismissed with leave to amend.General Matters
Other third parties have
 from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We aresubject to patent disputes, 
and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as ourproducts and services continu
e to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against ourcustomers (who may be entit
led to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a result ofour acquisitions and divesti
tures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may alsobecome more vulnerabl
e to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act areinterpreted by the cour
ts, and as we expand the scope of our business (both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographicaloperations) and become subj
ect to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves areeither unclear or l
ess favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us.Intellectual prope
rty claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods ofdoing business or could require us to 
enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms.From time to time, we ar
e involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our users(individually or as class 
actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices, rules, policies orcustomer/user agreements violate
 applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies or agreements.Further, the number and signif
icance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in termsof the range of products and se
rvices that we offer and our geographical operations) and our products and services have increased in complexity. Any claims orregulatory actions aga
inst us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages forcertain causes of ac
tion in certain jurisdictions), injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to changeour business practices in exp
ensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwiseharm our business.
Indemnification Provisions
We entered into a sepa
ration and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship of the twocompanies going forward. These ag
reements provide for specific indemnity and liability27

obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal, which may be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under theagreements may not be suf
ficient to protect us and our indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.In the ordinary course of busin
ess, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we havecommercial relations, including
 our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these contracts, wegenerally indemnify, hold h
armless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claimsby a third party with respec
t to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performanceunder the subject agree
ment. In certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement. It is not possible to determine themaximum potential loss und
er these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstancesinvolved in each particu
lar provision. To date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have notbeen significant, either in
dividually or collectively.ITEM 4:

In January 2014, our Board authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the d
ate of authorization. In January 2015, our Board authorized an additional  $2 billion  stock repurchase program, wi th noexpiration from the da
te of authorization. In June 2015, our Board authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration fromthe date of authoriza
tion. The stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensationprograms and, in addition, subje
ct to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstandingshare count. Any share repurchas
es under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiatedtransactions (including accelerate
d share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and willbe funded from our working capit
al or other financing alternatives.During 
2015 , we repurchased approximat ely  $2.1 billion  of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2015 , a total of approximately 
$1.8 billion remained availabl e for future repurchases of our common stock under our January 2015 and June 2015 repurchase programs and noamount remained avai
lable under our January 2014 repurchase program. We expect, subject to m
arket conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic repurchases of our common stock. However, our stockrepurchase programs may b
e limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a varietyof factors including cor
porate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of ourcash.

eBay Inc. is a global comme
rce leader, including our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Our Marketplace platforms include our onlinemarketplace loca
ted at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. Our StubHub platforms include our online ticket platform located atwww.stubhub.com and the StubHub mobile apps. Our Classifieds p
latforms include a collection of brands such as Mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBayClassifieds and others. 
On July 17, 2015, we completed the distribu
tion of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal") to our stockholders (the"Distribution"), pursuant to which PayPal b
ecame an independent company. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, PayPal's financial results for periods prior tothe Distribution have been r
eflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operations. Additionally, the related assets andliabilities associ
ated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet are classified as discontinued operations. Pursuant to the terms ofthe separation and distr
ibution agreement entered into between us and PayPal on June 26, 2015, upon Distribution, assets related to the PayPal business weretransferred to, and li
abilities related to the PayPal business were retained or assumed by, PayPal.During the second quarter of 2015, our Boa
rd of Directors ("Board") approved a plan to sell the businesses underlying our former Enterprise segment("Enterprise"). As a result, 
the Enterprise financial results were reflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operationsbeginning in the second quarte
r of 2015. On July 16, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Enterprise and on November 2, 2015, the sale closed. As aresult, the related 
assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet are classified as discontinuedoperations.
In January 2015, at a regular 
meeting of our Board, our Board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of our existing global workforce. Thereduction was completed in 
the first half of 2015 and is expected to generate annual savings of more than $150 million, primarily impacting sales and marketingand product development expens
es. The savings in these line items are expected to be offset by additional expenses as we reinvest back into these areas of thebusiness to drive additional g
rowth.We have incurred signif
icant costs in connection with the Distribution and sale of Enterprise. These costs relate primarily to third-party advisory andconsulting services, ret
ention payments to certain employees, incremental stock-based compensation and other costs directly related to the Distribution and the saleof Enterprise. The major
ity of these costs are reflected in our consolidated statement of income as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The remainingcosts reflected in con
tinuing operations are classified within cost of net revenues, sales and marketing, product development or general and administrative in ourconsolidated statement of i
ncome as applicable.33

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange RatesOur commerce platfor
ms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound,Korean won and Australian dollar, subj
ecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We calculate the year-over-year impactof foreign currency move
ments using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts. The foreign exchange ("FX")neutral, or constant cur
rency, net revenue amounts are non-GAAP financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared inaccordance with genera
lly accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The information in this section should be read in connection with the information in "Non-GAAP Measure of Financial Performanc
e."Because we generated a ma
jority of our net revenues internationally, including the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign coun
tries as discussed under "Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors."The following table sets for

(1)We define exchange rate effect as  the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to currentyear transactional 
currency amounts.(2)
We define FX-Neutral Gross Merch andise Volume as Gross Merchandise Volume minus the exchange rate effect. We define the non-GAAP financialmeasures of FX-Neutral net r
evenue as net revenue minus the exchange rate effect.(3)
We define Gross Merchandise Volu me ("GMV") as the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace and StubHubplatforms during the appl
icable period regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction. We believe that GMV provides auseful measure of the ove
rall volume of closed transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in GMV ofclosed transactions that are
 not ultimately consummated.(4)
During the first quarter o f 2014, we revised our definition of GMV for certain transactions to align more closely with our operating metrics. 2013 amountshave been revised to confor
m to the current period reporting definition.In 
2015 , foreign currency movem ents relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted cost of net revenues by $80 million (inclusive of a positive impact ofapproximately  
$24 million  from hedging activiti es). In 2014 , foreign currency movem ents relative to the U.S. dollar had an immaterial impact on cost of netrevenues.
In 
2015 , foreign currency movem ents relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted operating expenses by $194 million (inclusive of a positive impact ofapproximately  
$47 million  from hedging activiti es). In 2014 , foreign currency movem ents relative to the U.S. dollar had an immaterial impact on operatingexpenses.
The effect of foreign 
currency exchange rate movements during 2015 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily theEuro, the British pound, and the Korean won.

Results of OperationsSummary of Net Revenues
We generate two types of ne
t revenues: net transaction revenues and marketing services and other revenues. Net transaction revenues are derived principallyfrom final value fe
es (which are fees payable on transactions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms), listing fees and other service fees. Marketingservices and other revenu
es consists of Marketplace and Classifieds revenue principally from the sale of advertisements, vehicles classifieds listing on Marketplaceplatforms, revenue sharin
g arrangements, classifieds fees, marketing service fees and lead referral fees. To drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives toour users in the form of coupons and buy
er and seller rewards. These incentives are generally treated as reductions in revenue.The following table sets for
th the breakdown of net revenues by type and geography for the periods presented.

Net transaction revenues d
ecreased $152 million , or 2% , while GMV decreased 1% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . Net transaction revenue represented 79% of total net revenues in bo
th 2015 in 2014. The decrease in net transaction revenues and GMV was driven primarily by a negative impact from foreign currencymovements relative 
to the U.S. dollar. FX-Neutral net transaction revenue and FX-Neutral GMV increased 4% and 5% respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014 . The FX-Neutral GMV increase of 
5% was driven by an increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace GMV, and to a lesser extent, StubHub GMV. The total transactiontake rate was lower in 
2015 compared to 2014 due to decrease in our Mark etplace transaction take rate, partially offset by an increase in our StubHub transactiontake rate.
37

Marketplace net transaction revenues decreased $248 million , or 4% , while Marketplace GMV decreased 2% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . The decrease in Marketplace net tr
ansaction revenues and Marketplace GMV was driven primarily by a negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S.dollar. FX-Neutral Marketpl
ace net transaction revenue and FX-Neutral Marketplace GMV increased 3% and 5% respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. The FX-Neutral Marketplace GMV inc
rease of 5% was driven primarily by an increase in volume in local currencies on our Marketplace platforms internationally and to alesser extent, the U.S. The incr
ease in FX-Neutral Marketplace net transaction revenue was less than the increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace GMV due to a lowerMarketplace transaction take rate.
 The Marketplace transaction take rate was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a shift in geographic al and vertical mix, aswell as an increase in our buy
er and seller incentives, which are accounted for as a reduction of revenue.StubHub net transaction revenues 
increased $96 million , or 15% , while StubHub GMV increased 13% in 2015 compared to 2014 . The increase in StubHub net transaction revenues was d
riven primarily by an increase in StubHub GMV and an increase in StubHub transaction take rate. The StubHub GMVincrease was driven prim
arily by an increase in volume of ticket sales related to Sports and Concerts. The increase in StubHub net transaction revenue was greaterthan the increase in StubHub GMV due to a high
er StubHub transaction take rate. The StubHub transaction take rate was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to a change 
in mix of events and sellers on the StubHub platforms.Net transaction revenues 
increased  $427 million , or  7% , while GMV increased 8% in 2014 compared to 2013 . Net transaction revenue represented 79% of total net revenues in bo
th 2014 and 2013. The GMV increase of 8% was driven primarily by an increase in Marketplace GMV, and to a lesser extent, an increasein StubHub GMV. The total transaction tak
e rate was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a decrease in our Ma rketplace transaction take rate and our StubHubtransaction take rate.
Marketplace net transaction reve
nues increased  $451 million , or  8% , and Marketplace GMV increased 9% in 2014 compared to 2013 . The GMV increase of 
9% was driven primarily by an increase in volume on our Marketplace platforms internationally and to a lesser extent, the U.S. Our Marketplace net transactionrevenue growth decelera
ted in the second half of 2014 caused by a reduction in traffic from lower organic traffic, such as Google's search engine algorithmchanges and the cyberatt
ack that occurred in the second quarter of 2014. The Marketplace transaction take rate was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarilyto an increase in our buyer 
and seller incentives, which are accounted for as a reduction of revenue.StubHub net transaction revenues d
ecreased $24 million , or 4% , while StubHub GMV increased 2% in 2014 compared to 2013 . The decrease in StubHub net transaction revenu
es was driven primarily by a decrease in StubHub transaction take rate, offset by an increase in StubHub GMV. The StubHub transactiontake rate was lower in 2014 comp
ared to 2013 due to pricing changes on the StubHub platforms. The StubHub GMV increase was driven primarily by an increasein volume of ticket sal
es related to Sports and Theater.Net transaction revenues
 earned internationally totaled $3.8 billion , $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, repres enting 55% , 57% 
and 56% of total net transaction reve nues in the respective periods. Net transaction revenues earned internationally as a percentage of total net transactionrevenue decreased in 
2015 compared to 2014 , primarily due to a nega tive impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. Net transactionrevenues earned internationall
y as a percentage of total net transaction revenue increased in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to a gre ater increase inrevenues earned intern
ationally.Marketing Services and Other Revenues
Marketing services and oth
er revenues decreased $46 million , or 3% , in 2015 compared to 2014 , and represented 21% of total net revenues in bo thperiods. The decrease was driv
en primarily by a negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. FX-Neutral marketing services andother revenues increased 
8% in 2015 compared to 2014 . The FX-Neutral marketing serv ices and other revenues increase was driven by increased FX-NeutralClassifieds revenue, and to a 
lesser extent, increased FX-Neutral revenue in our Marketplace marketing services.Marketplace marke
ting services and other revenues decreased $25 million , or 2% , in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by anegative impact fro
m foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. FX-Neutral Marketplace marketing services and other revenues increased by 4% in2015 compared to 2014. The increas
e in FX-Neutral Marketplace marketing services and other revenues was primarily driven by increased fees earned for referralservices offset by decrease
d revenue in local currencies from advertising display on our Marketplace international platforms. The increase in fees earned forreferral servic
es consist primarily of fees for customers acquired and incentives for the usage of PayPal products on certain Marketplace platforms, which were notincluded in marketing se
rvices and other revenues prior to the Distribution.38

Classifieds marketing services and other revenues decreased $13 million , or 2% , in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by anegative impact fro
m foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. FX-Neutral Classifieds marketing services and other revenues increased by 15% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increas
e in FX-Neutral Classifieds marketing services and other revenues was driven primarily by increased revenue from ourClassifieds platforms in ou
r developed markets of Germany, Canada and the UK.Marketing services and oth
er revenues increased  $106 million , or  6% , in  2014  compared to  2013 , and represented  21%  of total net revenues fo r bothperiods. The increase in m
arketing services and other revenues was driven primarily by increased Classifieds revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased revenue inour Marketplace mark
eting services.Marketplace marke
ting services and other revenues increased $13 million , or 1% , in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in Marketplace marketingservices and other revenu
es was primarily driven by revenue from advertising displayed on our Marketplace international platforms.Classifieds marketing se

Sales and marketing expenses 
consist primarily of advertising costs and marketing programs (both online and offline), employee compensation, contractorcosts, facilities cos
ts and depreciation on equipment. Online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search,affiliates marketing and displa
y advertising. Offline advertising includes primarily brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.Sales and marketing expense d
ecreased by $175 million , or 7% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . The decrease in sales and marketing expense was dueprimarily to the posit
ive impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar, a decrease in marketing program costs due in part to a shift in certainbuyer and seller incent
ives (for which associated expenses are recorded as a reduction in revenue instead of sales and marketing expense) and employee-relatedsavings from our global workforc
e reduction. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenues were 26% and 28% in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Sales and marketing expense 
increased by  $298 million , or  14% , in  2014  compared to  2013 . The increase in sales and marketing expense was dueprimarily to an incr
ease in marketing program costs (both online and offline programs), our brand campaign and higher employee-related expenses (includingconsultant costs). Sales and m
arketing expense as a percentage of net revenues were  28%  and  26%  in  2014  and  2013 , respectively.  
Product Development
 
Product development expenses cons
ist primarily of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Productdevelopment expenses are
 net of required capitalization of major platforms and other product development efforts, including the development of our platformarchitecture, migration of certain 
platforms, and seller tools. Our top technology priorities include structured data, multi-screen capabilities, improved seller toolsand buyer experiences.
Capitalized interna
l use and platform development costs were $136 million and $144 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and are primarily reflected asa cost of net revenues when amo
rtized in future periods.40

Product development expenses decreased by $60 million , or 6% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . The decrease was due prima rily to the positive impact fromforeign currency movem
ents and hedging relative to the U.S. dollar. Product development expenses as a net percentage of revenues were 11% in both 2015 and 2014 
. Product development expenses in
creased by  $68 million , or  7% , in  2014  compared to  2013 . The increase was due prima rily to higher employee-relatedcosts (including consultant 
costs) driven by increased investment in platforms and mobile. Product development expenses as a net percentage of revenues were 11% 
 in both  2014  and  2013 . General and Administrative
 
General and administrative e
xpenses consist primarily of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, employerpayroll taxes on stock-based 
compensation, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. Our legal expenses, including those related tovarious ongoing legal proceed
ings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.General and administra
tive expenses increased $233 million , or 26% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . The increase was due prima rily to restructuring costsrelated to our global workfo
rce reduction, costs related to the Distribution (as discussed in Overview above), expenses related to craigslist, Inc. litigationproceedings and an increas
e in corporate costs due to a reduction in synergies that existed prior to the Distribution. General and administrative expenses as apercentage of net rev
enues were 13% in 2015 and 10% in 2014 . General and administra
tive expenses increased  $9 million , or  1% , in  2014  compared to  2013 . The increase was due prima rily to higher employee-related costs. General 
and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were  10%  in 2014  and 11% in  2013 .   
Provision for Transaction Losses
Provision for transaction loss
es consists primarily of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud and bad debt expenseassociated with our accounts 
receivable balance. We expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to ourcustomer protection prog
rams and the impact of regulatory changes.Provision for transaction loss
es increased by $9 million , or 3% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . This increase was driven pri marily by higher customerprotection program costs, p
artially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense. Provision for transaction loss expense as a percentage of net revenues was 3% in both2015 
and 2014 . Provision for transaction loss
es increased by  $26 million , or  11% , in  2014  compared to  2013 . This increase was driven pri marily by an increase intransaction volume, par
tially offset by improvements in our fraud detection models. Provision for transaction loss expense as a percentage of net revenues was  3%  in both  
2014  and  2013 , respectively. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
From time to time we have pu
rchased, and we expect to continue to purchase, assets and businesses. These purchase transactions generally result in thecreation of acquired 
intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a corresponding increase in our amortization expense in periods subsequent to acquisition. Weamortize intangibl
e assets over the period of estimated benefit, using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to six years.Amortization of acquir
ed intangible assets is also impacted by our sales of assets and businesses and timing of acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized.See "Note 5 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets" 
to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.Amortization of acquir
ed intangible assets decreased by $34 million , or 45% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . The decrease was due to cer tain intangible assetsbecoming fully amorti
zed during the year.Amortization of acquir
ed intangible assets decreased by  $61 million , or  45% , in 2014 compared to 2013 . The decrease was due to cer tain intangibleassets becoming fully amo
rtized during the year.41

Interest and Other, Net 
Interest and other, net 
consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as foreign exchange transaction gains andlosses, our portion of operating 
results from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, investment gain/loss on acquisitions or disposalsand interest expense, consis
ting of interest charges on any amounts borrowed and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement andinterest expense on our outst
anding debt securities and commercial paper, if any.Interest and other, net, 
increased $170 million in 2015 compared to 2014 . The increase in inter est and other, net was due primarily to gains on sale ofinvestments partial
ly offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of debt securities in July 2014 and a decrease in interest income due to a loweroverall cash, short-te
rm investments and long-term investments balances after the Distribution.Interest and other, net, d
ecreased  $78 million  in  2014  compared to  2013 . The decrease in inter est and other, net was due primarily to a gain on the sale ofcertain investments 
in September 2013.Provision for Income Taxes
 
Year Ended December 31,  
2015  2014  2013  
(In millions) Provision for income taxes
$ 459  $3,380  $504 Effective tax rate
19 %  134 %  20 %Our effective tax rate was 
19% in 2015 compared to 134% in 2014 . The decrease in our eff ective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the recognition in 2014 of de
ferred tax liabilities of approximately $3.0 billion of U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on $9.0 billion ofundistributed foreign ea
rnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. This was partially offset by the tax effect of gains on sale of certaininvestments in 2015.
Our effective tax ra
te was  134%  in  2014  compared to  20%  in 2013. The increase in our ef fective tax rate during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to the re
cognition of deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for 2013 and prior yearsdiscussed above, partially o
ffset by the release of the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryover. 
Our relative pretax e
arnings and revenues attributable to the U.S. as compared to the rest of the world may differ over time. For the year ended December31, 2015, our U.S. share of pretax income and n
et revenues was 16.5% and 42.2% , respectively. For the yea r ended December 31, 2014, our U.S. share of pretaxincome and net revenues was 
20.3% and 40.1% , respectively. The diff erence in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the U.S., as compared tothe rest of the world for both 2015 
and 2014, was primarily related to larger stock-based compensation expense recorded in the U.S. for U.S. based employees,overhead related to our 
corporate operations which are primarily U.S. based and higher average margins earned by non-U.S. businesses. 
Our provision for income taxes d
iffers from the provision computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to lower tax ratesassociated with certa
in earnings from our operations in certain lower-tax jurisdictions outside the U.S. The impact on our provision for income taxes of foreignincome being taxed at di
fferent rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $399 million in 2015, $432 million in 2014 and $403million in 2013. We benefi
t from tax rulings concluded in several different jurisdictions, most significantly Switzerland and Luxembourg. These rulings providefor significantly lower 
rates of taxation on certain classes of income. The cash benefit of these reduced rates totaled approximately $319 million in 2015, $339million in 2014 and $328 million 
in 2013. The foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision for income taxes inthe periods presented inc
lude Switzerland and Luxembourg. See "Note 17 - Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for moreinformation on our tax ra
te reconciliation.Our provision for income taxes 
is volatile and, in general, is adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower taxrates and higher than ant
icipated in countries that have higher tax rates. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes andforeign withholding taxes assoc
iated with $6 billion of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest those earningsindefinitely in our for
eign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed into the U.S. in the form of dividends to eBay companies domiciled in the U.S.42

or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject toan adjustment for fore
ign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions andcommitments, our incom
e in certain countries including Switzerland and Luxembourg, is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments couldadversely impact our prov
ision for income taxes. Additionally, please see the information in "Item 1A: Risk Factors" under the caption "We may have exposure togreater than anticipated tax liabilitie
s."From time to time, we engag
e in certain intercompany transactions and legal entity restructurings. We consider many factors when evaluating thesetransactions, including th
e alignment of our corporate structure with our organizational objectives and the operational and tax efficiency of our corporate structure,as well as the long-term 
cash flows and cash needs of our different businesses. These transactions may impact our overall tax rate and/or result in additional cashtax payments. The impact 
in any period may be significant. These transactions may be complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may bedifficult to estimate.
We are regularly under examinati
on by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for anyadjustments that may ul
timately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the inherent uncertainties in theseexaminations. Due to the ongoing t
ax examinations, we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments.Discontinued Operations
On July 17, 2015, we completed the Distribut
ion, pursuant to which PayPal became an independent company. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015,PayPal's historical fi
nancial results for periods prior to the Distribution have been reflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, asdiscontinued operations. Addition
ally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet areclassified as discontinu
ed operations. Pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement entered into between us and PayPal on June 26, 2015, uponDistribution, assets rela
ted to the PayPal business were transferred to, and liabilities related to the PayPal business were retained or assumed by, PayPal. See "Note4 - Discontinued Operations" to our conso
lidated financial statements included in this report.During the second quarter of 2015, our Boa
rd approved a plan to sell Enterprise. As a result, the Enterprise financial results were reflected in ourconsolidated statemen
t of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of 2015. On July 16, 2015, we signed a definitiveagreement to sell Ent
erprise and on November 2, 2015, the sale closed. As a result, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations inthe prior year consolida
ted balance sheet are classified as discontinued operations. See "Note 4 - Discontinued Operations" to our consolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.
Non-GAAP Measure of Financial Performance
To supplement our consolidated 
financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we use FX-Neutralnet revenues, which are non-GAAP financi
al measures. We define the FX-Neutral net revenue as net revenue minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchangerate effect as the year-over-year impact
 of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currencyamounts.
These non-GAAP measures are not in acco
rdance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In add
ition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in 
that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.These measures should only be used to 
evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.Reconciliation of FX-neutra
l net revenues to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found in the table under "Impact of Foreign CurrencyExchange Rates" included above. Thes
e non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and itsprospects for the future. Spe
cifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreigncurrency exchange rat
e impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we have historically reportedcertain non-GAAP results to investors, we b
elieve that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provide consistency in our financial reporting.43

In addition to these corresponding GAAP measures, management uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing our financial results.Liquidity and Capital Resources

2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $256 million , $343 million and $466 million , respectively. Continuing Investing Activities
The net cash used in continuing inv
esting activities of $673 million in 2015 was due primarily to cash pa id for purchases of investments of $6.7 billion , purchases of property and equip
ment of $668 million and net cash paid for acquis ition of businesses of $24 million , partially offset by pro ceeds of $6.8 billion from the maturiti
es and sales of investments.The net cash used in continuing inv
esting activities of  $1.3 billion  in  2014  was due primarily to cash pa id for purchases of investments of $8.8 billion , purchases of property and equip
ment of $622 million and net cash paid for acquis ition of businesses of $55 million partially offset by pro ceeds of $8.1 billion from the maturities and sa
les of investments.The net cash used in continuing inv
esting activities of $3.6 billion in 2013 was due primarily to net c ash paid for purchases of investments of $6.9 billion , purchases of property and equip
ment of $678 million and net cash paid for acquis ition of businesses of $138 million partially offset by pro ceeds of $3.6 billion from the maturiti
es and sales of investments and $485 million from the repayment of note receivable and sale of related equity investments.The largely offsetting effects
 of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of investments results from the management of our portfolio of short termand long term investments. As our 
immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate. In the year ended December 31, 2014, a portion of theproceeds from the issuanc
e of senior notes were used to purchase investments in our short term and long term portfolios.44

Continuing Financing ActivitiesThe net cash used in continuing f
inancing activities of $3.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily to cash out flows from $2.1 billion to repurchase common stock, 
$850 million payment of debt upon maturi ty and cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $245 million related to net share settlements  of restrictedstock units and awards. These cash out
flows were partially offset by cash inflows of $221 million from the issuance of com mon stock in connection with theexercise of stock options and 
the effect of $74 million of excess tax benefits f rom stock-based compensation.The net cash used in continuing f
inancing activities of  $1.0 billion  in  2014  was due primarily to cash out flows of $4.7 billion to repurchase common stock and cash paid for tax withholdings 
in the amount of $252 million related to net share s ettlements of restricted stock units and awards. These cash outflows werepartially offset by c
ash inflows from $3.5 billion from the issuance of senio r notes,  $300 million from the issuance of com mon stock in connection with theexercise of stock options and 
the effect of $75 million of excess tax benefits f rom stock-based compensation.The net cash used in continuing f
inancing activities of $1.4 billion in 2013 was due primarily to cash out flows of $1.3 billion in cash paid to repurchase our common stock, 
$400 million payment of debt upon maturi ty and $267 million in cash paid for tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stockunits. These cash outflows were par
tially offset by cash inflows of $437 million from the issuance of com mon stock in connection with the exercise of stockoptions, and 
$112 million in excess tax benefits f rom stock based compensation.The negative effect o
f currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015 was due to the strengthening of th e U.S. dollar against othercurrencies, primar
ily the Euro. The negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during  2014  was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain 
foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Korean won. The positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalentsduring  
2013  was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Stock Repurchases
In January 2014, our Board authorized 
a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the d
ate of authorization. In January 2015, our Board authorized an additional  $2 billion  stock repurchase program, wi th no expirationfrom the date of author
ization. In June 2015, our Board authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date ofauthorization. The stock r
epurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subjectto market conditions and oth
er factors, to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under ourstock repurchase program
s may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchasetransactions) or other 
means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financingalternatives.
During 
2015 , we repurchased approximat ely  $2.1 billion  of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2015 , a total of approximately 
$1.8 billion remained availabl e for future repurchases of our common stock under our January 2015 and June 2015 repurchase programs and noamount remained avai
lable under our January 2014 repurchase program. We expect, subject to m
arket conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic repurchases of our common stock. However, our stockrepurchase programs may b
e limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a varietyof factors, including corpo
rate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of ourcash.  
Shelf Registration Statement and Long-Term Debt
At 
December 31, 2015 , we had an effective shel f registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue varioustypes of debt securities, 
as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest in shares of preferred stock, purchasecontracts and units from
 time to time in one or more offerings. Each issuance under the shelf registration statement will require the filing of a prospectussupplement identifying th
e amount and terms of the securities to be issued. The registration statement does not limit the amount of securities that may be issuedthereunder. Our ability to 
issue securities is subject to market conditions and other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings andcompliance with the cove
nants in our credit agreement.45

We previously issued senior notes in underwritten public offerings under prior registration statements. The senior notes that remained outstanding as ofDecember 31, 2015 
consisted of $450 million aggr egate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2017, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.35% fixedrate notes due 2017, $400 million 
aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2019, $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.2% fixed rate notes due2019, $500 million aggregate pr
incipal amount of 3.250% fixed rate notes due 2020, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.60% fixed rate notes due 2022,$750 million aggregate pr
incipal amount of 2.875% fixed rate notes due 2021, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% fixed rate notes due 2024 and$750 million aggregate pr
incipal amount of 4.00% fixed rate notes due 2042. The net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes were used for general corporatepurposes, including, among other th
ings, the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings.During the year ended 
December 31, 2015 , $250 million aggregate principal amount of 0.700% fixed rate notes due 2015 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 
1.625% fixed rate notes due 2015 ma tured and were repaid during the year.To help achieve our i
nterest rate risk management objectives, we previously entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4billion of the fixed ra
te notes to floating rate debt based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. These swaps were designated as fair valuehedges against changes in the 
fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates.The indenture pursuant to which th
e senior notes were issued includes customary covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit ourability to incur, assume o
r guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties, andalso includes customary ev
ents of default.Commercial Paper
In connection with entering 
into the credit agreement described below, in November 2015, the Company reduced the aggregate principal amount at maturityof commercial pape
r notes which may be outstanding under its commercial paper program at any time from $2.0 billion to $1.5 billion to correspond with the $1.5 billion 
of available borrowing  capacity it maintains under the credit agreement for the repayment of commercial paper borrowings in the event it is unable to repaythose borrowings from other sourc
es when they become due. We have a $1.5 billion commercial paper p rogram pursuant to which we may issue commercial papernotes with maturities of up 
to 397 days from the date of issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2015 
, there were no commerc ial paper notes outstanding.Credit Agreement
In November 2015, we entered into a 
credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility . We may also, subject tothe agreement of the applicable
 lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion . Funds borrowed under the credit agre
ement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The credit agreement replacedour prior $3.0 billion unsecured 
revolving credit agreement, entered into in November 2011.As of 
December 31, 2015 , no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. Howeve r, as described above, we have an up to $1.5 billion 
commercial paper program and t herefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing cap acity under our credit agreement in order to repay commercialpaper borrowings in the event we a
re unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result, at December 31, 2015 , $500million 
of borrowing capacity was avai lable for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.  Loans under the credit agr
eement bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“ LIBOR ”) plus a margin (based on our pub lic debt creditratings) ranging from 
0.875 percent to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent or LIBORplus 
1.0 percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.0 percent to 0.5 percent. The credit agreement will terminate and allamounts owing thereunder will be du
e and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event ofdefault occurs, by the lend
ers (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request,subject to the agreement of
 the lenders. The credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, includingfinancial covenants, ev
ents of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence ofliens and subsidiary indebtedn
ess, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to aminimum consolidated interest
 coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.46

We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2015 . Credit Ratings
Our credit ratings were downgrad
ed as a result of the Distribution. As of January 1, 2014, our long-term debt and short-term funding were rated investmentgrade by Standard and Poor's Financial Se
rvices, LLC (long-term rated A, short-term rated A-1, with a stable outlook), Moody's Investor Service (long-term ratedA2, short-term rated P-1, with a s
table outlook), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (long-term rated A, short-term rated F-1, with a stable outlook). All of these credit ratingagencies lowered their 
ratings in connection with the Distribution, which occurred on July 17, 2015. Since July 20, 2015, we have been rated investment grade byStandard and Poor's Financial Servic
es, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term rated A-2, with a stable outlook), Moody's Investor Service (long-term rated Baa1,short-term rated P-2, with 
a stable outlook), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (long-term rated BBB, short-term rated F-2, with a stable outlook). We disclose these ratings toenhance the understanding of ou
r sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our creditratings and any further a
ctions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as described above, will likely increase our borrowing costs.Commitments and Contingencies
We have certain fix
ed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in ourbusiness needs, c
ontractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. Wecannot provide certain
ty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments:Payments Due During the Year Ending December 31,

 $8,329  $222  $340  $8,891 The significant assumptions us
ed in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:•
Debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments. For additional details related to our debt, please see “Note11 – Debt” to the consolidated f
inancial statements included in this report. This table does not reflect any amounts payable under our $2 billionrevolving credit fac
ility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2015 . •
Lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, fulfillment centers, as well ascomputer and office equ
ipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are notexpected to differ sign
ificantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expandour occupied space or
 exit an office facility early.•
Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, softwareapplications, engineer
ing development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.As we are unable to reasonably pr
edict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $416 millionof such non-current lia
bilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 . 47

Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsAs of 
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equityinvestments, in an aggrega
te amount of $8.5 billion and $12.4 billion , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , this amount included assets h eld in certain of ourforeign operations tota
ling approximately $7.0 billion . Of the $7.0 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approxim ately $4.8 billion was available for use inthe U.S. without incurring additiona
l U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015.As of December 31, 2015, we had not repatr
iated any of these funds to the U.S. and, as a result, we have not yet paid U.S. tax on any portion of these funds. To theextent we repatriat
e this $4.8 billion of undistributed foreign earnings, we estimate, based on current tax rates, that it would increase our U.S. cash byapproximately $3.2 billion, n
et of related tax paid. The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equityinvestments, have been inde
finitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued as this amount is necessary to support ourplanned ongoing investments in our 
foreign operations. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S., andwe do not expect that we will need 
to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our planschange and we were to choose to rep
atriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested, we will be required to pay U.S. income andapplicable foreign withho
lding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs.In connection with the Distribu
tion, we reviewed our capital allocation strategy to ensure that each of PayPal and eBay would be well capitalized atDistribution. As part of this str
ategy, we contributed approximately $3.8 billion of cash to PayPal. This contribution consisted of approximately $1.8 billion ofdomestic sources and $2.0 bill
ion of international sources.We actively monitor 
all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of principal andsecondarily on improving yie
ld on these assets. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce ourexposure should any one of these count
erparties fail or encounter difficulties. To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our investedcash, cash equivalents or shor
t-term investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-terminvestments will not be imp
acted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. At any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customeraccounts that are deposi
ted and invested with third party financial institutions.We believe that our ex
isting cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated from operations,borrowings available under our 
credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our operatingactivities, anticipated capital expe
nditures and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of 
December 31, 2015 , we had no off- balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on ourconsolidated financia
l condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.We have a cash pooling arr
angement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. This arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from thefinancial institut
ion based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). This arrangementalso allows us to withdraw amounts exc
eeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the AggregateCash Deposits are used by the financ
ial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 
$2.4 billion in cash withdrawals offsett ing our $2.4 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within th e financial institution under the cash poolingarrangements.
Indemnification Provisions
We entered into a sepa
ration and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship of the twocompanies going forward. These ag
reements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal, which maybe significant. In addit
ion, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our indemnity obligations toPayPal may be significant.
48

In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we havecommercial relations, including
 our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these contracts, wegenerally indemnify, hold h
armless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claimsby a third party with respec
t to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performanceunder the subject agree
ment. In certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement. It is not possible to determine themaximum potential loss und
er these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstancesinvolved in each particu
lar provision. To date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have notbeen significant, either in
dividually or collectively.Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimat
esGeneral
The preparation of our
 consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reportedamounts of assets, liabil
ities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experienceand on various other assumptions th
at are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about thecarrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed the development, selection anddisclosure of these esti
mates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions orconditions.
An accounting policy is consider
ed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highlyuncertain at the time the estimate i
s made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that arereasonably likely to occ
ur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflectthe more significant 
estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The following descriptions of critical accountingpolicies, judgments and est
imates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other disclosures included in thisreport.
Revenue Recognition
We may enter into certain reven
ue transactions, primarily related to certain advertising contracts, that are considered multiple element arrangements(arrangements with mor
e than one deliverable). We also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and/or services from certain customers. As a result,significant interpretation and
 judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including: (1) how the arrangementconsideration should
 be allocated among potential multiple deliverables; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each deliverable; (3) whetherrevenue should be reported gross 
(as eBay is acting as a principal), or net (as eBay is acting as an agent); (4) when we provide cash consideration to our customers,determining whether we ar
e receiving an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer's purchase of our products and/or services and for which we canreasonably estimate 
fair value; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred. Changes in judgments withrespect to these assumpt
ions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.Accounting for Income Taxes
Our annual tax rate is based on ou
r income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.Tax laws are complex and subje
ct to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required indetermining our tax expens
e and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balancesas new information becomes 
available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local countrytax laws and regulations, our in
come tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment isdetermined by managem
ent's judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations. At December 31, 2015 , $6.0 billion of earnings had been indefinitely reinves
ted outside the U.S., primarily in active non-U.S. business operations. We do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund U.S. operations and,accordingly, we do not provide for U.S. fed
eral income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings.Deferred tax assets rep
resent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporarydifferences between th
e financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as49

from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of futureexpected taxable income from all
 sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.These sources of income re
ly heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-rangebusiness forecasts. At 
December 31, 2015 , we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not thatthe deferred tax asse
t will not be realized.We recognize and measu
re uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, pursuant to which weonly recognize the tax ben
efit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxingauthorities, based on the t
echnical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based onthe largest benefit that has
 a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefitsresulting from uncert
ain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expectedultimate resolution o
f uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any,related to unrecogniz
ed tax benefits in income tax expense.We file annual incom
e tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position isaudited by the relevant ta
x authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particularuncertain tax position, we be
lieve that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, whereappropriate in light of 
changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.The following table illust
rates our effective tax rates for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 :

tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates andhigher than anticipat
ed in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes orinterpretations in t
ax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the InternalRevenue Service, as well as var
ious state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations todetermine the adequa
cy of our provision for income taxes.Based on our results for the yea
r ended December 31, 2015 , a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of incomebefore taxes would have resul
ted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $24 million , resulting in an approxima te $0.02 change in diluted earnings per share.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recogni
ze stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share-based payment awards made to ouremployees and directors, 
including employee stock options, employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards, over the service period for awards expected tovest. Stock-based compensation 
expense recognized for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $379 million , $344 million and $298 million , respectively. See “Note 16 - Stock-Based and Employee Savings Plans” to 
the consolidated financial statements included in this report.50

We calculated the fair value of each restricted stock award based on our stock price on the date of grant. We calculated the fair value of each stock optionaward on the date of grant using 
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using anoption-pricing model is a
ffected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of additional variables described below. The use of a Black-Scholesmodel requires extensive act
ual employee exercise behavior data and a number of assumptions, including expected life, expected volatility, risk-free interest rateand dividend yield. As a result, fu
ture stock-based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts. The weighted-average grant-date fair value ofstock options granted during 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $6.84 , $13.59 and $15.39 per share, respective ly, using the Black-Scholes model with the followingweighted-average assumpt
ions:

4.1  4.1  4.1 Dividend yield
— % — % — %Expected volatility
27 % 29 % 34 %Our computation of expected vo
latility for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was based on a combination of histo rical and market-based implied volatility from tradedoptions on our stock. Our computation of 
expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractualterms of the stock-based 
awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of theaward was based on the U.S. Treasury yield cu
rve in effect at the time of grant. The estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to theextent actual results or u
pdated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates arerevised. We consider many 
factors when estimating forfeitures, including employee class and historical experience.Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The purchase price of an a
cquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of thepurchase price record
ed as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgmentscan include, but are not l
imited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.At 
December 31, 2015 , our goodwill totaled $4.5 billion and our identifiable intan gible assets, net totaled $90 million . We assess the impairm ent ofgoodwill of our reporting units annu
ally, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill istested for impairment at the rep
orting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of thereporting unit is less than 
its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to itsfair value. The fair v
alues of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carryingvalue of the reporting uni
t exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. The market approach uses comparablecompany information to 
determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units. Failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples maycause a future impai
rment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2015 and 2014. Additionally,we evaluated impairm
ent based on the significant activities regarding the Distribution and Enterprise divestiture during the year. See “Note 4 - DiscontinuedOperations” to the consolida
ted financial statements included in this report for further detail. As of December 31, 2015 , we determined that no fur ther impairmentof the carrying value of goodwi
ll for any reporting units was required. See “Note 5 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to the consolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.
Provision for Transaction Losses
Provision for transaction loss
es consists primarily of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud and bad debt expenseassociated with our accounts 
receivable balance. We expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to ourcustomer protection prog
rams and the impact of regulatory changes.51

The following table illustrates the provision for transaction losses as a percentage of net revenues for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 :   
Year Ended December 31,  
2015  2014  2013  
(In millions, except percentages) Net revenues
$ 8,592  $8,790  $8,257 Provision for transaction loss
es$ 271  $262  $236 Provision for transaction loss
es as a % of net revenues3.2 % 3.0 % 2.9 %Determining appropriat
e allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and is subject to numerous estimates and judgments, and ultimatelosses may vary from the cu
rrent estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact thesettlement or recov
ery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date.An aggregate 50 basis point devia
tion from our provision for transaction losses as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease inoperating income of approx
imately $43 million in 2015 , resulting in an approxima te $0.02 change in diluted earnings p er share.Legal Contingencies
In connection with certa
in pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, and provided forsuch losses through charges to our conso
lidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at eachbalance sheet date and 
are subject to change based upon new information and future events.From time to time, we ar
e involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involved in legalproceedings, some of which are d
iscussed in “Item 1A: Risk Factors,” “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and “Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies” to theconsolidated financia
l statements included in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we intend to defend ourselvesvigorously. However, even if successfu
l, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of management's time and resultin the diversion of signifi
cant operational resources. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensingfees, modify our business prac
tices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our businessand could result in a mat
erial adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See "Note 1 - The Company and Summary of Signif
icant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, regarding theimpact of certain 
recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A: 
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate Risk
We are exposed to inter
est rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and our outstanding debt. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result fromchanges in interest rates.
As of 
December 31, 2015 , approximately 19% of our total cash and invest ment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents. As such, changes in interestrates will impact in
terest income. As discussed below, fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and wemay suffer losses in 
principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.As of December 31, 2013, 100% of the outstand
ing senior notes bore interest at fixed rates. In July 2014, we issued additional senior notes in an aggregateprincipal amount of $3.5 bil
lion comprised of $850 million of floating rate notes and $2.65 billion of fixed rate notes, as described in the “Shelf RegistrationStatement and Long-Term Debt
” section of "Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" above. In order toreduce volatility th
at may result from changes in interest rates, we entered into $2.4 billion of interest rate swap agreements that have the52

economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with $1.15 billion of our 2.2% senior notes due July 2019, $750 million of our 2.875%senior notes due July 2021, and $500 mill
ion of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024 so that the interest payable on those notes effectively became variablebased on LIBOR plus a spread. Further changes in 
interest rates will impact interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which bearinterest at float
ing rates, and the interest rate on any commercial paper borrowings we make and any debt securities we may issue in the future and, accordingly,will impact interest expense.
As of 
December 31, 2015 , we held no direct  investments in auction rate securities, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles ormortgage-backed securities.
 
Investments in both fi
xed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may 
be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greaterinterest-rate risk than those
 with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest-rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce le
ss income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in partto these factors, our inves
tment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market valuedue to changes in interest 
rates. As of December 31, 2015 , the balance of our governm ent bond and corporate debt security portfolio was $6.6 billion , which represented approximately 
69% of our total cash and invest ment portfolio. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impacton our financial assets or 
liabilities as of December 31, 2015 . Investment Risk
The primary objective of 
our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk. Toachieve this objectiv
e, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of asset types, including bank deposits,government bonds and corporate d
ebt securities.As of 
December 31, 2015 , our cost and equity method inves tments totaled $124 million , which represented approxim ately 1% of our total cash andinvestment portfolio, and we
re primarily related to equity method investments in privately held companies. We review our investments for impairment whenevents and circumstanc
es indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recentoperating results and tr
ends, recent sales/acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data.Equity Price Risk
We are exposed to equity pr
ice risk on marketable equity instruments due to market volatility. As of December 31, 2015 , the total fair valu e of ourmarketable equity ins
truments (primarily related to our equity holdings in MercadoLibre) was $929 million , which represented approxim ately 10% of our total cash and investment portfo
lio.Foreign Currency Risk
Our commerce platforms operate
 globally, resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Britishpound, Korean won and Australian dollar, subj
ecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in variousforeign currencies and h
ave significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectualproperty and technology and for 
certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow, results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that areexposed to foreign e
xchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currencyfluctuations and rela
ted hedging activities.We have a foreign exchang
e exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures and reducethe potential effe
cts of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the purchase of foreign currency exchangecontracts. The effec
tiveness of the program and the resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts is at times limited by our ability to achieve cash flowhedge accounting. T
hese foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our derivativeinstruments, please see 
“Note 9 – Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.We use foreign exchange de
rivative contracts and invest non-U.S. cash in U.S. denominated investments to ultimately protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings fro
m adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging53

contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. Most of these contracts are designated as cash flowhedges for accounting purposes. For qua
lifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component ofaccumulated other co
mprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Theineffective portion o
f the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flowhedges for accounting purposes, th
e derivative's gain or loss is recognized immediately in interest and other, net, in our consolidated statement of income.However, only certain revenue 
and costs are eligible for cash flow hedge accounting. Subsequent to the Distribution, fewer of our currency flows meet the U.S.GAAP criteria for cash flow hedge a
ccounting. While, economically, we face the same currency risks, our statement of income is more subject to volatility due tocurrency fluctuations.
We considered the histor
ical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for allcurrencies could be experie
nced in the near term. If the relevant functional currencies weakened by 20% at December 31, 2015 , the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign 
exchange derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges, before tax effect, would have been approximately $45 million higher. If therelevant functional currencies 
strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2015 , the amount recorded in AOCI rel ated to our foreign exchange derivative contractsqualifying as cash flow hedges, be
fore tax effect, would have been approximately $27 million lower.In addition, we use foreign exch
ange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than thefunctional currency of ou
r subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets andliabilities. The for
eign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other, net, which are offset by the gains and losses on theforeign exchange contracts.
We considered the histor
ical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of20% for all currenci
es could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes ofapproximately $27 mill
ion at December 31, 2015 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange forwards in place as of December 31, 2015 . 54

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Shareho
lders of eBay Inc.:In our opinion, the consolidated 
financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positionof eBay Inc. and its subsidiari
es at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years inthe period ended December 31, 2015 
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, thefinancial statement schedule liste
d in the index   appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when readin conjunction with the rel
ated consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal controlover financial repor
ting as of December 31, 2015 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statementschedule, for maintaining
 effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,included in Management's Repor
t on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on thesefinancial statem
ents, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. Weconducted our audits in acco
rdance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we planand perform the audits t
o obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidencesupporting the amounts and disclosu
res in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, andevaluating the overal
l financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal controlover financial repor
ting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controlbased on the assessed risk. Our audits 
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our auditsprovide a reasonable basis 
for our opinions.As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidat
ed financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred tax assets and liabilities on theconsolidated balance she
et in 2015.A company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financialstatements in accord
ance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management
 and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition o
f the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 – The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
eBay Inc. is a global comme
rce leader, including our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Our Marketplace platforms include our onlinemarketplace loca
ted at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. Our StubHub platforms include our online ticket platform located atwww.stubhub.com and the StubHub mobile apps. Our Classifieds p
latforms include a collection of brands such as Mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBayClassifieds and others. 
On July 17, 2015, we completed the distribu
tion of 100% of the outstanding common stock o f PayPal Holdings, Inc. ("PayPal") to our stockholders (the"Distribution"), pursuant to which PayPal b
ecame an independent company. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, PayPal's financial results for periods prior tothe Distribution have been r
eflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operations. Additionally, the related assets andliabilities associ
ated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet are classified as discontinued operations. Pursuant to the terms ofthe separation and distr
ibution agreement entered into between us and PayPal on June 26, 2015, upon Distribution, assets related to the PayPal business weretransferred to, and li
abilities related to the PayPal business were retained or assumed by, PayPal. See "Note 4 - Discontinued Operations" for additionalinformation.
During the second quarter of 2015, our Boa
rd of Directors ("Board") approved a plan to sell the businesses underlying our former Enterprise segment("Enterprise"). As a result, 
the Enterprise financial results were reflected in our consolidated statement of income, retrospectively, as discontinued operationsbeginning in the second quarte
r of 2015. On July 16, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Enterprise and on November 2, 2015, the sale closed. As aresult, the related 
assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the prior year consolidated balance sheet are classified as discontinuedoperations. See "Note 4 - Discontinued Ope
rations" for additional information.When we refer to “we,” “our,
” “us” or “eBay” in this document, we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its California predecessor, aswell as all of our consolida
ted subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.Use of estimates
The preparation of consolid
ated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management tomake estimates and assumpti
ons that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of theconsolidated financia
l statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,including those related 
to provisions for transaction losses, legal contingencies, income taxes, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, goodwill and therecoverability of in
tangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under thecircumstances. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.Principles of consolidation and basis of presentat
ionThe accompanying financi
al statements are consolidated and include the financial statements of eBay Inc., our wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries andvariable interest entities (“VIE”)
 where we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Minority interests ar
e recorded as a noncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidation requirement for VIEs. Investments inentities where we hold at l
east a 20% ownership interest and have th e ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted forusing the equity method of ac
counting. For such investments, our share of the investees' results of operations is included in interest and other, net and ourinvestment balance is 
included in long-term investments. Investments in entities where we hold less than a 20% ownership interest are gen erally accounted forusing the cost method of accoun
ting, and our share of the investees' results of operations is included in our consolidated statement of income to the extentdividends are received.
We have evaluated al
l subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.F-7

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)Revenue recognition
We generate net transaction reve
nues primarily from final value fees and listing fees paid by sellers. Final value fee revenues are recognized at the time thatthe transaction is succ
essfully closed, while listing fee revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated period of the listing. An auction transaction is consideredsuccessfully closed when at l
east one buyer has bid above the seller's specified minimum price or reserve price, whichever is higher, at the end of the transactionterm.
Our marketing services re
venues are derived principally from the sale of advertisements, revenue sharing arrangements, classifieds fees, marketing servicefees and lead refer
ral fees. Our advertising revenues are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements. The duration of our advertising contracts hasranged from one week to 
five years, but is generally one week to one year. Advertising revenues on contracts are recognized as “impressions” (i.e., the number oftimes that an advert
isement appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) are delivered, or as “clicks” (which are generated each time users on our platformsclick through our advertis
ements to an advertiser's designated website) are provided to advertisers. For contracts with minimum monthly or quarterly advertisingcommitments where the fee an
d commitments are fixed throughout the term, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the agreement. We also may enter intoarrangements to purchase 
services from certain customers and if the service is not considered an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer's purchaseof our services or for which we c
annot reasonably estimate fair value, the fees paid to the customer is recorded as a reduction in revenue. Some of our advertisingcontracts consist of mul
tiple elements which generally include a blend of various impressions and clicks as well as other marketing deliverables. Where neithervendor-specific objec
tive evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price exists, we use management's best estimate of selling price (BESP) to allocatearrangement consider
ation on a relative basis to each element. BESP is generally based on the selling prices of the various elements when they are sold tocustomers of a simila
r nature and geography on a stand-alone basis or estimated stand-alone pricing when the element has not previously been sold on a stand-alone basis. These e
stimates are generally based on pricing strategies, market factors and strategic objectives. Revenues related to revenue sharing arrangementsare recognized based on r
evenue reports received from our partners, provided that collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues related to fees for listing items onour Classifieds platform
s are recognized over the estimated period of the classified listing. Lead referral fee revenue is generated from lead referral fees based onthe number of times users 
click through to a merchant's website from our platforms. Lead referral fees are recognized in the period in which a user clicks throughto the merchant's website.
Our other revenues are der
ived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide services to our users. Revenues from contractualarrangements with third 
parties are recognized as the contracted services are delivered to end users.To drive traffic to our p
latforms, we provide incentives to our users in the form of coupons and buyer and seller rewards. These incentives are generallytreated as reductions 
in revenue.Internal use software and platform development 
costsDirect costs incurred to
 develop software for internal use and platform development costs are capitalized and amortized over an estimated useful life of one to 
five years. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we capitalized costs, pr imarily related to labor and stock-based compensation, of $136 million and 
$144 million , respectively. Amortiz ation of previously capitalized amounts was $110 million , $115 million and $103 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Costs rela
ted to the design or maintenance of internal use software and platform development are expensed as incurred.Advertising expense
We expense the costs of produc
ing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in the period duringwhich the advertising space o
r airtime is used, in each case as sales and marketing expense. Internet advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of theindividual agreements, whi
ch are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, ona pay-per-click basis, o
r on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising expense totaled $1.0 billion , $1.0 billion and $844 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. F-8

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)Stock-based compensation
We have equity incentiv
e plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stockunits, and performance sha
re units, to our directors, officers and employees. We primarily issue restricted stock units. We determine compensation expenseassociated with restri
cted stock units based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense associated with stockoptions based on the estimat
ed grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using astraight-line amortization method
 over the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensationexpense for 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 has been reduced for e stimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well astrends of actual option
 forfeitures. We recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity to the extent that an incremental tax benefit is realized byfollowing the ordering provisions o
f the tax law. In addition, we account for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and theforeign tax credit th
rough our consolidated statement of income.Provision for transaction losses
Provision for transaction loss
es consists primarily of losses resulting from our customer protection programs, fraud and bad debt expense associated withour accounts receivable bala
nce. Provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses based on our historical experience and many other factorsincluding changes to our custom
er protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes as well as economic conditions.Income taxes
We account for income 
taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year anddeferred tax liabi
lities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The measurement ofcurrent and deferred 
tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Ifnecessary, the measure
ment of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence.We report a liability for unrec
ognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interestand penalties, if any, re
lated to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are sho
rt-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are mainlycomprised of bank deposits, ce
rtificates of deposit and commercial paper.Allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits
We record our allowance 
for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors. We consider historical experience, the age of the accountsreceivable balanc
es, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect our customers' ability to pay. The allowance for doubtful accounts andauthorized credits was 
$84 million and $86 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Investments
Short-term investments, whi
ch may include marketable equity securities, time deposits, certificates of deposit, government bonds and corporate debtsecurities with original mat
urities of greater than three months but less than one year when purchased, are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fairvalue using the specific 
identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensiveincome (loss), net of re
lated estimated tax provisions or benefits.Long-term investments m
ay include marketable government bonds and corporate debt securities, time deposits, certificates of deposit and cost and equitymethod investments. 
Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains andlosses on our available-fo
r-sale investments are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of relatedestimated tax provisions o
r benefits.F-9

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)Certain time deposits are cla
ssified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost. Our equity method investments are primarily investments in privatelyheld companies. Our consolidat
ed results of operations include, as a component of interest and other, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity methodinvestments. Our share of inves
tees' results of operations is not significant for any period presented. Our cost method investments consist of investments inprivately held compani
es and are recorded at cost. Amounts received from our cost method investees were not material to any period presented.We assess whether an other-
than-temporary impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. Withrespect to our debt secur
ities, this assessment takes into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, our intent to sell the security, whether it is morelikely than not that we will b
e required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized costbasis of the security (th
at is, whether a credit loss exists).Property and equipment
Property and equipment are s
tated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over theestimated useful liv
es of the assets, generally, one to three years for computer equip ment and software, up to thirty  years for buildings and building improvements,the shorter of 
five years or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements and three years for furniture, f ixtures and vehicles. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill is tested for impai
rment at a minimum on an annual basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessmentcan be performed to det
ermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does notpass the qualitative ass
essment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated usingincome and market appro
aches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow method,a form of the income app
roach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. The market approach uses comparable companyprices and other relevant i
nformation generated by market transactions (either publicly traded entities or merger and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to beapplied to historical 
and expected future operating results of our reporting units. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate or marketpricing metrics may 
cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2015 and2014. Additionally, we evaluated i
mpairment based on the significant activities regarding the Distribution and Enterprise divestiture during the year. See “Note 4 -Discontinued Operations” for fu
rther detail. As a result of this test, we determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any reportingunits was required. 
Intangible assets consist o
f purchased customer lists and user base, marketing related, developed technologies and other intangible assets, including patentsand contractual agreements. I
ntangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives rangingfrom 
one to eight years. No significant residu al value is estimated for intangible assets.Impairment of long-lived assets
We evaluate long-lived asset
s (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount ofa long-lived asset may not b
e recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset isexpected to generate. In 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 , no impairment was noted. Foreign currency
 
Most of our foreign
 subsidiaries use the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated atexchange rates prevai
ling at the balance sheet dates. Revenues, costs and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using daily exchange rates if the transaction isrecorded in our accounting sys
tems on a daily basis, and otherwise using average exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation ofour consolidated balance
 sheet are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.F-10

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)Gains and losses from foreign cu
rrency transactions are recognized as interest and other, net.Derivative instruments
We use derivative fin
ancial instruments, primarily forwards and swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. We may also use otherderivative instrumen
ts not designated as hedges, such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. We do not use derivative financialinstruments for trading pu
rposes. See “Note 9 - Derivative Instruments” for a full description of our derivative instrument activities and related accounting policies.Concentration of credit risk
Our cash, cash equivalents, ac
counts receivable and derivative instruments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalentsare placed with financial in
stitutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers.In each of the years ended 
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , no customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues. Our derivative instruments expose us tocredit risk to the extent t
hat our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to 
reporting discontinued operations. This new standard raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as adiscontinued operation and r
equires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinuedoperation. The new standard is now ef
fective. The standard impacted the presentation of Enterprise during the second quarter of 2015 and PayPal during the thirdquarter of 2015 related 
to the financial statement presentation of assets held for sale and discontinued operations and required additional disclosures as presented in"Note 4 - Discontinued Operations."
In 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance re
lated to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current GAAP guidance on this topicand eliminate all 
industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.The core principle is th
at a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects theconsideration for which the 
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance can be applied either retrospectively to each periodpresented or as a cumula
tive-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In 2015, the FASB issued guidance to defer the effective date to fiscal years beginningafter December 15, 2017 with e
arly adoption for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accountingguidance on our consolidated f
inancial statements.In 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to 
consolidations. The new standard amends the guidelines for determining whether certain legal entitiesshould be consolidated and reduc
es the number of consolidation models. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscalyears, beginning after Dec
ember 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on ourconsolidated financia
l statements. In 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to p
resentation of debt issuance costs. The new standard requires that debt issuance costs related to arecognized debt liabi
lity be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new standard is effective forfiscal years, and inte
rim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is notexpected to have a material impact
 on our consolidated financial statements. In 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to 
accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The new standard provides guidance tocustomers about whether a c
loud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then thecustomer should account for 
the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computingarrangement does not inc
lude a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new standard is effective for fiscalyears, and interim per
iods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact, if any, ofadopting this new accounting guidan
ce on our consolidated financial statements.In 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to bus
iness combinations. The new guidance requires that adjustments made to provisional amountsrecognized in a business comb
ination be recorded in the period such adjustments are determined,F-11

r share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstandingduring the period. Diluted net 
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares ofcommon stock and potential
ly dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and equity incentive awards isreflected in dilut
ed net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. The 
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated:

December 31, 2015 , investment securiti es in a continuous loss position for greater than 12 months had an estimated fair value and unrealized loss of$769 million 
and $40 million respectively. We had no m aterial long-term or short-term investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position formore than 12 months as of Decemb
er 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015 , these securities had a  weighted average remaining duration of approximately 12 months. Refer to "Note 19 - Accumula
ted Other Comprehensive Income" for amounts reclassified to earnings from unrealized gains and losses. 
Our fixed-income investm
ent portfolio consists of predominantly investment grade corporate debt securities and government and agency securities that havea maximum maturity of 
8 years. The corporate debt and government and agency securities that we invest in are generally deemed to be low risk based on theircredit ratings from 
the major rating agencies. The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bondyields. As interest rates 
increase, those securities purchased at a lower yield show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. The unrealized losses are due primarily tochanges in credit spread
s and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitative and quantitativecriteria. We pres
ently do not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position and expect to realize the full value of all these investments uponmaturity or sale. Restricted
 cash is held primarily in interest bearing accounts for letters of credit related primarily to our global sabbatical program and variouslease arrangements.

method investments of approximately $124 million and $184 million included in long-term inv estments on ourconsolidated balance she
et at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Our derivative instrumen
ts vary in duration depending on contract type. Our foreign exchange derivative contracts are primarily short-term in nature,generally 
one month to one year in duration. Certain foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges may have a duration of up to 18 months. Theduration of our interest 
rate derivative contracts match the duration of the fixed rate notes due 2019, 2021 and 2024.As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we held no direct  investments in auction rate securities, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehiclesor mortgage-backed securities.
Other financial instruments
, including accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term nature of these 
instruments.F-23

NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)Note 9 – Derivative Instruments
Summary of Derivative Instruments
Our primary objective in ho
lding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchangerates and interest r
ates. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek tomitigate such risk by li
miting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any onecounterparty resulting 
from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. To further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangementsrelated to certain interest rate derivati
ve instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if the fair value of the derivative instrument exceedscertain thresholds. Addition
al collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit downgrade by either party.Foreign Exchange Contracts
We transact business in va
rious foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies, whichsubjects us to foreign curr
ency risk. We use foreign currency exchange contracts, primarily short-term in nature, generally one month to one year in duration butwith maturities up to 18 months, 
to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated inforeign currencies. The ob
jective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adverselyaffected by changes in th
e applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. For derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effectiveportion of the derivativ
e’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified intoearnings in the same per
iod the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, isrecorded immediat
ely in earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign exchange contracts on a quarterly basis. We do not use any foreign exchangecontracts for trading pu
rposes.For our derivative instrum
ents designated as cash flow hedges, the amounts recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion were not material ineach of the periods presen
ted, and we did not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedgeeffectiveness. As of 
December 31, 2015 , we have estimated that approximately $33 million of net derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included inaccumulated other co
mprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.Interest Rate Contracts
In connection with the July 2014 issuan
ce of our fixed rate notes due 2019, 2021 and 2024, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that havethe economic effect of modifyi
ng the fixed interest obligations associated with $2.4 billion of these notes so that the in terest payable on these senior noteseffectively beca
me variable based on London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. We have designated these swap agreements as qualifying hedginginstruments and are ac
counting for them as fair value hedges. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes becausethey protect us against ch
anges in the fair value of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. Changes in the fair values ofthese interest rat
e swap agreements are recognized in other assets or other liabilities with a corresponding increase or decrease in long-term debt. Each quarter wepay interest based on LIBOR plus a spread 
to the counterparty and on a semi-annual basis receive interest from the counterparty per the fixed rate of these seniornotes. The net amount is recogn
ized as interest expense in interest and other, net. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, ifany, is recorded immedi
ately in earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our contracts on a quarterly basis. We do not use any interest rate swap agreements fortrading purposes.
For our derivative in
struments designated as fair value hedges, the amounts recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion were not material ineach of the periods presen
ted, and we did not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedgeeffectiveness.

1.625% fixed rate notes due 2015 ma tured and were repaid during the year.The floating rate notes are
 not redeemable prior to maturity. We may redeem some or all of the fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time totime prior to their maturity, 
generally at a make-whole redemption price.To help achieve our inter
est rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we entered into interest rateswap agreements that ef
fectively converted $2.4 billion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt based on LIBOR plus a spread. These swaps were designated asfair value hedges agains
t changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The gains and losses related to changesin the fair value of in
terest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes inmarket interest rates.
The effective inte
rest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of any original issuediscount on these senior notes. In
terest on these senior notes is payable either quarterly or semiannually. Interest expense associated with these senior notes,including amortizat
ion of debt issuance costs, during theF-28

years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $178 million and $137 million , respectively. At December 31, 2015 , the estimated fair value of these senior notes was approxim
ately $6.5 billion . The indenture pursuant to which th
e senior notes were issued includes customary covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit ourability to incur, assume o
r guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties, andalso includes customary ev
ents of default.Commercial Paper
In connection with entering 
into the credit agreement described below, in November 2015, the Company reduced the aggregate principal amount at maturityof commercial paper notes 
which may be outstanding under its commercial paper program at any time from $2.0 billion to $1.5 billion to correspond with the $1.5 billion 
of available borrowing  capacity it maintains under the credit agreement for the repayment of commercial paper borrowings in the event it is unable to repaythose borrowings from other sourc
es when they become due. We have a $1.5 billion commercial paper p rogram pursuant to which we may issue commercial papernotes with maturities of up 
to 397 days from the date of issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2015 
, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.Credit Agreement
In November 2015, we entered into a 
credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five -year revolving credit facility. We may also, subject tothe agreement of the applicable
 lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion . Funds borrowed under the credit agre
ement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The credit agreement replacedour prior 
$3.0 billion unsecured revolving credi t agreement, dated as of November 2011.As of 
December 31, 2015 , no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. Howeve r, as described above, we have an up to $1.5 billion 
commercial paper program and t herefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing cap acity under our credit agreement in order to repay commercialpaper borrowings in the event we a
re unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result, at December 31, 2015 , $500million 
of borrowing capacity was avai lable for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.  Loans under the credit agr
eement bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“ LIBOR ”) plus a margin (based on our pub lic debt creditratings) ranging from 
0.875 percent to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent or LIBORplus 
1.0 percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.0 percent to 0.5 percent. The credit agreement will terminate and allamounts owing thereunder will be du
e and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event ofdefault occurs, by the lend
ers (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request,subject to the agreement of
 the lenders. The credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, includingfinancial covenants, ev
ents of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence ofliens and subsidiary indebtedn
ess, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to aminimum consolidated interest
 coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.We were in compliance wi

Overview
We are involved in lega
l and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminateamount of damages. If we bel
ieve that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in ourfinancial statem
ents. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likelyoutcome; if none of the es
timates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in whichan unfavorable outcome is 
reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we haveconcluded that an estim
ate of the reasonably possible loss or range arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment orsettlement) are no
t material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed thatfact. In assessing the
 materiality of a proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact ofnon-monetary remedies sough
t by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a materialadverse impact on our business. 
With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that couldpotentially result f
rom the application of such non-monetary remedies.Amounts accrued for legal 
and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 
. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently available information, that reasonablypossible losses arising dire
ctly from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are alsonot material. However, leg
al and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolvedagainst us in a reporting pe
riod for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial condition for that reportingperiod could be material.

Regulatory Proceedings
In May 2014, we publicly announced that 
criminals were able to penetrate our network and steal certain data, including user names, encrypted userpasswords and other non-financia
l user data. Upon making this announcement, we required all buyers and sellers on our platform to reset their passwords in orderto login to their account. 
In addition to making this public announcement, we proactively approached a number of regulatory and governmental bodies, includingthose with the most direct sup
ervisory authority over our data privacy and data security programs, to specifically inform them of the incident and our actions toprotect our customers in 
response. Certain of those regulatory agencies have requested us to provide further, more detailed information regarding the incident, andwe believe that we have ful
ly cooperated in all of those requests. To date, we have not been informed by any regulatory authority of an intention to bring anyenforcement action 
arising from this incident; however, in the future we may be subject to fines or other regulatory action.  In addition, in July 2014, a putativeclass action lawsuit was fi
led against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the incident. The lawsuit was recently dismissed with leave to amend.General Matters
Other third parties have
 from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We aresubject to patent disputes, 
and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as ourproducts and services continu
e to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against ourcustomers (who may be entit
led to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a result ofour acquisitions and divesti
tures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may alsobecome more vulnerabl
e to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act areinterpreted by the cour
ts, and as we expand the scope of our business (both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographicaloperations) and become subj
ect to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves areeither unclear or l
ess favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us.Intellectual prope
rty claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods ofdoing business or could require us to 
enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms.From time to time, we ar
e involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our users(individually or as class 
actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices, rules, policies orcustomer/user agreements violate
 applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies or agreements.Further, the number and signif
icance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in termsof the range of products and se
rvices that we offer and our geographical operations) and our products andF-31

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)services have increas
ed in complexity. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation,damage awards (including st
atutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business throughadverse judgment or sett
lement, require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in thediversion of significant op
erational resources or otherwise harm our business.Indemnification Provisions
We entered into a sepa
ration and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship of the twocompanies going forward. These ag
reements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal, which maybe significant. In addit
ion, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our indemnity obligations toPayPal may be significant.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we havecommercial relations, including
 our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these contracts, wegenerally indemnify, hold h
armless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claimsby a third party with respec
t to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performanceunder the subject agree
ment. In certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement. It is not possible to determine themaximum potential loss und
er these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstancesinvolved in each particu
lar provision. To date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have notbeen significant, either in
dividually or collectively. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of 
December 31, 2015 , we had no off- balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on ourconsolidated financia
l condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.We have a cash pooling arr
angement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. This arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from thefinancial institut
ion based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). This arrangementalso allows us to withdraw amounts exc
eeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the AggregateCash Deposits are used by the financ
ial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 
$2.4 billion in cash withdrawals offsett ing our $2.4 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within th e same financial institution under the cashpooling arrangement.

Note 15 – Stock Repurchase ProgramIn January 2014, our Board authorized 
a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the d
ate of authorization. In January 2015, our Board authorized an additional  $2 billion  stock repurchase program, wi th no expirationfrom the date of author
ization. In June 2015, our Board authorized an additional  $1 billion  stock repurchase program, wi th no expiration from the date ofauthorization. The stock r
epurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subjectto market conditions and oth
er factors, to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases underour stock repurchase progra
ms may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated sharerepurchase transact
ions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or otherfinancing alternatives.
Our stock repurchase programs 
may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased willdepend on a variety of fac
tors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management's determination as to theappropriate use of our cash.

en retired.Note 16 – Stock-Based and Employee Savings Plans
Equity Incentive Plans
 
We have equity incentiv
e plans under which we grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stockunits, and performance sha
re units, to our directors, officers and employees. At December 31, 2015 , 740 million shares were authorized unde r our equity incentiveplans and 
65 million shares were available for future grant, these awards were modified as described below.All stock options granted under th
ese plans generally vest 12.5% six months from the date of grant (or 25% one year from the date o f grant for grants to newemployees) with the remain
der vesting at a rate of 2.08%  per month thereafte r, and generally expire seven to ten  years from the date of grant. The cost of stockoptions is determined using th
e Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of grant.Restricted stock units ar
e granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans. In general, restricted stock units vest in equal annual installmentsover a period of 
three to five years, are subject to the employees' continuing service to us and do not have an expiration date. The cost of restricted stock units isdetermined using the fa
ir value of our common stock on the date of grant.F-33

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)In 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 , certain executives were eli gible to receive performance-based restricted stock units. The number of restricted stock unitsultimately received depends 
on our business performance against specified performance targets set by the Compensation Committee. If the performance criteria aresatisfied, the perfor
mance-based restricted stock units are granted, with one-half of the grant vesting in March following the end of the performance period and theremaining one-half ves
ting one year later.Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an Employee Stock Purchas
e Plan ("ESPP") for all eligible employees. Under the plan, shares of our common stock may be purchased over anoffering period with a max
imum duration of two years at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the applicable offering period or on the lastday of the six-month purchase p
eriod. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their eligible co mpensation during an offering period.During the years ended 
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , employees purchased approxi mately 4 million , 4 million and 4 million shares under this plan at av erage prices of$30.83 
, $42.06 and $35.51 per share, respective ly. At December 31, 2015 , approximately 24 million shares of common stock were r eserved for future issuance.These awards were modified as d
escribed below.Employee Savings Plan
We have a savings plan, which qual
ifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, bu
t not more than statutory limits. In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we contributed one dollar fo r each dollar a participant contributed, with amaximum contribution of 
4% of each employee's eligible compensation, subject to a maximum employer contribution of $10,600 , $10,400 and $10,200 per employee for each per
iod, respectively. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by various other savings plans. Our total expenses for these savings plans were $51 million 
in 2015 , $43 million in 2014 and $39 million in 2013 . Deferred Stock Units
Beginning with the 2011 annual meet
ing of stockholders, we have granted deferred stock units to each non-employee director (other than Mr. Omidyar) atthe time of our annual m
eeting of stockholders equal to the result of dividing $220,000 by the fair market va lue of our common stock on the date of grant. Inaddition, prior to January 1, 2015, new di
rectors who are not employees of the company or its subsidiaries or affiliates received a one-time grant of deferred stockunits equal to the result o
f dividing $150,000 by the fair market va lue of our common stock on the date of grant. Each deferred stock unit constitutes an unfundedand unsecured right to rec
eive one share of our common stock (or, with respect to deferred stock units granted prior to August 1, 2013, the equivalent value thereofin cash or property at our e
lection). Each deferred stock unit award granted to a new non-employee director upon election to the Board vests 25% one year from the date of grant, and at a r
ate of 2.08%  per month thereafter. If the  services of the director are terminated at any time, all rights to the unvested deferred stock unitswill also terminate. In ad
dition, directors may elect to receive, in lieu of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time these fees would otherwise bepayable (i.e., on a quarte
rly basis in arrears for services provided), fully vested deferred stock units with an initial value equal to the amount based on the fairmarket value of common s
tock at the date of grant. Following the termination of a non-employee director's service on the Board of Directors, deferred stock unitsgranted prior to August 1, 2013 are pay
able in stock or cash (at our election), while deferred stock units granted on or after August 1, 2013 are payable solely instock. As of 
December 31, 2015 , there were approximately 255,579 deferred stock units outst anding included in our restricted stock unit activity below. Theseawards were modified as desc
ribed below.Modifications of Share-Based Awards
During 2015, in connection with the Distr
ibution, restricted and deferred stock awards and employee stock option awards were modified and converted intonew equity awards using conversion ra
tios designed to preserve the value of these awards to the holders immediately prior to the Distribution. On July 17, 2015,employees holding stock options, r
estricted stock awards or units, deferred stock awards, and ESPP awards denominated in pre-Distribution eBay stock received anumber of otherwise-simi
lar awards in post-Distribution eBay stock and/or PayPal stock based on the conversion ratios outlined for each group of employees in theEmployee Matters Agreem
ent that we entered into in connection with the Distribution. Adjustments to our outstanding stock based compensation awards,including ESPP awards, resulted in addit
ional compensation expense of approximately  $68 million  to be recognized over the remaining vesting life of theunderlying awards.
In December 2014, the terms o
f various stock-based awards held by the Company’s CEO, CFO, General Counsel, SVP of Human Resources and SVP ofCorporate Communications (th
e “Departing Executives”) were modified in anticipation of andF-34

lted in additional compensation expense of approximately $37 million recognized from the mod ification date in December 2014 throughthe Distribution on July 17, 2015.

December 31, 2015 , there was approximately $544 million of unearned stock-based comp ensation that will be expensed from 2016 through 2019. Ifthere are any modifications 
or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel all or a portion of theremaining unearned stock

December 31, 2015 , our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $29 million , $64million 
and $116 million , respectively. The fede ral and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the InternalRevenue Code and applicable sta
te tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will both begin to expire in 2018. Thecarryforward periods on our fo
reign net operating loss carryforwards are as follows: $38 million do not expire and $78 million are subject to valuat ion allowanceand begin to expire in 2017. As of 
December 31, 2015 , state tax credit c arryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $58 million . Most of the state tax credits carry fo
rward indefinitely.As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 , our federal capita l loss carryover amounted to $336 million and $45 million , respectively. The incr ease in the capitalloss carryover of 
$291 million is due to the sale of Enterp rise in 2015 and will expire in 2021. The remaining capital loss carryover of $45 million will expire in 2018.
At 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we maintained a valuat ion allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to operatinglosses in certain stat
es and various non-U.S. jurisdictions that we believe are not likely to be realized.During the first quarter o
f 2014, we altered our capital allocation strategy. As a result, we provided for U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxeson 
$9.0 billion of undistributed foreign e arnings for 2013 and prior years, and recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $3.0 billion . This deferred tax liability included PayPal 
related balances presented in discontinued operations as of December 31, 2014. Based on December 31, 2014 foreign exchange rates andexcluding PayPal balances, the d
eferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings amounted to $2.1 billion and was included in accrued exp enses and othercurrent liabilit
ies on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. The deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and was included in de
ferred and other tax liabilities, net due to the adoption of FASB guidance discussed in "Note 1 - The Company andSummary of Significant Account

al or foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes on $6.0 billion of our non-U.S. subsidiaries' undistribut edearnings as of 
December 31, 2015 . We intend to indefinit ely reinvest the $6.0 billion of our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistribu ted earnings in our internationaloperations. Accordingly, we curr
ently have no plans to repatriate those funds. As such, we do not know the time or manner in which we would repatriate thosefunds. Because the time or m
anner of repatriation is uncertain, we cannot determine the impact of local taxes, withholding taxes and foreign tax creditsF-38

eBay Inc.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)associated with the futur
e repatriation of such earnings and therefore cannot quantify the tax liability. In cases where we intend to repatriate a portion of our foreignsubsidiaries’ undistribut
ed earnings, we provide U.S. and applicable foreign taxes on such earnings and such taxes are included in our deferred taxes or tax payableliabilities depending upon 
the planned timing and manner of such repatriation.On a regular basis, we develop cash 
forecasts to estimate our cash needs internationally and domestically. We consider projected cash needs for, amongother things, investments in ou
r existing businesses, potential acquisitions and capital transactions, including repurchases of our common stock and debtrepayments. We estim
ate the amount of cash available or needed in the jurisdictions where these investments are expected, as well as our ability to generate cash inthose jurisdictions and our a
ccess to capital markets. This analysis enables us to conclude whether or not we will indefinitely reinvest the current period’s foreignearnings.
We benefit from tax 
rulings concluded in several different jurisdictions, most significantly Switzerland and Luxembourg. These rulings provide forsignificantly lower ra
tes of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment in those jurisdictions. These rulingsresulted in a tax savings of 
$319 million and $339 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, which incr eased earnings per share (diluted) by approximately $0.26 and 
$0.27 in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. These tax rulings are currently in effect and expire over periods ranging from 2017 to the duration of businessoperations in the respecti
ve jurisdictions. We evaluate compliance with our tax ruling agreements annually.

ax benefits of $440 million as of December 31, 2015 is $151 million of unrecognized tax benef its indemnified by PayPal. If theremaining balance of un
recognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $372 million . Of this amount, approximate ly$140 million 
of unrecognized tax benef it is indemnified by PayPal and a corresponding receivable would be reduced upon a future realization. As of December 31, 2015 
, our liabilities for unrec ognized tax benefits were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred and other tax liabilities, net.We recognize interest and/or 
penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. In 2015 , $2 million was included in tax expense for interestand penalties. The amount of 
interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $61 million and $55 million , respectively.  
We are subject to both di
rect and indirect taxation in the U.S. and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are under examination by certain taxauthorities for the 2003 to 2012 
tax years. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these or otherexaminations. The mate
rial jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for tax years after 2002 include, among others, the U.S.(Federal and California
), Germany, Korea, Israel, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Canada. 
Although the timing of the reso
lution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized taxbenefits could signific
antly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters beingexamined, we are unable to 
estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.
