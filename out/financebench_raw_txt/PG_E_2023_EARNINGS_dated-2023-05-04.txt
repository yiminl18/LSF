PG&E Corporation Reports First-Quarter Results; On Track to Deliver Solid 2023

compared to earnings  of $0.22  per diluted share for the same period in 2022 .
•Non-GAAP core earnings  were $0.29  per diluted share for the first quarter of 2023 , 
compared to earnings of $0.30  per diluted share for the same period in 2022 .
•2023 EPS guidance updated for GAAP earnings in the range of $1.00  to $1.13  per 
share.

OAKLAND  — PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) recorded first-quarter 2023  income available for  
common shareholders of $569 million , or $0.27  per diluted share, as reported in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This compares with income available for  
common shareholders of $475 million , or $0.22  per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2022 .
The increase in GAAP results was primarily driven by lower costs related to investigation 
remedies, prior period net regulatory impact, PG&E Corporation’s and Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company’s (Utility) reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
(Chapter 11), and higher Fire Victim Trust tax benefit net of securitization.
“The team at PG&E is driving forward in reducing physical risk on our system and financial risk
—both of which benefit our customers and our investors,” said Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&E 
Corporation.  “After the first quarter of 2023, we are on track to meet our earnings targets as 
well as our efforts to reduce non-fuel operating and maintenance costs by 2%, and we look 
forward to continued predictable results in the months ahead.”
Non-GAAP Core Earnings  
PG&E Corporation’s non-GAAP core earnings, which exclude non-core items, were $615 
million , or $0.29  per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2023 , compared with $639 million , or 
$0.30  per diluted share, during the same period in 2022 .
The change in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP core earnings per diluted share was primarily 
driven by lower operating and maintenance costs due to crews reallocated to storm response 
activity, which allowed for redeployment of other resources. Results are also driven by other 
miscellaneous items, partially offset by timing items.
Non-core items, which management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, 
totaled $46 million  after tax, or $0.02  per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2023 , compared 
with $164 million  after tax, or $0.08  per diluted share, during the same period in 2022 .
PG&E Corporation uses “non-GAAP core earnings,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in 
order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial 
performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items. See the 
accompanying tables for a reconciliation of non-GAAP core earnings to consolidated earnings 
available for common shareholders.
2023 Guidance
PG&E Corporation is updating 2023 GAAP earnings guidance in the range of $1.00  to $1.13  per 
diluted share. Factors driving GAAP earnings include costs related to unrecoverable interest 
expense of $370 million to $430 million after tax and other earnings factors, including allowance 
for funds used during construction equity, incentive revenues, tax benefits, and cost savings, net 
of below-the-line costs. Additional factors include the amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset and 
accretion of the related Wildfire Fund liability, investigation remedies, PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s reorganization cases under Chapter 11, and wildfire-related costs, partially offset by 
Fire Victim Trust tax benefits and prior period net regulatory impact.
The guidance range for projected 2023 non-GAAP core earnings is reaffirmed at $1.19  to $1.23  
per diluted share. The guidance range for non-core items, which management does not 
consider representative of ongoing earnings, is updated to $200  million to $390  million after tax.
Guidance is based on various assumptions and forecasts, including those relating to authorized 
revenues, future expenses, capital expenditures, rate base, equity issuances, and certain other 
factors.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company
Non-GAAP Core Earnings and Non-GAAP Core EPS
“Non-GAAP core earnings” and “Non-GAAP core EPS,” also referred to as “non-GAAP core earnings per share,” are 
non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP core earnings is calculated as income available for common shareholders 
less non-core items. “Non-core items” include items that management does not consider representative of ongoing 
earnings and affect comparability of financial results between periods, consisting of the items listed in Exhibit A. Non-
GAAP core EPS is calculated as non-GAAP core earnings divided by common shares outstanding (taken on a basic basis 
in the event of a GAAP loss and a diluted basis in the event of a GAAP gain). 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on “non-GAAP core earnings” and 
“non-GAAP core EPS” in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial 
performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
use non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS to understand and compare operating results across reporting 
periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term operating planning, and 
employee incentive compensation. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that non-GAAP core earnings and non-
GAAP core EPS provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business, allowing for a better comparison 
against historical results and expectations for future performance. With respect to our projection of non-GAAP core EPS 
for the years 2024-2026, PG&E Corporation is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the reconciling items that may 
affect GAAP net income without unreasonable effort. The reconciling items are primarily due to the future impact of 
wildfire-related costs, timing of regulatory recoveries, special tax items, and investigation remedies. These reconciling 
items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, the 
GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS are not substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures such as 
consolidated income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by 
other companies.
