connection with a strategic alliance with T ingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp. (T ingyi).
Our Distribution Network
Our products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks. The distribution system used depends on
customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.
Direct-Store-Delivery
We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are
merchandised by our employees or our independent
4
Table of Contents
bottlers. DSD enable s us to merchandise  with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store
promotion and merchandising.
Customer W arehouse
Some of our products are delivered from  our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products
that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover .
Distributor Networks
We distrib ute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party  distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved
by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to
restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn
sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit,  oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We
also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materia ls include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene
resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons.
Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our business due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering
our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would
prevent us from meeting our requireme nts. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such
items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments,
including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers . When
prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources
of our agricultural supply chain, including by developing our initiative to advan ce sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it globally . See Note 9
to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we manage our exposure to commodity costs.
Our Brands and Intellectual Pr operty Rights
We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Aunt
Jemima, Cap’n Crunch, Cheetos, Chester ’s, Chipsy , Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy , Diet Mist Twst, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP

Twister , V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers and Ya. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets,
including Dole and Ocean Spray . We also distribute Rockstar Energy drinks, Muscle Milk protein shakes and various DPSG brands, including Dr Pepper in certain
markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and
Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized,
through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we
license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certai n of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and
operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others.
Seasonality
Our busine sses are affected by seasonal variations. For instance, our beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and certain food and dairy sales are higher in
the cooler months. Weekly beverage and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowe st in the
first quarter . However , taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.
Our Customers
Our custo mers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass
merchandisers, membership stores, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive
contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to
charge our independ ent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality . We also
grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer . For our independent
distributors and retailers, these incenti ves include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottler s, these
incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer
incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler  equipment placement. Consumer incentives include coupons, pricing discounts and
promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support
includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace suppo rt, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising.
Vending and cooler equipment placemen t programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs
vary annually .
Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, and the current economic environment continue to increase the impor tance of
major customers. In 2016 , sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-M art), including Sam’ s Club (Sam’ s), represented approximately 13% of our total net revenue. Our top
five retail customers represented approx imately 32% of our 2016  net reven ue in North America, with Wal-Mart (including Sam’ s) representing  approximately 18%.
These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our independent bottlers.
Our Competition
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack
companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers, economy brands and other competitors. In many
countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor . Other beverage, food and snack
competitors include, but are not limited to, DPSG, Kellogg Company , The Kraft Heinz Company , Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé
S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Snyder ’s-Lance, Inc.
Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2016 , we and The
Coca-Cola Compan y represented approximately 24% and 20%, respectively , of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured
channels, according to Information Reso urces, Inc. However , The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets
outside the United States.
Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value, quality , product variety , innovation,
distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer
preferences and trends, including increa sed consumer focus on health and wellness. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of
existing products, effective introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging, pricing, increased
efficiency in production techniques, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our
brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete ef fectively .
Resear ch and Development
We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting changing consumer demands and preferences
and accelerating sustainable growth. These activities principally involve: development of new ingredients, flavors and products; reformulation and improvement in the
quality and appeal of existing products; improvement and modernization of manufacturing processes, including cost reduction; improvements in product quality , safety
and integrity; development of, and improvements in, dispensing equipment, packaging technology , package design and portion sizes; efforts focused on identifying
opportunities to transform, grow and broaden our product portfolio, including by developing products with improved nutrition profiles that reduce sodium, saturated fat
or added sugars, including through the use of sweetener alternatives and flavo r modifiers and innovation in existing sweeteners, and by offering more products with
positive nutrition including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy , protein and hydration; and improvements in energy efficiency and efforts focused on reducing our
impact on the environment. Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the United
Kingdom and the United States, and leverage nutrition science, food science, engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to continue to develop nutritious
and convenient beverages, foods and snacks.
In 2016 , we conti nued to refine our beverage, food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer demands by reducing added sugars in many of our beverages and
saturated fat and sodium in many of our foods and snacks, and by developing a broader portfolio of product choices, including: continuing to expand our
7
Table of Contents
beverage options that contain no high- fructose corn syrup and that are made with natural flavors; launching a state-of-the-art food and beverage healthy vending
initiative to increase the availability of convenient, affordable and enjoyable nutrition; further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products by building on our
important nutrition platforms and brand s — Quaker (grains), Tropicana (fruits  and vegetables), Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes) and Naked Juice (juices and
smoothies); further expanding our whole grain products globally; and further  expanding our portfolio of nutritious products in growing categories, such as dairy ,
hummus and other refrigerated dips, and baked grain snacks. In addition, we continued to make investments to reduce our impact on the environment, including: efforts
to conserv e raw materials and energy, such as by working to achieve reduction s in greenhouse gas emissions across our global businesses, by helping to protect and
conserve global water supplies especially in high water -risk areas (including conserving water within our operations and promoting the efficient use of water use in our
agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating into our operations, improvements in the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain; efforts to reduce
waste generated by our operations and disposed of in landfills; efforts to support  increased packaging recovery and recycling rates; efforts to increase energy efficiency ,
including the increased use of renewabl e energy and resources; efforts to support sustainable agriculture by expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers;
and ef forts to optimize packaging technology and design to make our packaging increasingly recoverable or recyclable with lower environmental impact.
Research and development costs were $760 million , $754 million  and $718 million  in 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , respectively , and are reported within selling, general and
administrative expenses. Consumer research is excluded from such research and development costs and included in other marketing costs.
Regulatory Matters
The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution,  sale, display , advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality , safety , transpo rtation,
disposal, recycling and use of our produ cts, as well as our occupational health and safety practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal,
state and local gove rnmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200
other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world
that apply to our businesses.
The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food  Safety
Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices;

foreign trade laws and regulations; and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer
protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of
California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.
We are also subject to numerous simila r and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governi ng food
safety , occupational health and safety , competition, anti-corruption and data privacy . In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance
to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational
compliance programs, as well as in-

house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.
In addition , certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, sale or distribution of our products,
ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form : some
apply to all beverag es, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly , some measures  apply a
single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering impos ing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the mark eting or
sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contain ed in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of
provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived conce rns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or
substances present in our products. It is possible that similar or more restrictiv e requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. Regulators may also restrict
consumers’ ability to use benefit progra ms, such as the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program in the United States, to purchase certain beverages and foods. In
addition, legislation has been enacted in certain U.S. states and in certain other countries where our products are sold that requires collection and recycling of containers
or that prohibits the sale of our beverages in certain non-refillable containers , unless a deposit, ecotax or other fee is charged. It is possible that similar or more
restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water
consumption and treatment, wastewater dischar ge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, the Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding
handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated on-site and sent to third-party owned and operated off-site licensed facilities and our facilities outside the
United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory
requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial
water use due to local water scarcity concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with
respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental
laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in
environmental comp liance requirement s, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial perform ance. In
addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related
indemnification obligations in connectio n with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries.
While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty , such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have,
a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2016 , we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 264,000 people worldwide, including approximately 113,000 people within
the United States. In certain countries, our
9

employment levels are subject to seasonal variations. We or our subsidiaries are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. We expect that we will be able to
renegotiate these collective bar gaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.  We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the factors described
below could occur or continue to occur and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our common
stock. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may
occur or become material in the future and may also adversely af fect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities.
Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results, finan cial and
business performance, events or trends.
Demand for our products may be adver sely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate or market our products effectively ,
and any significant reduction in demand could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are a global food and beverage comp any operating in highly competitive categories and markets. To generate revenues and profits, we rely on continued demand for
our products and therefore must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. In general, changes in consumption in our product categories or consumer
demographics could  result in reduced demand for our products. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in
consumer trends and preferences, including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with: health and wellness (including
products that have less sodium, added sugars and saturated fat); convenience
10
Table of Contents
(including respondin g to changes in in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns); or the location of origin or source of the ingredients and products (inclu ding the
environmental impact related to the production of our products).
Consumer preferences have been evolving, and are expected to continue to evolve, due to a variety of factors, including: the aging of the general population; consumer
concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile of certain of our produ cts, including the presence of added sugar , sodium and saturated fat in certain of our
products; growing demand for organic or locally sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the health effects of
ingredients or substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and colors, artificial sweeteners, aspartame, caffeine, high-
fructose corn syrup, partially hydrolyz ed oils, saturated fat, sodium, sugar , trans fats or other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically
engineered ingredien ts; taxes or other restrictions, including labeling requirements, imposed on our products; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding packaging
materials, such as with respect to the environmental sustainability or chemical makeup thereof; changes in package or portion size; changes in social trends that impact
travel, vacation or leisure activity patte rns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from
regulatory actions, litigation against us or other companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social media, about us,
our emplo yees, our products or advertising campaigns and marketing program s; perception of social media posts or other information disseminated by us or our
employees and executives, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors , joint venture partners or other third parties; perception of our employees, agents,
customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or the business practices of such parties; product boycotts; or a downturn in
economic condition s. Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react  to such
changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position and could adversely affect our business, reputation,
financial condition or results of operations.
Demand for our products is also dependent in part on product quality , product and marketing innovation and production and distribution, including our ability to:
maintain a robust pipeline of new produ cts; improve the quality of existing products; extend our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories; respond to
cultural differences and regional consum er preferences (whether through developing or acquiring new products that are responsive to such preferences); monitor and
adjust our use of ingredients (including to respond to applicable regulations); develop a broader portfolio of product choices and continue to increase non-carbonated
beverage offerings and other alternatives to traditional carbonated beverage offerings; develop sweetener alternatives and innovation; improve the production,
packaging and distribution of our products; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and changes in distribution channels, including in the growing e-
commerce channel; and implement effective advertising campaigns and marketing programs, including successfully adapting to a rapidly changing media envir onment
through the use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs.
Although we devote significant resour ces to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop, launch and maintain
successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner (including to correctly anticipate or effectively react to changes in consumer preferences) or
to develop and effectively execute advertising and marketing campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers. Our failure to make the right strategic investm ents to
drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer
perception of our existing brands and may result in inventory write-of fs and other costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Table of Contents
Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
The condu ct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations adminis tered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as
government entities and agencies outside the United States, including laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display , advertising,
marketing, labeling,  content, quality , safety , transportation, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety
practices. In addition, in many jurisdicti ons, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is
compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of these laws and regulations have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products
are made, manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emer ging markets, may be less developed or certain. For example, products
containing genetically engineered ingre dients are subject to varying regulatio ns and restrictions in jurisdictions in which our products are made, manuf actured,
distributed or sold. In addition, these laws and regulations and related interpreta tions may change, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly , as a result of a variety of
factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertis ing and
marketing practices; laws and treaties related to international trade, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products
and tariffs; laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain of our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are market ed; laws
and progr ams aime d at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at
discouraging the consumption or alterin g the package or portion size of certain of our products, including laws imposing restrictions on the use of government funds or
programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the United States, to purchase certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and
increased litigation involving product claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain
of our products, including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; regulatory initiatives, including the imposition or proposed
imposition of new or increased taxes or other measures impacting the manufacture, sale or distribution of our products; accounting rules and interpretations;
employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities;
environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water treatment and dischar ge of wastewater and air emissions and laws relating to the disposal,
recovery or recycling of our products and their packaging. Changes in regulator y requirements, and competing regulations and standards, where our products are made,
manufactured, distri buted or sold, may result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, which could adversely affect our business,
reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
The imposition by any jurisdiction in the United States or outside the United States of new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpreta tions, or
changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, labeling, product or producti on requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale or advertisement of
certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products, may continue to
alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our products, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions
may follow and the requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, may also result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid). For example, if
one jurisdi ction imposes a tax on sugar -sweetened beverages or foods, or impos es a specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose similar or
other measures that impact the manufacture, sale or distribution of our products. The foregoing may result in decreased demand for our
12
Table of Contents
products, adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid).
In addition, studies are underway by third parties to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products,
such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, added sugars, saturated fat and sodium. Third parties, such as the World Health Organization, have also published documents or
studies claiming that taxes can address consumer consumption of sugar -sweetened beverages and other foods high in sugar , sodium or saturated fat. If, as a result of
these studies and documents or otherwise, there is an increase in consumer concerns (whether or not valid) about the health implications of consumption  of our
products, an increase in the number of jurisdictions that impose taxes on our products, or an increase in new labeling, product or production requirements or other
restrictions on the manufacturing, sale or display of our products, demand for our products could decline, or we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations that
could af fect sales of our products, any of which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, suppliers, or other third parties with
whom we do business could take actions, intentional or not, that violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or
regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, penalties, disgor gement of profits or activity restrictions, any of which could result
in adverse publicity or affect our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may have
enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizu re of products or assets or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on the
sales of products in our portfolio or could lead to damage to our reputation.
In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as
environmental remediation, product liability , toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities and contractual
obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of
unidentified contam inants on current and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ
materially from the costs we have estimated. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our estimates or otherwise have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The impo sition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Certain jurisdictions in which our produ cts are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the
manufacture, sale or distribution of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our
products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric
sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added
sugar in the beverage. For example, effective January 2017, the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States enacted a per-ounce surchar ge on all sweetened
beverages (including  artificially and non-caloric sweetened beverages). By contrast, the U.K. has proposed a graduated tax, in which the per-ounce tax rate is tied to the
amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added  sugar , the higher the per-ounce tax rate. These tax measures - whatever their scope or
form - could increase the cost of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity
13
Table of Contents
(whether based in scientific fact or not ) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellnes s needs.
Such factors could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may reduce demand for such products and could
adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Certain jurisdictions  in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning
requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of
provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived conce rns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or
substances present in our products. For example, in California in the United States, Proposition 65 requires a specific warning on any product that contains a substance
listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.
In additio n, some jurisdictions, including Chile and Peru, have adopted labeling requirements or have begun to require color -coded labeling of certain food and
beverage products where black, red, yellow and green are used to indicate vario us levels of a particular ingredient, such as sodium, saturated fat or sugar . In addition, a
number of other jurisdictions both in and outside the United States are considering similar measures. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional product
labeling or warning requirements could reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based in scientific fact or not) or leave
consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in laws and regulations relating to packaging or disposal of our products could continue to increase our costs and reduce demand for our products or
otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recoverable for recycling but not all packaging is recovered, whether due to low value, lack of
infrastructure or otherwise. The United States and many other jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies designed to encourage
recycling, including requiring that deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, distribution, marketing and use of certain packaging;
extended producer responsibility policie s which makes brand owners responsible for the costs of recycling products after consumers have used them; and adopting or
extending product stewardship policies which could require brand owners to plan for and, if necessary , pay for the recycling or disposal of packaging after consumers
have used them. Compliance with these laws and regulations could continue to affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further , our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not
to act, responsibly with respect to packaging or disposal of our products.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suf fer if we are unable to compete ef fectively .
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack
companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local, and private label manufacturers, economy brands and other competitors. In many
countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor . Other beverage, food and snack
competitors include, but are not limited to, DPSG,
14
Table of Contents
Kellogg Company , The Kraft Heinz Company , Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Snyder ’s-Lance, Inc.
Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value, quality , product variety , innovation,
distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer
preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness. If we are unable to effectively promote our existing products or introdu ce new
products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective or if we are otherwise unable to compete effectively (including in distributing our products
effectively and cost efficiently through all existing and emer ging channels of trade, including through e-commerce), we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or
category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expe nditures, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Our busin ess, finan cial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of political conditions in the markets in which our products are
made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
Political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufacture d, distributed or sold may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operat ions. For example, the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has created uncertainty regarding how the
United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure and during the time leading up to its departure. In addition, many of the
markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have recently held, or will hold in the near future, elections, the results of whic h could
create uncertainty regarding how existing laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, climate change regulation, taxes, the movement of
goods, services and people between countries and other matters, and could result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic
uncertainty . Any changes in, or the impo sition of new, laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations due to elections, referendums or other
political conditions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely af fected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emer ging markets, including Mexico, Russia, Brazil, the Middle East, China and
India. However , there can be no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will
be accepte d or be successful in any particular developing or emer ging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer
preferences or otherwise. The following  factors could reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our business in developing and emerging
markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions, acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest; increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain
of these markets and the related impact on developed countries who export to these markets; volatile oil prices and the impact on the local economy in certain of these
markets; our inability to acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete divest itures or
refranchisings; imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other restrictions; imposition of new or increased sanctions against, or
other regulations restricting contact with, certain countries in these markets, or imposition of new or increased sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations
operating in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or
other third parties; imposition of taxes on our products or the ingredients or substances used in our products; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of
our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners, customers or other
15
Table of Contents
third parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; regulations relating to the repatriation of funds
currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly-inflationary economies, devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Mexican peso,
Russian ruble, Egyptian pound and the Argentine peso, or demonetization of currency , such as the withdrawal in India of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes; regulation s on the
transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries,
from time to time, or could significantly affect our ability to effectively manag e our operations in certain of these markets and could result in the deconsolid ation of
such businesses, such as the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015; the lack of well-established or reliable
legal syste ms; increased costs of doing  business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations,
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences,  such as
the assessm ent of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emer ging
markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these
markets, our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely af fected.
Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Many of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distri buted and sold have experienced and continue to experience unfavorable economic
conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns. Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in the United
States and globally , including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including speculative influences; highly-infl ationary
economies, devaluat ion, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects
of government initiatives, including demonetization, austerity or stimulus measures to manage economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives;
the effects of any default by or deteriora tion in the credit worthiness of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold or of countries
that may then impac t countries in which  our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced demand for our products resulting from volatility in general
global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic  reasons or otherwise to regional, local or private label products or other lower -cost
products, or to less profitable channels;  or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or
funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our customers,
consumers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In additio n, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute  transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial banks, insurance companies,
investment banks and other financial institutions, may be exposed to a rating s downgrade, bankruptcy , liquidity , default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable
economic condition s, changing regulatory requirements or other factors beyon d our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy , receivership, default or similar event
involving a major financial institution, or changes in the regulatory environment, may limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter into financial
transactions with us, including to provid e banking or related cash management services, or to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; may leave
us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials; or may result in a declin e in the
market value of our investments in debt securities, which could have an adverse
16
Table of Contents
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similar risks exist with respect to our customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors and joint venture
partners and could result in their inability to obtain credit to purchase our products or to finance the manufacture and distribution of our products resulting in product
delays, which could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our busin ess and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber
incidents or if our information system s, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise
disrupted.
We depend on information systems and technology , some of which are provided by third parties, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities
important to our business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to engage in marketing activities; to enable and improve the effectiveness of our
operations; to order and manage materials from suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage our facilities; to conduct research and development; to maintain financial
accuracy and efficiency; to comply with regulatory , financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information; to
communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our independent bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors,
joint ventures, suppliers and other third parties; and to communicate with our investors.
As with other global  companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Cyber attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently , are constantly evolving
in nature, are becom ing more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist
organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or
other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental
reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms includ ing cyber extortion, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware, such as
ransomware through phishing emails, or password theft. To date, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has to our knowledge had a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information
technology infrastru cture, including monitoring networks and systems, upgradi ng our security policies and the skills and training of our employees, and requi ring our
third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify
or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as
a result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures,
technology develop ment defects, user errors, or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social
engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business could be disrupted and we could, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors; processing inefficiencies; the
loss of, or failure to attract new, customers and consumers; lost revenues resulting from the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information
technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or the loss of a competitive advantage due to the unauthoriz ed use,
acquisition or disclosure of, or access to, confidential information; the incurrence of costs to restore data and to safeguard against future extortion attempts; the loss of,
or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data or other assets; alteration, corruption or loss of
accounting, financia l or other data on which we rely for financial reporting and other purposes, which could cause delays in our financial reporting; damag e to our
reputation; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions or fines; violation of data privacy , security or other laws and regulations; and
17
Table of Contents
remediation costs. Further , our information systems and the information stored therein could be compromised by, and we could experience similar adverse
consequences due to, unauthorized outside parties accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information, corrupting information or disrupting business
processes (or demonstrating an ability to do so) or by inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, agents or third parties. We continue to devote significant
resources to network security , backup and disaster recovery , and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide
absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or disruption. In addition, due to the constantly evolving
nature of these security threats, the form and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
Similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions,
including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used
by third parties and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-par ty vendors may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that may arise. As a result,
we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly
impact our systems or information.
While we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and
data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types
of claims that may arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials,  energy ,
water and other supplies.
We and our busines s partners use variou s raw materials, energy, water and other supplies in our business. The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and
snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrat es, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit and other fruits, oats,
oranges, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key
packaging materials include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods,
aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses
due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products.
Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experienc ing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions, and some are
available from a limited number of suppliers or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. The raw materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for
the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by
many factors, including changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), disease or pests, agricultural
uncertainty , health epidemics or pandemics, governmental incentives and controls, political uncertainties, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Shortage
of some of these raw materials and other supplies, sustained interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Many of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are
subject to fluctuatio n, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivatives. If commodity price
changes result in unexpected or significant increases in raw materials
18
Table of Contents
and energy costs, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against commodity price increases to offset these
increased costs without suffering reduce d volume, revenue, margins and operati ng results. In addition, certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify
for hedge accounting treatment and, therefore, can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot price s of the
underlying commodities.
Water is also a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality and increasing pressure to conserve water in areas of
scarcity and stress may lead to: suppl y chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including additional
investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce water consumption); higher production costs; the cessation of operatio ns at, or
relocation of, our facilities or the faciliti es of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; or damag e to our
reputation, any of which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our ability , and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture partners, distributors and customers, to make,
manufacture, transpo rt, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their operations due to any of the following
factors could impair  the ability to make, manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse weather conditions (including any potential effects
of climate change) or natural disaster , such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flooding; government action; economic or political uncertainties or insta bility in
countries in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may also affect our ability to protect the security of our assets and employees; fire;
terrorism; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; food safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or otherwise; health epide mics or
pandemics; supply and commodity shortages; unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or enhancements of facilities in which such products
are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents, including the disruption or shutdown of computer systems
or other information technology systems  at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities; industrial accidents or other occupational health and
safety issues; telecommunications failures; power or water shortages; strikes and other labor disputes; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers
and other third parties. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur ,
could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore operations.
Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality , safety and integrity could adversely affect our business, reputation,
financial condition or results of operations.
Product contaminati on or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality , safety and integrity , including with respect to raw mater ials and
ingredients obtained  from suppliers, or allegations (whether or not valid) of product quality issues, mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, allergens, adulter ation or
contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which
could adve rsely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become unfit for
consumption or cause injury , illness or death, or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new
categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we could decide to, or be required to, recall products in our portfolio and/or we may be subject to
liability or government action, which could result in payment of damages or fines, cause
19
Table of Contents
certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction of product inventory , or result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid),
which could reduce consumer demand and brand equity . Moreover , even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not
fit for consumption are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes could adversely affect our reputation
or brands. Our business could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality , safety and integrity generally , even if such loss of confidence
is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if
we do not have adequate insurance, if we do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or
other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world. Maintaining a good reputation
globally is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether
or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental practices for all of our operations and activities, including with respect to
human rights and workplace safety , or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so; the failure to achieve our goals of reducing added sugars,  sodium
and saturated fat in certain of our products and of growing our portfolio of product choices; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals or to be perceived as
appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; the failure to protect our intellectual property , including in the event our brands are used without our
authorization; health concerns (whether or not valid) about our products or particular ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, our products, including concerns
regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes, labeling requirements or other
limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale, display or advertising of our products; any failure to comply , or perception of a failure to comply , with our policies and goals,
including those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consump tion from sugar -sweetened beverages; our research and development efforts; the recall
(voluntary or otherwise) of any products in our portfolio; our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water , energy use and waste
management; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impa ct on the environment, or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to water
use and the environment; the practices of our employees, agents, customers, distributors, suppliers, bottlers, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others
in our industry) with respect to any of the foregoing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our industry; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns or
marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; consumer perception of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents, customers,
suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry); or our responses or the responses of others in our industry
to any of the foregoing.
In addition, we operate globally , which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-corruption laws, competition laws and
tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the event that our employees engage in improper
activities, we may be subject to enforcement actions, litigation, loss of sales or other consequences, which may cause us to suf fer damage to our reputation in the United
States or abroad. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to mainta in an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial
information could also hurt our reputation. In addition, water is a limited resource in many
20
Table of Contents
parts of the world and demand for wate r continues to rise. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act,
responsibly with respect to water use.
Further , the popularity of social media and other consumer -oriented technologi es has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. As a result,
negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; our use of social media or of
posts or other infor mation disseminated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties;
consumer perception of any of the foregoing, or failure by us to respond effectiv ely to any of the foregoing, may also generate adverse publicity (whether or not valid)
that could damage our reputation.
Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand  for our
products and could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.
Failure to successf ully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or effectively manage divestit ures or
refranchisings, could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We regula rly review  our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. Potential
issues associated with these activities could include, among other things: our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies
as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transact ion; and
diversion of management’ s attention from day-to-day operations.
With respect to acquisitions, the following factors also pose potential risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired
company , including integrating the acquired company’ s manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and
information technology systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives
and key employees; conforming standar ds, controls (including internal control over financial reporting, environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and
compliance with other regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and
streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures and avoiding increased operating expenses; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing
customers and attracting new customers; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; coordinating geographically dispersed
organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems
or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation.
With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsi bility with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies,
priorities or resources as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or
other actio ns or omissions of our joint venture partners may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise
damage our reputation and brands and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures outside of
the United  States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States, including fluctuations in exchange rates and compliance with
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside the United States.
21
Table of Contents
With respect to divestitures and refranchisings, we may not be able to complete  or effectively manage such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all
and may fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divest iture or refranchising. Further , as divestitures and refranchisings may reduce our direct
control over certain aspects of our busin ess, any failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain may adversely
impact our sales or business performance.
If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, or if a divestiture or refranchising is not successfully
completed or managed or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely af fected.
A change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future  performance of our businesses could result in an impairment charge, whic h could
materially af fect our results of operations.
We conduct impairment tests on various  components of our portfolio annually , during our third quarter , or more frequently , if circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable or that an other -than-temporary impairment exists. Any changes in our estimates or underlying assumptions regarding the future
performance of our divisions or in determining the fair value of any such division, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments
and other long-lived assets, could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: significant
negative economic or industry trends or competitive operating conditions; significant macroeconomic conditions that may result in a future increase in the weighted-
average cost of capital used to estimat e fair value; and significant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding assets or markets that do not perform
consistently with our expectations, inclu ding factors we use to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. Future impairment charges could have a
significant adverse ef fect on our results of operations in the periods recognized.
Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income
tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction. Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion
of our income and income tax associated with repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations. In addition, many of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant
operations, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Changes in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in
how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the Interna l Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-
income based taxes both within and outside the United States. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate , or the
adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation
could dif fer from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
22

Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity initiatives or global operating model could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition
or results of operations.
Our future  success and earnings growth depend, in part, on our ability to continu e to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Our productivity initiatives help support our
growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We continue to implement strategic plans that we believe will position our business for future success and
long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack
categories and markets. We are also continuing to implement our global operating model to improve efficiency , decision making, innovation and brand mana gement
across the global PepsiCo organization to enable us to compete more effectively . Further , in order to continue to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and our global
operating model, it will be necessary to make certain investments in our busines s, which may be limited due to capital constraints. Some of these measures could yield
unintended consequ ences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced employee morale and productivity , and unexpected
additional employee attrition, including the inability to attract or retain key personnel. It is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to continue to lead
and execute our plans, including to effectively manage personnel adjustments and transitions resulting from these initiatives and increased competition for employees
with the skills neces sary to implement our plans. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives and global operating model as planned, fail to
implement these initiatives as timely as we anticipate, do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or unant icipated
costs in implementing these initiatives, fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the future, or fail to successfully manage business
disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or productivity , we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, whic h could
adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
If we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
Our continued growth requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We compete to recruit and hire
new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competenc ies. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and
our contin ued abilit y to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organizatio n. Any
unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Of ficer, or to hire and
retain a highly skilled and diverse work force could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to
increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our reputation,
business, financial condition or results of operations.
The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer or changes to the retail landscape could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
Our custo mers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass
merchandisers, membership stores, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationsh ips with
our key customers, including Wal-Mar t, to compete effectively . The loss of any of our key customers or a significant reduction in sales to a key custome r could
adversely affect our business, financial  condition or results of operations. In addition, our industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, including
increased consolidation of retail ownership and purchasing power , particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers with increased
purchasing power , which may impact our ability
23
Table of Contents
to compete in these areas. Such retailers may demand improved efficiency , lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further , should larger retailers increase
utilization of their own distribution networks, other distribution channels such as e-commerce, or private label brands, or if we are unable to develop successful
relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers, the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded. In
addition, failure to appropriately respon d to any such actions, to offer effectiv e sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers or to adapt to the rapidly
changing retail and e-commerce landscapes could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and product availability at our retailers, adversely affect our ability
to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to resolve a
dispute with any of our key customers, or if there is a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, our
business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely af fected.
Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely af fected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability ,
levels of indebtedne ss, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally , as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-
current state of the economy and our industry generally . Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment
grade, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and
credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, and result in a reduction in our liquidity . We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which
we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. However , any downgrade of our current
short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically , and therefore
require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market could also be adversely
affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to
access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity could adversely af fect our financial condition and results of operations.
If we are not able to successfully imple ment shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively , our ability to conduct our business
might be negatively impacted.
We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize certain information technology support services and administrative functions, including
payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and may enter into agreements for shared services in other
functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. In addition, we utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors
to process, transmit and store informati on and to conduct certain of our busin ess activities and transactions with employees, customers, consumers and other third
parties. If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively , or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance, we may not be able to
achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed.
Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or
sensitive data throug h security breaches or otherwise, effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, or damage to our reputation, which could have a
negative impact on employee morale.
24
Table of Contents
We continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide
systems solutions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we
fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and ef ficiently , and remain in step with the changing
needs of our busine ss, which could result in the loss of customers or consumers. In addition, the failure to either deliver the applications on time, or antici pate the
necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and revenue.
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Because our consolidated financial statements are
presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar , are translated
into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil , gene rate a significa nt portion of
our net revenue. In addition, we purch ase many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous markets and in numerous
currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and may continue to have, an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Climate change, water scarcity or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity may negatively affect our busin ess and
operations or damage our reputation.
There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the
frequency and severity of extreme weat her and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity , we may be
subject to decreased  availability or less favorable pricing for certain commod ities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats,
potatoes and variou s fruits. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain and
unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumer ’s ability to purchase, our products. The predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges
regarding the availability and quality of water . As demand for water access continues to increase around the world, we may be subject to decreased availability of water ,
deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water , which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.
The continued increasing concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or
mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. In the event that such
regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and
water conservation, we may experience disruptions in, or significant increase s in our costs of, operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional
investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular , increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the cost of energy,
including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby substantially increasing the distribution and supply chain costs
associated with our products. As a result, the ef fects of climate change or water scarcity could negatively af fect our business and operations.
In addition, any perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate  change
or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could adversely af fect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
25
Table of Contents
There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on these and other environmental
sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and water use. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are
perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment.
A portion  of our workforce belongs to unions. Failure to successfully negoti ate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages, could cause our
business to suf fer.
Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or
work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we are unable  to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on
satisfactory terms, which could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial
condition or results of operations. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise
affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our ef ficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy .
If we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, the value  of our
products or brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents,
business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to a variety of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production
and the design and operation of various  equipment used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark,
copyright, patent and trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our intellectual property . If we
fail to obtain or adeq uately protect our trademarks, copyrights, patents, business  processes and trade secrets, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in
law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property , the value of our products and brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced
and there could be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving
the quality of existi ng products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly , such finding could have an adverse
impact on our reput ation, business, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing
products.
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, legal proceedings or investigations could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal claims, proceedings and investigations, including but not limited to litigation related to our advertising, marketing
or comme rcial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients including, sugar , sodium and saturated fat, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or
misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others and environmental, employment and insurance matters. We evaluate legal claims to assess the likelihood
of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losse s and establish reserves as appropriate. Litigation is inherently uncertain and there is no
guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in litigation, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential
losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such litigation. In the event that management’ s assessment of actual or potential claims
and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that
26
Table of Contents
is material  arises in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Defending ourselves from  claims,
including non-meritorious claims, may also require us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that may
damage our reputation or brand image, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Many factors may adversely af fect the price of our publicly traded securities.
Many factors may adversely affect the price of our common stock and publicly traded debt. Such factors, some of which are beyond our control, may include , but are
not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in financial or tax reporting and changes in accounting principles or practices that materially affect our
reported financial condition and results; investor perceptions of our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; actions by shareholders or others
seeking to influence our business strate gies; speculation by the media or investment community regarding our business, strategies and performance or those of our
competitors; trading  activity in our securities or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our securities; changes in our credit ratings; the impact of our
share repurchase programs or dividend policy; and the outcome of referenda and elections. In addition, corporate actions, such as those we may or may not take from
time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure and our strategy , including as a result of business, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, may
not have the impact we intend and may adversely affect the price of our securitie s. The above factors, as well as the other risks included in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,”
could adversely af fect the price of our securities.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current report s from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our
2016  fiscal year and that remain unresolved.

Item 3. Legal Pr oceedings.
As previously disclosed, in January 2011, Wojewodzka Inspekcja Ochrony Srodowiska, the Polish environmental control authority , began an audit of a bottling plant of
our subsidiary , Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers Poland SP, z.o.o. (PCGB), in Michrow , Poland. In July 2013, Wojewodzka Inspekcja Ochrony Srodowiska alleged that the
plant was not in compliance in 2009 with applicable regulations governing the taking of water samples for analysis of the plant’ s waste and sought monetary sanctions
of $650,000 and, in August 2013, PCGB appealed this decision. In April 2015, the General Environmental Inspector for Environmental Protection upheld the sanctions
against PCGB and, in May 2015, PCG B further appealed this decision. In October 2015, Viovodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw rejected our appeal and, in
December 2015, PCGB filed an extraordinary appeal in the Supreme Administrative Court.
In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal, administrative, regulatory and government proceedings, claims and inquiries arising in the normal
course of business. While the results of these proceedings, claims and inquiries  cannot be predicted with certainty , management believes that the final outcom e of the
foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Sanctions imposed by foreign authorities are levied in
local curre ncy and disclosed using the U.S. dollar equivalent at the time of imposition and are subject to currency fluctuations. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory
Matters.” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

OUR BUSINESS
Executive Overview
We are a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of enjoyable brands, including Frito-Lay , Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and
Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient
and enjoyable beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.
Our mana gement monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. These indicators include growth in volume, net revenue,
organic revenue, operating profit (as reported and excluding certain items and the impact of foreign exchange translation), earnings per share (EPS) (as reported and
excluding certain items and the impact of foreign exchange translation), retail sales, market share, safety , innovation, product and service quality , organizationa l health,
brand equity , media viewership and engagement, employee diversity , net commodity inflation, productivity savings, net capital spending, free cash flow and free cash
flow excluding certain items, cash returned to shareholders in the forms of share repurchases and dividends, advertising and marketing expenses, resea rch and
development expend itures, return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC (excluding certain items), and gross and operating margins (as reported and excluding
certain items).
At PepsiCo, we believe our performance is inextricably linked to the sustainability of the world in which we operate. We call this approach Performance with Purpose
and it is embedded into our business and our strategy . Our commitment to Performance with Purpose enabled us to meet or exceed every financial goal we set for 2016.
During 2016, we also continued our focus on productivity , prudent capital alloca tion, reducing our cash flow cycle, operating with a leaner cost structure and embracing
innovation. For example, since 2012 our productivity agenda has delivered approximately $1 billion in annual savings by pursuing cost-saving measures ranging from
developing agricultural technologies to sourcing more of our foods and beverages locally . We continued to embrace automation across the Company , leverag ing new
tools that we believe will deliver higher rates of production in the United States and around the world. We also continued to focus on skills upgrading and job
retraining, creating new opportunities for our workers which we believe will help us navigate continued geopolitical uncertainty and unrest.
As we look to 2017 and beyond, we believe our Performance with Purpose strategy will enable us to continue delivering strong financial results while positioning our
Company for long-term sustainable growth. We recently announced new Performance with Purpose goals for the next ten years. We plan to continue to focus on
making healthier foods and beverages for our consumers, generating healthy growth for our retail and foodservice partners; fostering a healthier planet by reducing our
environmental impact and boosting our bottom line; creating a healthy workplace and culture for our associates; and promoting healthier communities wher ever we
operate.
Our strate gies are also designed to address key challenges facing our Company , including: consumer demand for healthier products; taxes or other limitation s on the
manufacture, sale or distribution of our products in a changing regulatory environment; uncertain and volatile macroeconomic conditions, including currency
42
Table of Contents
fluctuations; climate  change and water scarcity; and political, economic and social instability . See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information about risks
and uncertainties that the Company faces. We believe that many of these challenges also create new opportunities for our Company and we intend to focus on the
following areas to address and adapt to these challenges and capitalize on these opportunities:
Healthier products.
Consumer demand continues to shift towards healthier products, while the risk of regulation, including taxation of certain products, continues to intensify . Given these
consumer and regulatory shifts, we continue to shift our portfolio toward more “good-for -you” and “better -for-you” products, through both organic innovation and
strategic mergers and acquisitions. We have increased our investment in research and development by 45 percent since 2011, investing approximately $3.5 billion on
research and development cumulatively over the past five years.
Healthy retail growth.
Our success is depe ndent on the succes s of our retail partners. We continue to collaborate with our retail partners to sell our products faster , increase cash flow and
engage consumers. We also intend to continue to invest in building the new capabilities we will need to succeed in the digital marketplace, including the evolving e-
commerce landscape, and to focus on building and sustaining strong relationships with our retail partners.
A healthier planet.
As a global food and beverage manufacturer , our success depends on the availability of key natural resources required to make our products, including water . We
believe that embrac ing environmentally responsible business practices, such as water conservation, water replenishment and energy efficiency will help sustain our
business. We contin ue to take steps to reduce our environmental footprint, which also allows us to streamline costs and reinvest savings in our business. By improving
our water and energy efficiency , reducing packaging materials, cutting waste and promoting sustainable farming practices around the world, we have saved over $600
million over the past five years.
A healthy workplace.
Our assoc iates are our most valuable asset. We believe that by engaging our associates with opportunities for personal development and promoting ethic s in the
workplace we can attract the best talent, enhance productivity , spur innovation and position our company to successfully navigate a constantly changing
macroeconomic environment.
Healthier communities.
We are a global company , operating in more than 200 countries and territories, but we consider ourselves to be a member of every local community where we operate.
By being responsible and responsive to the needs of our communities, we believe we strengthen our business , positioning the Company for long-term success.

Other Relationships
Certain members of our Board of Direct ors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection
and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms
negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employ ees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies
of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
Our Business Risks
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During 2016 and 2015 , certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold
operated in a challen ging environment, experiencing unstable economic, politic al and social conditions, civil unrest, debt and credit issues, and currency fluctuations.
We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable
impacts on our future results.
In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased
taxes on the manufacture, sale or distribution of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the
production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages
with a caloric sweet ener (e.g., sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single  tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the
amount of added sugar in the beverage.
We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snack in more than 200 count ries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, and the amount of revenue
attributable to such products, varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot  predict the scope or form potential taxes or other potential limitations on our products
may take, and there fore cannot predict the impact of such taxes or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes and limitations may impact us and our
competitors differently . We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and
to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with
respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes or limitations.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to
address key challenges.
Risk Management Framework
The achiev ement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks. To identify , assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks
across the Company’ s operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:
•PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’ s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’ s primary responsibilities is
overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company’ s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the
Company’ s top risks. The Board receives updates on key risks throughout the year. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with
oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.
◦The Audit Committee of the Board revie ws and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’ s risk management and oversight processes, and
assists the Board’ s oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo;
44
Table of Contents
◦The Comp ensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’ s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and
practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior; and
◦In 2017, the Board established a Public  Policy and Sustainability Committee to assist the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’ s policies, programs and
related risks that concern key public policy and sustainability matters.
•The Pepsi Co Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo’ s
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify , assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance,
safety , reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation ef forts to the Board;
•Division and key country risk committe es, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify , assess, prioritize and address
division and country-specific business risks;
•PepsiCo’ s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC
and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as
with PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board;
•PepsiCo’ s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing ef fectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and
•PepsiCo’ s Compliance & Ethics Department leads and coordinates our compliance policies and practices.
Market Risks
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal course  of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives,
global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving
opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing
agreements. See “Unfavorable economi c conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.” and “Our business,
financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, energy, water and other
supplies.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.
The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below . See Note
9 to our consolidated financial statemen ts for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion
of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
Inflationary , deflationary and recessiona ry conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
for further discussion.
45
Table of Contents
Commodity Prices
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $0.8 billion  as of December 31, 2016  and $1.0 billion  as of December 26, 2015 . At the end of 2016 , the
potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net
unrealized gains in 2016  by $89 million .
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our net revenue in 2016 , with Mexico, Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil  comprising
approximately 19% of our net revenue in 2016 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign  exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold. During 2016 , unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted net revenue performance by 3 percentag e points, primarily due to
the Mexican peso, Russian ruble, Pound sterling, Egyptian pound, Argentine peso and the Canadian dollar . Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not
offset could adversely impact our future financial results.
In addition , volatile  economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold,
including in Brazil, China, Greece, India, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey , and currency fluctuations in certain of these international markets continue to
result in challenging  operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the referendum in the United Kingdom to
leave the European Union, and the potential impact, if any , for the ESSA segment and our other businesses.
Starting in 2014, Russia announced economic sanctions against the United States and other nations that include a ban on imports of certain ingredients and finished
goods from  specific countries. These sanctions have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations in Russia or our
consolidated results or financial position, and we will continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in Russia closely . For the years ended
December 31, 2016 , December 26, 2015  and December 27, 2014 , total net revenue generated by our operations in Russia represented 4%, 4% and 7% of our
consolidated net revenue, respectively . As of December 31, 2016 , our long-lived assets in Russia were $4.4 billion .
Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion  as of December 31, 2016  and $2.1 billion  as of December 26, 2015 . The total notional amount
of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $0.8 billion  as of December 31, 2016 . At the end of 2016 , we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change
in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2016 by $122 million .
Conditions in Venezuela, including restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange markets, have
resulted in an other -than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and the U.S. dollar . The exchange restrictions and other conditio ns have
significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our businesses in Venezuela, including limiting our ability to import certain raw materials and to settle U.S.
dollar -denominated obligations, and have restricted our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our Venezuelan businesses. We expect these conditi ons will
continue for the foreseeable future.
As a result of these factors, we conclude d that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not meet the accounting criteria for control over our wholly-
owned Venezuelan subsidiaries, and we no longer had significant influence over our beverage joint venture with our franchise bottler in Venezuela. Therefore, effective
at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and
joint venture using the cost method of
46
Table of Contents
accounting. We reduced the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The factors that led to our conclusions at
the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist through the end of 2016.  For further information, please refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements
and “Items Af fecting Comparability .”
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, our financial results have not included the results of our Venezuelan businesses. We do not have any guarantees related to our
Venezuelan entities, and our ongoing contractual commitments to our Venezuelan businesses are not material. We will recognize income from dividends and sales of
inventory to our Venezuelan entities, which have not been and are not expected to be material, to the extent cash in U.S. dollars is received. We did not receive any cash
in U.S. dollars from  our Venezuelan entities during the fourth quarter of 2015 or fiscal year 2016. We will continue to monitor the conditions in Venezuela and their
impact on our accounting and disclosures. In 2015, the results of our operations in Venezuela, which include the months of January through August, generate d 2% of
net revenue and 2% of operating profit, prior to the impairment char ges of $1.4 billion.
Inter est Rates
Our intere st rate derivatives had a total notional value of $11.2 billion  as of December 31, 2016  and $12.5 billion  as of December 26, 2015 . Assuming year-end 2016
investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2016  by $20 million  due to
higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels as compared with our variable rate debt.
OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and
subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the
likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical
plans, our critical accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting. With the exception of our change in 2016 to the full yield
approach to estimate  the service and interest cost components for our pension and retiree medical plans as described below , we applied our critical accounting policies
and estimation methods consistently in all material respects, and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies with our Audit
Committee.
Our critical accounting policies are:
•revenue recognition;
•goodwill and other intangible assets;
•income tax expense and accruals; and
•pension and retiree medical plans.
Revenue Recognition
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment
within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment. We recognize revenue
upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However , our policy for DSD and certain chilled
products is to remove and replace dama ged and out-of-date products from store  shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.
Similarly , our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-

Table of Contents
of-date products. Based on our experience with this practice, we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product
shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product.
For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.
As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumer s. Total
marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a
reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to
gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to
our independent bottlers through funding  of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent  bottlers
and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on contract
terms and our histor ical experience with similar programs and require managem ent judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels.
Differences between estimated expense  and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are
determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our
incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pourin g rights,
may extend beyond one year. Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of
revenue, and the remaining balances of $291 million  as of December 31, 2016  and $321 million  as of December 26, 2015  are included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.
For interim  reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same
year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim
period’ s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts  at each
interim period, any changes in estimates  and the related allocation of sales incen tives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition,
we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements for additional information on our total marketplace spending. Our annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology .
We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility , the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis
of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in our income statement.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase  brands
and other intangible  assets in acquisition s. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other
intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on
an evaluation of a number of factors, such
48
Table of Contents
as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash
flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with
marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally
range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including
market share, consumer awareness, brand history , future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries
in which the brand is sold.
In connection with previous acquisition s, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute
beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual
bottling arrangemen ts, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit
the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory , contrac tual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights
are considered as indefinite-lived, with the balance amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually , using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.
We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter . Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more
likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical
financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment
exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
The quant itative assessment requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’ s strategic business plans,
annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on
market data available at the time. Signif icant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to
estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptio ns used in our impairment evaluations for nonamortizable intangible assets, such as
forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and
operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.” See Note 2 to
our consolidated financial statements for additional information on performing the quantitative assessment.
Amortizable intangi ble assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the
undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 , December 26, 2015  and December 27, 2014 . We
recognized no material impairment charges for nonamortizable intangible assets in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 , December 26, 2015  and
December 27, 2014 . As of December 31, 2016 , the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at NAB exceeded
their carrying values. However , there could be an impairment of the carrying value of NAB’ s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and
49
Table of Contents
their contribution to the operating resul ts of NAB’ s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future
increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of macroeconomic conditions in Russia and Brazil on the
estimated fair value of our indefinite-liv ed intangible assets in these countries and have concluded that there is no impairment as of December 31, 2016 . However , there
could be an impairm ent of the carrying value of certain brands in these count ries if there is a further deterioration in these conditions, if future revenues and their
contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted- average
cost of capital used to estimate fair value.
Income T ax Expense and Accruals
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant
judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions
are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challeng e and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related
interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. See “Increases in income tax rates, changes  in income tax laws or
disagreements with tax authorities could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations. ” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly
operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. W e consider the tax adjustments from the resolution
of prior year tax matters to be among such items.
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate
reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that
are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already
recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some portio n or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements
for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial
statements.
In 2016 , our annual tax rate was 25.4%  compared to 26.1%  in 2015 , as discussed in “Other Consolidated Results.” The tax rate decreased 0.7 percentage points
compared to 2015 reflecting  the impac t of the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges, which had no corresp onding tax benefit, partially offset by the 2015 favorable
resolution with the IRS of substantially all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2010 and 2011, as well as the 2016 impairment charge recorded to reduce
the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in T AB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Plans
Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a
combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age
and service requirements. Generally , our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar
50
Table of Contents
amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree
medical benefits.
In 2016, we approve d an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the combination of two plans effective December 31,
2016, and the spinof f of a portion of the combined plan into a pre-existing plan effective January 1, 2017. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were
unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A, or active plan, and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan
I, or inacti ve plan. The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to
reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the active plan will continue to be amortized over the average remaining service life of the active
participants (approx imately 11 years beginning in 2017), while the actuarial gains and losses associated with the inactive plan will be amortized over the remain ing life
expectancy of the inactive participants (approximately 27 years beginning in 2017). As a result of these changes, benefit plan pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by
approximately $40 million in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed the obligatio n to pay
and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary contributions of $452 million primarily to fund the transfer of the
obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge of $242 million ($162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share). See “Items Affecting Comparability” and
Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
In 2014, we offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment
equal to the present value of the participant’ s pension benefit (payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or Individual Retirement Account (IRA)).
In 2014, we made a discretionary contribution of $388 million  to fund substantially all of these paym ents. As a result, we recorded a pre-t ax pension lump sum
settlement charge in corporate unallocated expenses of $141 million  ($88 million  after-tax or $0.06  per share). See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements.
Our Assumptions
The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while
working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of
benefits earned by employees for worki ng during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost),
and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover , retirement age and mortality;
•the expected return on assets in our funded plans;
•for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings;
•for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and
•for pensio n and retiree medical expens e, the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the present value of liabilities and, beginning in 2016, to
determine service and interest costs.
51
Table of Contents
Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’ s best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment
involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.
At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our
liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve
includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our
liabilities.
Effective as of the beginning of 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our U.S. and
the majori ty of our significant internat ional pension and retiree medical plans. Historically , we estimated the service and interest cost components using  a single
weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation (or accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for the
retiree medical plans) at the beginning of the period. We have now elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by
applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We have made this change
to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates, which we believe will result in a more precise
measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligation. We have accounted for this change in estimate on a
prospective basis as of the beginning of 2016. The pre-tax reduction in net periodic benefit cost associated with this change was $125 million ($81 million after-tax or
$0.06 per share) for the full year 2016.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy . Although we
review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of
return.
The health  care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plan’ s liability and expense is reviewed annually . Our review is based on our claims experience,
information provide d by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry . Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as
demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:  
 2017  2016  2015
Pension      
Service cost discount rate (a)4.3% 4.5% n/a
Interest cost discount rate (a)3.5% 3.8% n/a
Expense discount rate  (a)n/a  n/a  4.1%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.2% 7.2% 7.3%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.2% 3.2% 3.5%

Service cost discount rate (a)4.0% 4.3% n/a
Interest cost discount rate (a)3.2% 3.3% n/a
Expense discount rate  (a)n/a  n/a  3.8%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.5% 7.5% 7.5%
Current health care cost trend rate 5.9% 6.0% 6.2%
(a) In the first quarter of 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of pension and retiree medical expense.
52
Table of Contents
In general , lower discount rates increase the size of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense in the following year, while higher discount rates reduce the
size of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense. Based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2017
primarily driven by cost savings due to the recognition of prior experience gains on plan assets, the reorganization of the plans and the transfer of our obligation for
certain retirees to an unrelated insurance company , partially of fset by lower discount rates.
Sensitivity of Assumptions
A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. Under the full-yield-curve
approach adopted at the beginning of 2016, a 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would increase the
2017  pension and retiree medical expense as follows:
Assumption  Amount
 
Discount rates used in the calculation of expense  $37
Expected rate of return  $36
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.
Funding
We make contributio ns to pension trusts  that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations
that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally , we do not fund our pension
plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund
these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.
Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected
asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. See Note 7 to our consoli dated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future
benefit payments.

OUR FINANCIAL RESUL TS
Results of Operations — Consolidated Review
In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below , “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over -year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive
activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over -year combined
impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowan ces. Additionally , “acquisitions and divestitures,” except as otherwise noted, reflect all
mergers and acquisitions activity , including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiar ies and
nonconsolidated equity investees. The impact of the structural change related to the deconsolidation of our V enezuelan businesses is presented separately .
Volume
Our beverage volume in the NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments reflects sales to authorized bottlers, independent distributors and retailers, as well as
the sale of beverage s bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks that have been sold through our authorized independent bottlers. Bottler case sales (BCS) and
concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not necessarily equal during  any given period due to seasonality , timing of product launches, product mix, bottler
inventory practices and other factors. While our beverage revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume, as there are independent bottlers in the supply chain, we
believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the consumer level. Sales of products from our unconsolida ted joint
ventures are reflected in our reported volume. NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market,
distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and NAB further , either independently or in
conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, AMENA
licenses the T ropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with T ingyi.
Our food and snacks volume in the FLN A, QFNA, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments is reported on a system-wide basis, which includes our own sales and
the sales by our noncontrolled af filiates of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks.
Servings
Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect
our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines
for single-serving sizes of our products.
In 2016  and 2015 , total servings increased 3% and 1% compared to 2015  and 2014 , respectively . Excluding the impact of the 53rd reporting week, total servings in 2016
increased 2% compared to 2015. Servings growth reflects adjustments to the prior year results for divestitures and other structural changes, includ ing the
deconsolidation of our V enezuelan businesses ef fective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015.

2016
Total operating profit increased 17% and operating mar gin increased 2.3 percentag e points. Operating profit grow th was driven by the benefit of actions associated with
our productivity initiatives, which contributed more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of expense categories throughout all of our segments, effective
net pricing and volume growth. Additionally , the impact of recording an impa irment charge in the prior year and ceasing the operations of our MQD joint venture
contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing
expenses, unfavorable foreign exchange  and higher commodity costs, as well as the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses, which reduced operating profit
growth by 2 percentage points. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) contributed 13 percentage points to operating profit growth and
increased total operating profit margin by 1.5 percentage points, primarily reflecting a 17-percentage-point contribution from the prior -year Venezuela impairment
charges. Higher commodity inflation reduced operating profit growth by 1 percentage point, primarily attributable to inflation in the Latin America, ESSA and
AMENA segments, partially offset by deflation in the NAB, FLNA and QFN A segments. The impact of our 53rd reporting  week was fully offset by incremental
investments we made in our business. Corporate unallocated expenses decreased 1%, driven by lower pension expense reflecting the change to the full yield curve
approach, lower foreign exchange transaction losses and decreases in other corporate expenses, partially offset by increased contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation,
Inc. to fund charitable and social programs and the net impact of items af fecting comparability mentioned above included in corporate unallocated expenses.
2015
Total operating profit decreased 13% and operating margin decreased 1.2 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by certain operating
cost increases, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher commodity costs and increased advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by
effective net pricing , the benefit of actions associated with our productivity initiatives, which contributed more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of
expense categories throughout all of our segments, and volume growth. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted
operating profit performance by 9 percentage points and decreased total operating profit mar gin by 1.4 percentage points, primarily reflecting the V enezuela impairment
charges. Higher commodity inflation negatively impacted operating profit performance by 5 percentage points, primarily attributable to inflation

in the Latin America and ESSA segme nts, partially offset by deflation in the NAB, FLNA, AMENA and QFNA segments. Additionally , impairment charges in the
QFNA segment associated with our MQD joint venture and the fourth quarter impact of our Venezuelan businesses (as a result of the deconsolidation) each negatively
impacted reported operating profit performance by 1 percentage point. Corp orate unallocated expenses decreased 27%, primarily reflecting the impact of items
affecting comparability mentioned above included in corporate unallocated expenses and decreased pension expense, partially offset by increased research and
development costs and char ges associated with productivity initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans.

2016
Net interest expense increased $321 million  reflecting a charge of $233 million representing the premium paid in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption
provisions to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million,
respectively . This increase also reflects higher average debt balances, partially offset by higher interest income due to higher average cash balances, as well as gains on
the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation costs.
The report ed tax rate decreased 0.7 percentage points due to the impact of the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges, which had no corresponding tax benefit, partially
offset by the 2015 favorable resolution  with the IRS of substantially all open  matters related to the audits for taxable years 2010 and 2011, as well as the 2016

evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial
measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate compa rison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating  results,
and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our
performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understan ding of
our ongoing financial and business perfo rmance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or
losses (non-cash); gains or losses associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; charges related to restructuring program s; asset
impairments (non-cash); amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; pension and retiree medical related items; debt redemptions; and remeasurement s of net
monetary assets. See below and “Items Af fecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. 
Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial
information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP . In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP
measures presented by other companies.
The following non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this 2016 Form 10-K:
•operating profit/loss , adjusted for items affecting comparability , and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items
affecting comparability , and the corresponding constant currency growth rates;
•organic revenue;
•free cash flow; and
•ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items af fecting comparability .

Operating Profit/Loss, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability , and Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share – Diluted, Adjusted for Items Affecting
Comparability , and the corr esponding Constant Curr ency Gr owth Rates
Operating profit/loss, adjusted for items affecting comparability , and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting
comparability , each excludes the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodities that do not qualify for hedge accounting,
restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans, charges related to the transaction with Tingyi, a charge related to debt
redemption, pension -related settlements,  Venezuela impairment charges, a tax benefit, and a Venezuela remeasurement charge (see “Items Affecting Comparabi lity” for
a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on these measures on a constant currency basis, which measures our financial results
assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior -year period. In order to compute our
constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply
or divide, as appropriate, those amount s by the prior -year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evalua ting the
results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance.
Organic Revenue
We define organic revenue as net revenue adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other
structural changes, including the Venezuela deconsolidation, for the comparable period. The Venezuela deconsolidation impact excludes the results of our Venezuelan
businesses for the first three quarters of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, our fiscal 2016 reported results include an extra week of results. Organic
revenue excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results
of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year .
See “Or ganic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review .”
Free Cash Flow
We define  free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property , plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is
essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational  capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we
believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing
activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have
certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from this measure.
See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
ROIC and Net ROIC, Excluding Items Affecting Comparability
We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average
common shareholders’ equity . Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly , the method used by
management to calculate ROIC may dif fer from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.
We believ e this metric serves as a measu re of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting compara bility , to
compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that are not
58
Table of Contents
indicative of our ongoing performance  and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting
comparability , as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting compa rability .
We believ e the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting  comparability , provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant
comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation ef ficiency .
See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Com modity
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge  accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated
expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently
reflected in division  results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects
of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
In connect ion with our 2014 Productivit y Plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $990  million , of which approximately $705 million  represents cash
expenditures, summarized by year as follows:
  Charges  Cash
Expenditur es  
2013  $ 53  $ —

2018 (expected)  129  127  
  $ 990(a) $ 705  
(a)This total pre-tax charge is expected to consist of approximately $495 million of severance and other employee-related costs, approximately $150 million for asset impairments (all non-cash)
resulting from plant closures and related actions, and approximately $345 million for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs. This
charge is expected to impact reportable segments and Corporate approximately as follows: FLNA 11%, QFNA 2%, NAB 30%, Latin America 20%, ESSA 25%, AMENA 5% and Corporate 7%.
(b)In 2015 and 2014, cash expenditures include $2 million and $10 million, respectively, reported on our cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical plan contributions.
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans.
We regula rly evalua te different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial
statements.
Charges Related to the T ransaction with T ingyi
In 2016, we recorded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million ($0.26 per share) in the AMENA segment to reduce the value of our 5% indirec t equity
interest in T AB to its estimated fair valu e. 
In 2015, we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million ($0.05 per share ) in the AMENA segment related to a write-of f of the value of a call option to increase
our holding in T AB to 20%.
See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

purchase of a group annuity contract. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
In 2015, we recorded pre-tax benefits of $67 million ($42 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) in the NAB segment associated with the settlement of pension-related
liabilities from previous acquisitions. These benefits were recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses.
In 2014, we recorde d a pre-tax pension lump sum settlement charge in corporate  unallocated expenses of $141 million ($88 million after-tax or $0.06 per share) related

See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
Venezuela Remeasur ement Charge
In 2014, we recorde d a $105 million  net charge related to our remeasurement of the bolivar for certain net monetary assets of our Venezuelan businesses. $126 million
of this charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, with the balance (equity income of $21 million ) recorded in our Latin America segment. In total, this net
charge had an after -tax impact of $ 105 million  or $0.07 per share.

2016
Net revenue grew 5%, driven by volume growth and ef fective net pricing. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to the net revenue growth.
Volume grew 3%, reflecting high-single-digit growth in variety packs, and mid-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos and Cheetos. These gains were partial ly offset
by a mid-single-digit decline in our Sabra joint venture products. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to the volume growth.
Operating profit grew 8%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, as well as lower commodity
costs, which contrib uted 3 percentage points to operating profit growth, primarily fuel and cooking oil. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost
increases, including  strategic initiatives, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentag e points to operating profit
growth, partially of fset by incremental investments in our business, which reduced operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points.
2015
Net revenue grew 2% and volume grew  1%. The net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing and the volume growth. The volume growth reflects mid-
single-digit growth in variety packs and trademark Tostitos, double-digit growth in trademark Smartfood and low-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos. These
increases were partially of fset by a low-single-digit decline in trademark Lay’ s.
Operating profit grew 6%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, as well as lower commodity
costs, which contributed 5 percentage points to operating profit growth, primarily cooking oil and packaging. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating
cost increases, including strategic initiatives, as well as higher advertising and marketing expenses.

Net revenue grew 1%, driven by the 53rd reporting week which contributed 2 percentage points to the net revenue growth, partially of fset by unfavorable net pricing and
mix and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Volume grew 2%, reflecting mid-single digit growth in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix and low-single-digit growth in ready-to-eat cereals, oatmeal, and bars. The 53rd
reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to the volume growth.
Operating profit increased 16%, impacted by prior year impairment charges related to our dairy joint venture and ceasing its operations, which contributed 17
percentage points to operating profit growth. This increase also reflects planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, as well as lower commodity
costs, which contributed 6 percentage points to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses, certain
operating cost increases and the unfavorable net pricing and mix. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentag e points to operating profit growth, partially offset by
incremental investments in our business, which reduced operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points.
2015
Net reven ue declined 1% and volume  grew slightly . The net revenue decline reflects unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net revenue
performance by 2 percentage points, partially offset by the volume growth. The volume growth reflects mid-single digit growth in ready-to-eat cereals and Aunt
Jemima syrup and mix, partially of fset by a double-digit decline in MQD products and mid-single digit declines in both grits and bars.
Operating profit decreased 10%, reflecting impairment charges, including a fourth quarter charge related to ceasing operations of our dairy joint venture and the
recognition of a gain associated with the divestiture of a cereal business in 2014, which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 12 and 3 percentage
points, respectively . In addition, operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing
expenses. These impacts were partially offset by planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, favorable mix and the volume growth, as well as lower
commodity costs, which positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit performance.

Volume increased 1%, driven by a 6% increase in non-carbonated beverage volume, partially offset by a 2% decline in CSD volumes. The non-carbonated beverage
volume increase primarily reflected a double-digit increase in our overall water portfolio, a mid-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks, and a high-single-digit
increase in Lipton ready-to-drink teas.
Operating profit increased 15%, reflect ing the net revenue growth and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, as well as lower commodity

Our Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financin g, such
as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash
available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments and scheduled debt maturities, include cash from operations and proceeds
obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt. However , there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not
impair our ability to access these marke ts on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our
credit facilities. See also “Our Business  Risks” and “Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
As of December 31, 2016 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries of $15.2 billion outside the United States. As
of December 31, 2016 , cash, cash equivale nts and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions
were not material. To the extent foreig n earnings are repatriated, such amounts would be subject to income tax liabilities, both in the United States and in various
applicable foreign jurisdictions.
Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are
generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales  patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter . On a continuing basis, we consider
various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases,
productivity and other ef ficiency initiatives, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
The table below summarizes our cash activity:  
 2016  2015  2014
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,404  $ 10,580  $ 10,506
Net cash used for investing activities $ (7,148 ) $ (3,569 ) $ (4,937 )
Net cash used for financing activities $ (2,942 ) $ (3,828 ) $ (8,264 )
Operating Activities
During 2016 , net cash provided by operating activit ies was $10.4 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in the prior year. The operating cash flow performance reflects
discretionary pension contributions of $459 million. In addition, working capital (comprised of changes in accounts and notes receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses
and other current assets, and accounts payable and other current liabilities, each adjusted for the effects of currency translation) reflects unfavorable comparisons to the
prior year . These decreases were partially of fset by lower net cash tax payments in the current year .
During 2015 , net cash provided by operating activit ies was $10.6 billion, compared to $10.5 billion in the prior year. The operating cash flow performance in part
reflects lapping the impact of prior -year discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions, pertaining to the lump sum settlement payments, in the United States
of $388 million ($261 million after-tax). In addition, working capital (comprised of changes in accounts and notes receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other
current assets, and accounts payable and other current liabilities, each adjust ed for the effects of currency translation and the Venezuela deconsolidation) reflects
favorable comparisons to the prior year . These increases were partially of fset by unfavorable operating profit performance.

Table of Contents
Investing Activities
During 2016 , net cash used for investing activities was $7.1 billion, primarily reflecting net purchases of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of
$4.1 billion and net capital spending of $2.9 billion.
During 2015 , net cash used for investing activities was $3.6 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $2.7 billion, a reduction of cash of $568 million due to
the deconsolidation of our V enezuelan subsidiaries and net purchases of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $317 million.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division and for further discussion of Venezuela. See Note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities.
We expect 2017  net capital spending to be approximately $3 billion , within our long-term capital spending tar get of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.
Financing Activities
During 2016 , net cash used for financing activities was $2.9 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend
payments and share repurchases of $7.2 billion and debt redemptions of $2.5 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $4.7 billion, net proceeds
from short-term borrowings of $1.5 billion, and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5 billion.
During 2015 , net cash used for financing activities was $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend
payments and share repurchases of $9.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $4.6 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options  of $0.5
billion.
We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity . On February 11, 2015, we announced
a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $12.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock commencing from July 1, 2015 and expiring on June 30,
2018. In addition, on February 15, 2017 , we announced a 7.0% increase in our annualized dividend to $3.22 per share from $3.01 per share, effective with the dividend
that is expected to be paid in June 2017. We expect to return a total of approxim ately $6.5 billion to shareholders in 2017 through share repurchases of approx imately
$2.0 billion and dividends of approximately $4.5 billion.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.”

Table of Contents
We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to
our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will ensure appropriate financial
flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However , see “Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets
may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credi t ratings.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that
may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any down grade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors
which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to
us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade  of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility
that we have experie nced historically , and therefore require us to rely more heav ily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Our borrowing costs and access to
capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks”
and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

Long-term contractual commitments, except for our long-term debt obligations, are generally not recorded on our balance sheet. Operating leases primarily represent
building leases. Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are primarily for oranges, orange juice and certain other commodities. Non-cancelable marketing
commitments are primarily for sports marketing. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on
an annual basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments. See Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements for additional information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our
financial condition or liquidity .

Table of Contents
We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for
us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contrac ts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers
directly . Consequently , these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party , we could be liable to these suppliers in the
event of any nonpayment by our bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 — Basis of Pr esentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates
that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability
to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not contr ol these
other af filiates, as our ownership in these other af filiates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
Raw mate rials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw
materials handling facilities, are inclu ded in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product are included in selling, gene ral and
administrative expenses.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based
compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for
perpetual brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we
believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditi ons, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and
their ef fect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could dif fer significantly from these estimates.
Effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries from our consolidated financial statements and began accoun ting for
our investments in our wholly-owned V enezuelan subsidiaries and joint venture using the cost method of accounting. See subsequent discussion of “V enezuela.”
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December , resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. Our fiscal 2016 results include an extra
week. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, most of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. Certain
operations in our ESSA segment report on a weekly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for 2016, reflecting the extra week in
the fourth quarter:
 
Quarter   United States and Canada   International
First Quarter   12 weeks   January , February
Second Quarter   12 weeks   March, April and May
Third Quarter   12 weeks   June, July and August
Fourth Quarter   17 weeks   September , October , November and December
See “Our Divisions” below , and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated results, see further unaudited information
in “Items Af fecting Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilutio n unless
noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Reclassifications were made to prior years’ amounts to conform to the current year presentation, including
81
Table of Contents
the presentation of certain functional support costs associated with the manufacturing and production of our products within cost of sales. These costs were previously
included in selling, general and adminis trative expenses. For the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, these reclassifications resulted in an increase
in cost of sales of $347 million  and $354 million , respectively , with a corresponding reduction to gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in the
same years. These reclassifications reflect changes in how we are classifying costs of certain support functions as a result of ongoing productivity and efficiency
initiatives. These reclassifications had no impact on our consolidated net revenue, operating profit, net interest expense, provision for income taxes, net income or EPS.
Our Divisions
Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of conven ient and
enjoyable beverages , foods and snacks,  serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territ ories with our largest operations in North America,
Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to
our divisions and are considered our reportable segments. For additional unaudi ted information on our divisions, see “Our Operations” contained in “Item 1. Business.”
The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:
•share-based compensation expense;
•pension and retiree medical expense; and
•derivatives.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee
compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense in 2016  was appro ximately 14% to FLNA,  2% to QFNA , 22% to NAB, 7% to Latin America,
11% to ESSA,  10% to AMENA and 34% to corpora te unalloc ated expenses. We had similar allocations of share-based compensation expense to our divisions in 2015
and 2014 . The expense alloc ated to our division s excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which
division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Expense
Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates, as well as amortization of costs related to certain pension plan amendments and gains and
losses due to demographics (including mortality assumptions and salary experience) are reflected in division results for North American employees. Division results
also include interest costs, measured at fixed discount rates, for retiree medic al plans. Interest costs for the pension plans, pension asset returns and the impact of
pension funding, and gains and losses other than those due to demographics, are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. In addition, for our North American
plans, corporate unallocated expenses include the difference between the servic e costs measured at a fixed discount rate (included in division results as noted  above)
and the total service costs determined using the plans’ discount rates as disclosed in Note 7.
Derivatives
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals . Commodity
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge  accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated
expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on
82
Table of Contents
the underl ying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying comm odity in
operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in
corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
Net revenue and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows:

Corporate Unallocated
Corporate unallocate d includes costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as research and development projects, unallocated insurance and
benefit programs, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, commodity derivative gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives and certain
other items.

Venezuela
Prior to the end of the third quarter of 2015, the financial position and results of operations of our Venezuelan snack and beverage businesses, which consist of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries and our beverage joint venture with our franchise bottler in Venezuela, were included in our consolidated financial statements and reported
under highly-inflationary accounting, with the functional currency of the U.S. dollar .
Conditions in Venezuela, including restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange markets, have
resulted in an other -than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and the U.S. dollar . The exchange restrictions and other conditio ns have
significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our businesses in Venezuela, including limiting our ability to import certain raw materials and to settle U.S.
dollar -denominated obligations, and have restricted our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our Venezuelan businesses. We expect these conditi ons will
continue for the foreseeable future.
As a result of these factors, we conclude d that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not meet the accounting criteria for control over our wholly-
owned Venezuelan subsidiaries, and we no longer had significant influence over our beverage joint venture with our franchise bottler in Venezuela. Therefore, effective
at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and
joint venture using the cost method of accounting. W e recorded pre- and after -tax char ges of $1.4 billion  in our income statement to reduce the
85

value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The impairment charges primarily included approximately $1.2
billion  related to our invest ments in previously consolidated Venezuelan subsidiaries and our joint venture and $111 million  related to the reclassification of cumulative
translation losses. The estimated fair value of the investments in our Venezuelan entities was derived using discounted cash flow analyses, including U.S. dollar
exchange and discount rate assumption s that reflected the inflation and economic uncertainty in Venezuela, and are considered non-recurring Level 3 measu rements
within the fair value hierarchy . The factors that led to the above-mentioned conclusions at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist through the end of
2016.
As of the end of 2016, consistent with the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not consolidate the assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our balance
sheet. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, our financial results have not included the results of our Venezuelan businesses. We do not have any guarantees related
to our Venezuelan entities, and our ongoing contractual commitments to our Venezuelan businesses are not material. We will recognize income from divide nds and
sales of inventory to our Venezuelan entities, which have not been and are not expected to be material, to the extent cash in U.S. dollars is received. We did not receive
any cash in U.S. dollars from our Venezuelan entities during the fourth quarter of 2015 or fiscal year 2016. We will continue to monitor the conditions in Venezu ela and
their impa ct on our accounting and disclosures. For further unaudited information, see “Our Business Risks” and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However , our policy for DSD and
certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and
freshness they expect. Similarly , our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. Based on our experience with
this practice, we have reserved for antic ipated damaged and out-of-date products. For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies,
including our policy on bad debts, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Wal-Mart. In 2016 , sales to Wal-Mart (including Sam’ s) represented approximately
13% of our total net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which are used in finished goods sold by them to Wal-Mart. We have not
experienced credit issues with these customers.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts,
advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to custom ers for
performing merchandising activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and
discounts to promote lower retail prices . It also includes support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
While most of these incentive arrangem ents have terms of no more than one year, certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year.
Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining
balances of $291 million  as of December 31, 2016  and $ 321 million  as of December 26, 2015  are includ ed in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets
on our balance sheet . For additional unaudited information on our sales incentiv es, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Advertising and other marketing activiti es, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.2 billion  in 2016  and $3.9 billion  in both 2015  and 2014 ,
including advertising expenses of $2.5 billion  in 2016 , $2.4 billion  in 2015  and $2.3 billion  in 2014 . Deferred advertising costs are not expe nsed until the year first used
and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•promotional materials in inventory; and
•production costs of future media advertising.
Deferred advertising costs of $32 million  and $40 million  as of December 31, 2016  and December 26, 2015 , respectively , are classified as prepaid expenses and other
current assets on our balance sheet.
Distribution Costs
Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses
were $9.7 billion  in 2016 , $9.4 billion  in 2015  and $9.7 billion  in 2014 .
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Software Costs
We capitalize certain computer software  and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when
both the preliminary  project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include only (i) extern al direct
costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated
with the software projects and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in proper ty, plant
and equipm ent on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate
five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $214 million  in 2016 , $202 million  in 2015  and $208 million  in 2014 . Net capitalized software and development costs
were $791 million  and $863 million  as of December 31, 2016  and December 26, 2015 , respectively .
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other
commercial obligations. W e recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. For additional unaudited information on our
commitments, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Research and Development
We engag e in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally . Consumer research is
excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $760 million , $754 million  and $718
million  in 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , respectively , and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.
See “Research and Development” in “Item 1. Business” for additional unaudited information about our research and development activities.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually , using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.
We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter . Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more
likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical
financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment
exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment of indefi nite-lived intangible assets, if the carry ing amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, as
determined by its discounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Quantitative assessment of goodwill is performed  using a
two-step impairment test at the reportin g unit level. A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division. The first step compares the carrying value of a
reporting unit, including goodwill, with its estimated fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its
estimated fair value, we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record, if any. In the second step, we determine
an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the estimate d fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill
(including any unrecognized intangible assets). The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of
that good will. The quantitative assessment, described above requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted
average cost of capital) based on marke t data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating,
macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluat ions for
nonamortizable intangible assets, such as forecasted growth rates and weighte d-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are
consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.
Amortizable intangi ble assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the
undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted
In 2016, the Financ ial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to clarify how certain cash receipts and payments should be presented in the cash flow
statement. The guidance is effective in 2018 with early adoption permitted. We early adopted the provisions of this guidance retrospectively during our fourth quarter of
2016, including in connection with the debt redemption discussed in Note 8; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In 2015, the FASB issued guidance that changes the subsequent measurement for certain inventory methods from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and
net realizable value. We adopted the provisions of this guidance during our fourth quarter of 2016; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Y et Adopted
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance to clarify how restricted cash should be presented in the cash flow statement. The guidance is effective in 2018 with early adoption
permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption of this guidance.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-
maturity debt securi ties, loans and other  instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will replace today’ s incur red loss
model and generally will result in earlie r recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for -sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measur e credit
losses in a manner similar to current practice, except that the losses will be recognized as an allowance. The guidance is effective in 2020 with early adoption permitted
in 2019. W e are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption.

In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition in the
income statement of the income tax effects of vested or settled awards on a prospective basis. Additionally , within the cash flow statement, the guidance requires the
excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements to be presented within operating activities and withholding tax payments upon vesting of restrict ed stock
units (RSU s), performance stock units (PSUs) and PepsiCo equity performance units (PEPunits) to be presented within financing activities. We will apply the change in
the presentation on the cash flow statem ent retrospectively . The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee’ s shares for tax withholding
purposes and not classify the award as a liability that requires valuation on a mark-to-market basis. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for
forfeitures as they occur. We will continue to apply our policy of estimating forfeiture rates. We will adopt this guidance beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and the
impact on our financ ial statements will be dependent on the timing of award vesting or exercises, our tax rate and the intrinsic value when awards vest or are exercised.
For the years 2016 and 2015, our excess tax benefits recognized were $110 million  and $107 million , respectively . If we had applied this standard in 2016 and 2015, the
impact would have been a $0.07  increase to EPS in both years. For the years 2016 and 2015, the impact to our operating cash flow was an increase of $269 million  and
$284 million , respectively .
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the requirement that an investor retrospectively apply equity method accounting for an investment originally
accounted for by another method. The guidance requires that an equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current
basis of the investor ’s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the ability to exercise significant influence is achiev ed. The
guidance is ef fective and we will adopt prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets, but record expenses on their income statements in a manner
similar to current accounting. For lessor s, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The guidance is
effective in 2019 with early adoption permitted. We expect this adoption will result in an increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We commenced our
assessment of the impact of the guidance on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee perspective. See Note 13 for our minimum lease payments under
non-cancelable operating leases.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to measure investments in certain equity securities at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in
net incom e. The guidance is effective in 2018 and early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements,
including the impact on certain of our investments in noncontrolled affiliates and our available-for -sale securities. See Note 9 for further information on our available-
for-sale securities.
In 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective
and we will adopt retrospectively begin ning in the first quarter of 2017. The impact of the guidance to our 2016 balance sheet is a reclassification of $639 million  of
assets from current to non-current on our balance sheet. See Note 5 for further information on deferred taxes.
In 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition, with final amend ments issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a five-step model to determine the
revenue recognized for the transfer of goods or services to customers that reflects the expected entitled consideration in exchange for those goods or services. It also
provides clarification for principal versus agent considerations and identifying performance obligations. In addition, the F ASB introduced practical expedients related to
disclosures of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments to guidance on collectability , non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and
other similar taxes. Financial statement disclosures required under the guidance will enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, judgments and uncertainty
of revenue

and cash flows relating to customer contracts. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the full retrospective approach or a cumulativ e effect
adjustment to the opening retained earnings in the year of adoption (cumulative ef fect approach). The guidance is ef fective in 2018, with early adoption permitted.
We are utilizing a comprehensive appro ach to assess the impact of the guidance  on our contract portfolio by reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to
identify potential differences that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts, including evaluation of our performance obligations,
principal versus agent and variable consideration. We continue to make significant progress on our contract reviews and are also in the process of evaluating the impact,
if any, on changes to our business processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new guidance and, based on the foregoing, we do not
currently expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements. We are continuing with our implementation plan and currently expect to adopt the
new guidance beginning in 2018 using the cumulative ef fect approach.

The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our food,
snack and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturin g automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing
certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization
structures to drive ef ficiency . The 2014 Productivity Plan is in addition to the 2012 Productivity Plan and is expected to continue the benefits of that plan.
In 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , we incurr ed restruc turing charges of $160 million  ($131 million  after -tax or $0.09  per share), $169 million  ($134 million  after-tax or $0.09  per
share) and $357 million  ($262 million  after-tax or $0.17  per share) , respectiv ely, in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan. All of these charges were recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily relate to severance  and other employee-related costs, asset impairments (all non-cash), and other costs
associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2016  is
expected to be paid by the end of 2017 .

2012 Multi-Y ear Productivity Plan
The 2012  Productiv ity Plan, publicly announced on February 9, 2012, included actions in every aspect of our business that we believe would strengt hen our
complementary food, snack and beverage businesses by: leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo’ s operations, go-to-market and information
systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing, warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified
organization structu res, with wider spans of control and fewer layers of manag ement. The 2012 Productivity Plan has enhanced PepsiCo’ s cost-competitiveness and
provided a source of funding for future brand-building and innovation initiatives.
In 2015  and 2014 , we incurr ed restruc turing charges of $61 million  ($50 million  after -tax or $0.03  per share) and $61 million  ($54 million  after-tax or $0.04  per share),
respectively , in conjunction with our 2012 Productivity Plan. All of these charges were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily related to

Other Productivity Initiatives
There were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans in 2016. In 2015 , we
incurred charges of $90 million  ($66 million  after-tax or $0.04  per share) related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives, including $48 million  in Latin
America, $5 million  in ESSA, $20 million  in AMENA and $17 million  in Corporate. In 2014, we incurred charges of $67 million  ($54 million  after-tax or $0.04  per
share) related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives, including $11 million  in Latin America, $26 million  in ESSA and $30 million  in AMENA. Non-cash
charges in 2015 and 2014 were $10 million  and $13 million , respectively . These amounts were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily
reflect severance and other employee-r elated costs and asset impairments (all non-cash). These initiatives were not included in items affecting comparabili ty. Cash
payments in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $43 million , $57 million  and $3 million , respectively . Substantially all of the accrual of $29 million  at December 31, 2016  is
expected to be paid by the end of 2017.
We regularly evaluate dif ferent productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above.

Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 31, 2016  and using average 2016  foreign exchange
rates, is expected to be as follows:
  2017 2018 2019  2020  2021
Five-year projected amortization  $ 62  $ 60  $ 57 $ 57 $ 55
Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these
circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted
future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine wheth er events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. For
additional unaudited information on our policies for amortizable brands, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

Nonamortizable Intangible Assets
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 , December 26, 2015  and December 27, 2014 . We
recognized no material impairment charges for nonamortizable intangible assets in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 , December 26, 2015  and
December 27, 2014 . As of December 31, 2016 , the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at NAB exceeded
their carry ing value s. However , there could be an impairment of the carrying value of NAB’ s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their
contribution to the operating results of NAB’ s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in
the weigh ted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia and Brazil on the
estimated fair value of our indefinite-liv ed intangible assets in these countries and have concluded that there is no impairment as of December 31, 2016 . However , there
could be an impairm ent of the carrying value of certain brands in these count ries if there is a further deterioration in these conditions, if future revenues and their
contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted- average
cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For additional information on our policies for nonamortizable intangible assets, see Note 2.

Reserves
A number of years may elapse before a particular matter , for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax
audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows:
Jurisdiction  Years Open to Audit  Years Currently Under Audit
United States  2010, 2012-2015  2012-2013
Mexico  2011-2015  2014
United Kingdom  2014-2015  None
Canada (Domestic)  2011-2015  2011-2014
Canada (International)  2009-2015  2010-2014
Russia  2012-2015  2013-2015
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter , we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome
of known tax contingencies. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular issue
would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. For further unaudited
information on the impact of the resolut ion of open tax issues, see “Other Consolidated Results” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condi tion and
Results of Operations.
In 2015, we reached  an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2010 and 2011 (two immaterial  matters
were still open as of December 31, 2016). The agreement resulted in a 2015 non-cash tax benefit totaling $230 million .
As of December 31, 2016 , the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1,885 million . We accrue interest related to reserves for
income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest
accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $193 million  as of December 31, 2016 , of which $61 million  of expens e was recognized in 2016 . The gross amount of interest
accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $144 million  as of December 26, 2015 , of which $14 million  of expense was recognized in 2015 .
A rollforward of our reserves for all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions, is as follows:
 2016  2015
Balance, beginning of year $ 1,547  $ 1,587
Additions for tax positions related to the current year 349  248

Carryforwards and Allowances
Operating loss carryforwards totaling $11.3 billion  at year-end 2016  are being  carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to
use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.1 billion  in 2017 , $9.9 billion  between
2018  and 2036 and $1.3 billion  may be carried forw ard indefinitely . We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Undistributed International Earnings
As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $44.9 billion  of undistributed international earnings.  We intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the United
States for the forese eable future and, therefore, have not recognized any U.S. tax expense on these earnings. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of
unrecognized U.S. tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.
Note 6 — Shar e-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation program  is designed to attract and retain empl oyees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders.
PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, PEPunits and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder -approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-T erm Incentive
Plan (LTIP) (previously named the 2007 Long-T erm Incentive Plan). A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified
price. Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are
awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’ s performance against specified
targets. During the vesting period, RSUs  and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and
becomes payable. PEPunits provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in PepsiCo’ s absolu te stock
price as well as PepsiCo’ s Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three -year perfo rmance period. Beginning in 2016, certain executive officers and
other senior executives were granted long-term cash awards for which final payout is based on PepsiCo’ s Total Shareholder Return relative to a specific set of peer
companies and achievement of a specified performance tar get over a three-year performance period.
The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and
PEPunits.
As of December 31, 2016 , 82 million  shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the L TIP.
The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense:
 2016  2015  2014
Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 284  $ 295  $ 297
Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 5 —  —
Restructuring and impairment char ges/(credits) 5 4 (3)
Total $ 294  $ 299  $ 294
Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 91  $ 77  $ 75
As of December 31, 2016 , there was $321 million  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized
compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.

Table of Contents
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions
We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the
date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs is measured at the market
price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant with the exception of market-based awards, for which we use the Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine the fair
value. The Monte-C arlo simulation model uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however , it also further incorporates into the fair-value
determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Compensation costs related to these awards are recognized regardless of whether the market
condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. Long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation
guidance are valued through the end of the performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model until actual performance is
determined.
All stock option grants have an exercise  price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term. We do not
backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively . Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the L TIP.
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three  years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to
the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period throug h the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to
provide service to earn the award. Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of
stock options or RSUs, or a combinatio n thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been
granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and, through 2015, were granted a combination of 60% PEPunits measuring both
absolute and relative stock price perfor mance and 40% long-term cash based on achievement of specific performance operating metrics. Beginning in 2016, certain
executive officers and other senior executives were granted 66% performance stock units and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established
performance targets. Certain executives are granted performance-based stock units which require the achievement of specified financial and/or operational performance
metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance
with the terms established at the time of the award.
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:
2016 2015 2014
Expected life 6 years 7 years 6 years
Risk-free interest rate 1.4% 1.8% 1.9%
Expected volatility 12% 15% 16%
Expected dividend yield 2.7% 2.7% 2.9%
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-
free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expecte d life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical
period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share
repurchases and stock price. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards  that are
expected to vest.

Note 7 — Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans
In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed the obligatio n to pay
and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary contributions of $452 million  primarily to fund the transfer of the
obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge of $242 million  ($162 million  after-tax or $0.11 per share). See additional unaudited information in
“Items Af fecting Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Effective as of the beginning of 2016, we prospectively changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic bene fit cost.
The pre-ta x reduction in net periodic benefit cost associated with this change in 2016 was $125 million  ($81 million  after-tax or $0.06  per share ). See “Pension and
Retiree Medical Plans” in “Our Critical  Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further
unaudited information on this change in accounting estimate.
In 2014, we offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment
equal to the present value of the particip ant’s pension benefit (payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or IRA). In 2014, we made a discretionary
contribution of $388 million  to fund substantially all of these payments. We recorded a pre-tax settlement charge of $141 million  ($88 million  after-tax or $0.06  per
share) in 2014 as a result of this transaction. See additional unaudited informa tion in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Table of Contents
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptio ns, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected
return on plan assets, and from changes  in our assumptions are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or
loss in accumulated other comprehensi ve loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan
liabilities, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the follow ing year based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants,
which in 2016 was approximately 11 years for pension expense and approximately 7 years for retiree medical expense. The cost or benefit of plan changes that incre ase
or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service (credit)/cost) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
active plan participants.
In 2016, we approve d an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the combination of two plans effective December 31,
2016, and the spinof f of a portion of the combined plan into a pre-existing plan effective January 1, 2017. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were
unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A, or active plan, and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan
I, or inacti ve plan. The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to
reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the active plan will continue to be amortized over the average remaining service life of the active
participants (approximately 11 years beginning in 2017), while the actuarial gains and losses associated with the inactive plan will be amortized over the remaining life
expectancy of the inactive participants (approximately 27 years beginning in 2017). As a result of these changes, benefit plan pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by
approximately $40 million  in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated.

The amounts we report as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
•Service cost is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year .
•Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
•Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit
obligations.
•Amortization of prior service (credit)/cost represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.
•Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amounts of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation
based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectivel y eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements
are trigger ed when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost.
Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations.
Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are
recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate
or an amendment is adopted).
•Special termination benefits are the additional benefits of fered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.

Fair value of plan assets $ 11,458  $ 11,397  $ 2,492  $ 406  $ 320  $ 354
(a) The increase in U.S. pensi on plans in 2016 is due to the combination of two U.S. qualified defined benefit plans as part of our plan reorganization, resulting in the accumulated benefit obligation of the combined plan
exceeding the fair value of plan assets.
Of the total projecte d pension benefit liability at year-end 2016 , $790 million  relates to plans that we do not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive
favorable tax treatment.
Future Benefit Payments and Funding
Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 - 26
Pension $ 725 $ 780 $ 825 $ 870 $ 925 $ 5,270
Retiree medical (a)$ 120 $ 120 $ 115 $ 110 $ 110 $ 485
(a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $2-$3 million  for
each of the years from 2017  through 2021  and approximately $7 million  in total for 2022 through 2026.
These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.
In 2017 , we expect to make pension and retiree medical contributions of approximately $184 million , with approximately $54 million  for retiree medical benefits.
Plan Assets
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities, an evalu ation of
market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit paym ents. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our
investment objectiv e includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Our overall investment policy is to
prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our
investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures
contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.
110
Table of Contents
For 2017  and 2016 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.5% . Our tar get investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:
 2017 2016
Fixed income 40% 40%
U.S. equity 33% 33%
International equity 22% 22%
Real estate 5% 5%
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment
allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility
and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-
term rates.  We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our marke t-related
value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or
losses (the difference between the expec ted and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-
to-year volatility .

(b)The equity securities portfolio was invested in U.S. and International common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio in the U.S. was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock
investments. The common stock is based on quoted prices in active markets. The U.S. commingled funds are based on fair values of the investments owned by these funds that are benchmarked against various U.S. large, mid-cap
and small company indices, and includes one large-cap fund that represents 19% and 18% of total U.S. plan assets for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The international commingled funds are based on the fair values of the investments
owned by these funds that track various non-U.S. equity indices. The preferred stock investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets.
(c)These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represent 22% and 23% of total U.S. plan assets
for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans, which are voluntary defined contribution plans. The plans are designed to help employees
accumulate additional savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of
service.
Certain U.S. salaried  employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution to the 401(k)
savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.
In 2016 , 2015  and 2014 , our total Company contributions were $164 million , $148 million  and $130 million , respectively .

(b) These notes were designated as a net investment hedge to partially of fset the ef fects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper , and the redemption of
certain long-term debt obligations.
In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion  to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900%  senior notes due 2018 and 5.125%  senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion
and $750 million , respectively , and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax char ge of $233 million  ($156 million  after -tax

information in “Items Af fecting Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In 2016 , we enter ed into a new five-year unsec ured revolving credit agreement (Five-Y ear Credit Agreement) which expires on June 6, 2021. The Five-Y ear Credit
Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.7225 billion , subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments
under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion . Additionally , we may , once a year , request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period.
Also in 2016 , we entered into a new 364-day unsecu red revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June 5, 2017. The 364-Day Credit
Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.7225 billion , subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments
under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion . We may request renewal of this facility  for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a
term loan for a period of up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Y ear Credit Agreement and
the 364-Day Credit Agreement togethe r replaced our $3.7225 billion  five-year  credit agreement dated as of June 8, 2015 and our $3.7225 billion  364-day credit
agreement dated as of June 8, 2015. Funds borrowed under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate
purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow , prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 31, 2016 , there were no outstanding
borrowings under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.
In addition, as of December 31, 2016 , our international debt of $235 million  was related to borrowings from external parties including various lines of credit. These
lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings.

We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal course  of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives,
global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving
opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing
agreements.
Our hedgi ng strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash
flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from
derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the
earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. See “Our Business Risks” in Management’ s
115
Table of Contents
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our business risks.
For cash flow hedge s, the effective portion of changes in fair value is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity until the
underlying hedged item is recognized in net income. For fair value hedges, changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings, consistent with the underlying
hedged item. For net investment hedges , the effective portion of the gains and losses on the debt instruments arising from the effects of foreign exchange are recorded
in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Hedging transactions are
limited to an underlying exposure. As a result, any change in the value of our hedging instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of
the underl ying hedged items. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk
regularly , including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the coun terparty .
Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consi der this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of
financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
Commodity Prices
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which
we operate . This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which include swaps and
futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms
of no more than three  years, to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products,
energy and metals. Ineffectiveness for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. Derivatives used to
hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatme nt are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in
corporate unallocate d expenses as either  cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses
are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $0.8 billion  as of December 31, 2016  and $1.0 billion  as of December 26, 2015 .
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our net revenue in 2016 , with Mexico, Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising
approximately 19% of our net revenue in 2016 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign  exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold.
Additionally , we are exposed to foreig n exchange risk from net investments  in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and
liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currenc ies with
foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years . Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign
currency transaction s are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects
of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
116
Table of Contents
Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion  as of December 31, 2016  and $2.1 billion  as of December 26, 2015 . The total notional amount
of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $0.8 billion  as of December 31, 2016 . Ineffectiveness for derivatives and non-derivatives that qualify
for hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all gains
and losses were of fset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.
Inter est Rates
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investme nt opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use
various interest rate derivative instrum ents including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to
manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instrumen ts effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of
our fixed rate indebt edness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest
rate swaps  match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related  debt. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable
interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $11.2 billion  as of December 31, 2016  and $12.5 billion  as of December 26, 2015 . Ineffectiveness for
derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented.
As of December 31, 2016 , approximately 38% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments , was subject to variable rates, compared
to approximately 33% as of December 26, 2015 .
Available-for-Sale Securities
Investments in debt and marketable equity securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are classified as available-for -sale. All highly
liquid investments with original maturiti es of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our investments in available-for -sale securities are reported at fair
value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for -sale securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within
common shareholde rs’ equity . Unrealized gains and losses on our investments  in debt securities as of December 31, 2016  were not material. The pre-tax unrealized
gains on our investments in marketable equity securities were $72 million  and $115 million  as of December 31, 2016  and December 26, 2015 , respectively .
Changes in the fair value of available-for -sale securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other -than-temporary impairment is recognized. We
regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other -than-temporarily impaired. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the
duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or
whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a security is other -than-
temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security . We recorded no other -than-
temporary impairment char ges on our available-for -sale securities for the years ended December 31, 2016  and December 26, 2015 .
Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co. Ltd.
During 2016, we concluded that the decline in estimated fair value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB was other than temporary based on significant negative
economic trends in China and changes in assumptions associated with T AB’s future financial performance arising from the disclosure by T AB’s parent company ,
117
Table of Contents
Tingyi, regarding the operating results of its beverage business. As a result, we recorded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million  ($0.26  per share ) in
2016 in the AMENA segment. This charge was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our income statement and reduced the value of our 5%
indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was derived using both an income and market approach, and is considered a non-
recurring Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy . The carrying value of the investment in TAB was $166 million  as of December 31, 2016 . We continue to
monitor the impact of economic and other developments on the remaining value of our investment in T AB.
In connection with our transaction with Tingyi in 2012, we received a call option to increase our holding in TAB to 20% with an expiration date in 2015. Prior to its
expiration, we concluded that the proba bility of exercising the option was remote and, accordingly , we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million  ($0.05  per
share) to write of f the recorded value of this call option.

Note 10 — Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Shar e
Basic net income attributable to PepsiC o per common share is net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common  shares
outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs, PSUs, PEPunits and preferre d shares
were converted into common shares.

audited PepsiCo, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issue d by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). PepsiCo, Inc.’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial report ing, and for its assessment of the effectiveness  of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’ s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express  an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conduct ed our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the consolidat ed financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluati ng the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included perfo rming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company ’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external  purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditu res of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not preven t or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of PepsiCo, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and December 26,
2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, PepsiCo, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in
Internal Control − Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

(c) Chang es in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter of

During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 , we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems
implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiati ve, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our
businesses over the course of the next few years. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design
and docum entation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. We do not expect this transition
to materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.

ARTICLE I - HIST ORY AND GENERAL INFORMA TION
The Plan came into operation on and took ef fect from September 1, 1980, and was comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture”
and the “Plan Rules”, and was later amended and restated in its entirety , effective September 2, 1982.
The Plan was further amended and restated in its entirety , effective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules” (applicable to
benefits funded by the Corporation’ s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules”
(applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they arise) took ef fect.
The Plan was further amended ef fective January 1, 2005, so that no person subject to taxation in the United States of America may in any way have their right to
a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated
Company permanently before becoming subject to U.S. taxation.
 
Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form a single governing legal document, as set forth
herein. The terms of the Plan set forth in this amended and restated governing legal document are known as the “DB Program” (also known as “PIRP-DB”). This
amended and restated governing legal document shall apply to Members who are in Membership from and after January 1, 2010, as well as any others who claim rights
from and after January 1, 2010 that are derived from current or former Membership, including former Members and the Dependants and Eligible Spouses of Members
and former Members. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the amendment and restatement of this Plan, the supersession of the prior documents by this
Plan, and the prior existence of separate Plan A and Plan B Rules shall not at any time result in any duplication of benefits (nor shall duplication of benefits result from
any other factor or circumstance related to this Plan or any prior version of this Plan).
Effective January 1, 201 1, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit selected international employees for
whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of their home countries for whom it is judged to be impracticable to have them
participate in their home country retirement plans and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The
terms of the DC Program are set forth in a separate governing legal document. Together , the DC Program and the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan.
Effective January 1, 2016, the Plan was amended and restated (the “Restatement Date”).
At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended
1
(“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive’ s individual employer . With respect to his employer , the executive has the rights of an
unsecured general creditor . The Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons
substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.

month after the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization but before the Member's Normal Retirement Date. The amount
of such Pension shall be computed in accordance with T able A as if the Member retired at his Normal Retirement Date, but on the basis of the Member ’s Highest
Average Monthly Salary (as defined in T able A) and Pensionable Service as of his employment termination date; provided, however , that, in the case of a Member
electing to receive his Pension prior to attaining his Normal Retirement Date, the amount of his Pension shall be reduced by 4/12 of 1 percent for each month by which

provided, however , that in the case of a Member who remains in the employment of the PepsiCo Or ganization or any Employer after ceasing to be an Active
Member , the amount of such Member ’s Deferred V ested Pension shall be determined in accordance with T able A by reference to (i) the Member ’s Highest
Average Monthly Salary at the date the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization (but only to the extent permitted
under Sections 9.13 and 9.14), and (ii) the Member ’s Pensionable Service as of his termination of employment date.
(c) A Member ’s Deferred V ested Pension shall commence at the later of (i) the Member ’s termination of employment with both his Employer and the
PepsiCo Or ganization, or (ii) the Member ’s Normal Retirement Date. However , a Member may elect, by filing a written election with the V ice President to have
his Deferred V ested Pension commence as of the first day of any month after the date he attains age 55 (or the date of his termination of employment with both
his Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, if later). In the case of a Member electing to receive his Deferred V ested Pension prior to attaining his Normal
Retirement Date, the amount of his Pension shall be reduced in accordance with the reduction factors applicable to early commencement of a “V ested Pension”
under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, not the percentage factors which apply to an Early and Special Early Retirement Pension as described in Sections 4.02 and
4.03.
(d) If Member becomes entitled to a Deferred V ested Pension under subsection (a) above and once again becomes an Eligible Employee, he shall be re-
admitted to Active Membership in accordance with the provisions of Article III. His Service and Pensionable Service from his earlier period as an Active
Member shall be aggregated with his subsequent period of Service and Pensionable Service for purposes of calculating his Pension upon his later retirement or
other termination of employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, but only if his Pension with respect to his earlier period of Pensionable
Service was not previously cashed out under Section 5.05.
4.05    Late Retir ement Pension.
A Member who continues employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization or any Employer after his Normal Retirement Age shall be entitled to a Late Retirement
Pension. The Member ’s Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the day the Member terminates employment
with both his Employer and the PepsiCo
11
Organization. The Member shall be credited with his Salary and Pensionable Service after his Normal Retirement Date, unless otherwise prospectively determined by
the V ice President.
4.06    Vesting.
Subject to Section 9.14 and to T able A (I)(c), a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his Pension upon completing 5 years of
Service, or if earlier , upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization. The determination of whether a Member
has become disabled for this purpose shall be made by the V ice President in accordance with such standards that the V ice President deems to be appropriate as of the
time in question.
4.07    Special V esting for Appr oved T ransfers and Status Changes.
(a) Automatic Special V esting for Approved T ransfers.  Notwithstanding Section 4.06 above, in the case of an Active Member who will have an
Approved T ransfer during a Plan Y ear, the Active Member shall automatically have special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a)
the Active Member ’s Approved T ransfer , or (b) the day the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved T ransfer .
(b) Special V esting for Status Changes . Also notwithstanding Section 4.06 above, in the case of an Active Member who will have a Status Change, the
Active Member may request that the V ice President apply special vesting to him as of the last business day before the Active Member ’s Status Change. In order
for special vesting related to a Status Change to be valid and ef fective under the DB Program, the Active Member ’s request and the V ice President’ s approval of
the request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.
Subject to the next sentence, the ef fect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b) above is that the Member will become
vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 4.06 if the Member vested under that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the
preceding provisions of this Section 4.07, rights under this Section 4.07 are subject to the overriding requirement that benefits and other rights under the Plan must
remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 4.07 shall not apply to the extent inconsistent with this
requirement.
4.08    Accruals After Benefit Commencement.
This section applies to a Member who earns Service and Pensionable Service for a period that is after his Annuity Starting Date under the preceding Sections of
this Article IV (other than an Annuity Starting Date related to a cashout distribution under Section 5.05). Any prior benefits that have been suspended, and any
additional benefits accrued by Member after his prior benefit commencement, shall be paid at his subsequent Annuity Starting Date. The suspension or
12
continuation of a Member ’s prior benefits, any adjustments to the Member ’s benefits that are payable upon his subsequent Annuity Starting Date, and the election of a
time and form of payment for benefits payable at the subsequent Annuity Starting Date, shall be subject to rules established by the V ice President for this purpose. Such
rules shall be based upon the PepsiCo Salaried Plan’ s rules for benefits accrued after the benefit commencement date of a participant in that plan, unless the V ice
President determines that a modification of those rules is appropriate.
13

eligible for the optional forms of payment described in (b), (c) and (d) below .
14
(b) Survivor Options : A married or unmarried Member who elects not to receive benefits in the normal form may elect to receive payment of his Pension
in accordance with one of the survivor options listed below . Such election shall be made on such form and during such period prior to commencement of the
Member ’s Pension as may be required by the V ice President. The Member also may designate, prior to commencement, a Dependant to receive the survivor
portion of his elected survivor option on such form as may be required by the V ice President; provided, however , that (1) the approval of the V ice President shall
be necessary if the Member designates a Dependant other than the Member ’s Eligible Spouse; and (2) if a married Member elects an option described in this
subsection (b) and names a Dependant other than his Eligible Spouse, he must submit written evidence of the Eligible Spouse’ s consent to such option and
designation of a Dependant. A Member may not change his form of benefit or Dependant after his Pension has commenced.
(1) 100 Percent Survivor Option : The Member shall receive a reduced Pension payable for his life and payments in the same reduced amount

Member who became entitled to a Pension under the Plan as in ef fect prior to January 1, 1990, the above Pension reduction may be subject to a subsidy ,
as determined by the V ice President.
(2) 75 Percent Survivor Option : The Member shall receive a reduced Pension payable for his life and payments in the amount of 75 percent of
such reduced Pension shall continue after the Member's death to his Dependant for life. Subject to subsection (f) below , the amount of the Member's
reduced Pension is determined by reducing the amount of the Member ’s Single Life Annuity benefit, determined in accordance with T able A, by 15
percent. In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension under the Plan as in ef fect prior to January 1, 1990, the above Pension reduction may
be subject to a subsidy , as determined by the V ice President.
(3) 50 Percent Survivor Option : The Member shall receive a reduced Pension payable for his life and payments in the amount of 50 percent of
such reduced Pension shall continue after the Member's death to his Dependant for life. Subject to subsection (f) below , the amount of the Member's
reduced Pension is determined by reducing the amount of the Member ’s Single Life Annuity benefit, determined in accordance with T able A, by 10
percent. In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension under the Plan as in ef fect prior to January 1, 1990, his Pension shall not be subject to
this reduction.
(4) Ten-Y ear Certain and Life Option : Subject to Section 5.04, a Member may elect to receive a reduced Pension payable monthly for his lifetime
but for not less than 120 months. If the Member dies before 120 payments have been
15
made, the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for the remainder of the 120-month period to the Member's primary Dependant (if the primary
Dependant has predeceased the Member , to the Member's contingent Dependant; and if there is no contingent Dependant, to the Member ’s estate). If
post-death payments commence to a Member ’s primary or contingent Dependant and such Dependant dies before all remaining payments due have been
made, then the remaining payments shall be paid to such Dependant’ s estate. Effective as of January 1, 2010, the Member ’s Dependant or estate (as
applicable) may elect by following the procedures set forth by the V ice President for this purpose, instead to receive a single lump sum payment that is
the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments due to such Dependant or estate (but computed without reduction for mortality), determined as of the
date on which the lump sum payment is processed by the V ice President. The amount of the Member's reduced Pension is determined by reducing the
Member's Single Life Annuity benefit, determined in accordance with T able A, by 5 percent.
(c) Lump Sum Payment : Subject to Section 5.04, a Member who elects not to receive benefits in the normal form may elect to receive payment of his
Pension in the form of a single lump sum payment. The amount of the single lump sum payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Single Life Annuity ,
determined in accordance with T able A, utilizing the lump sum equivalent factors applicable to lump sum distributions under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan
(disregarding transition factors), calculated as of the date payments would have commenced under the normal form of benefit or other optional benefit. The
lump sum payment shall be made in one taxable year of the Member and shall be paid as soon as practicable after the date specified by the Member in his
written election. Effective for lump sum payments due to be paid on or after January 1, 2010, interest will be added to late lump sum payments in accordance
with the administrative practices of the PepsiCo Salaried Plan. No interest shall be payable on such sum during any such deferred period specified by the
Member .
(d) Combination Lump Sum/Monthly Benefit : Subject to Section 5.04, a married or unmarried Member who elects not to receive his Pension in the
normal form may elect to receive payment of his Pension in the form of a combination lump sum/monthly benefit option. If elected, the Member shall receive a
portion of his benefit in the form of a lump sum payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in Sections 5.02 and
5.03. The benefit shall be divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole number percentages designated by the Member on a form provided for
this purpose. To be ef fective, the two percentages designated by the Member must add to 100 percent.
(1) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by multiplying: (A) the amount determined under Section 5.03(c) by
(B) the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of a lump sum.
16
(2) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by multiplying: (A) the amount of the monthly benefit elected
by the Member , determined in accordance with Sections 5.03(a) or (b), by (B) the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of a
monthly benefit.
(e) Death Prior to Pension Becoming Payable : If a Member who is entitled to an immediate Pension under Article IV elects an optional form of payment
under this Section 5.03, if such election meets all requirements to be ef fective (other than the Member ’s survival, but including the time for making the election
and any necessary Eligible Spouse’ s consent), and thereafter the Member dies after leaving employment but before such Pension becomes payable, then on the
first day of the month next following his death such optional form of payment shall be deemed to be in ef fect. Such deemed ef fectiveness may only apply once
and only to the initial election made by a Member (except as permitted by a decision of the V ice President that is made prior to the Member ’s submission of a
subsequent purported election). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of the option under Section 5.03(b), if the Member ’s specified Dependant has died or
shall die before the date on which the first installment of the Member ’s Pension was prospectively payable in accordance with the optional form of payment
elected by the Member , the Member ’s election of such optional form shall not be given ef fect.
(f) Reduction for Certain Y ounger Dependants : Notwithstanding the reduction factors specified in Sections 5.02(b) and 5.03, a Member electing a form
of payment that includes a survivor option shall have his Pension reduced in accordance with this subsection (f) in the event the Dependant under such survivor
option is more than 10 years younger than the Member .
(1) Not More than 20 Y ears Y ounger : In the event the Dependant is more than 10 years younger than the Member , but not more than 20 years
younger , the percentage reduction that otherwise would apply shall be increased by 5 percentage points.
(2) More than 20 Y ears Y ounger : In the event the Dependant is more than 20 years younger than the Member , the 5 percentage point increase in
the reduction provided in (1) above shall be further increased by an additional 0.2 percent for each full year over 20.
5.04    Applicability of Certain Options.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article V , the availability of certain distribution options shall be restricted in accordance with the terms of this
Section 5.04.
(a) Pre-1990 Distributions : The form of payment described in Section 5.03(d) above shall not be available unless the Member's Annuity Starting Date is
after 1989.
17
(b) Deferred V ested Pensions : Deferred V ested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall be eligible for payment only under the Single Life Annuity , the 50
Percent Survivor Option or the 75 Percent Survivor Option, except as provided in the next sentence. Effective as of January 1, 2015, Deferred V ested Pensions
under Section 4.04 shall also be eligible for the Lump Sum Payment option, but only to the limited extent that such option is available on an on-going basis with
respect to deferred vested pensions under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan (except that unlike participants in the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, participants in this Plan with a
benefit under the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan shall not be excluded from the Lump Sum Payment option).
(c) Simplified Actuarial Factors : In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension prior to January 1, 1990, the actuarial equivalencies
described in the preceding provisions of this Article V shall be adjusted as provided by the V ice President from time to time to reflect the value of any
subsidized survivor benefit to which the Member is entitled under the last sentence of Section 5.02(b) (regarding the availability on favorable terms of the
survivor benefit described in Section 5.02(b)).
5.05    Cashout of Small Benefits.
Where the total Pension payable to any person under the DB Program is, in the opinion of the V ice President, of an amount that is relatively trivial (when
considered by itself or in relation to the potential administrative burden of continuing to keep track of such Pension under the DB Program), he may commute the whole
of such Pension to a lump sum payable following (i) the relevant Member ’s termination of employment from both his Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, or (ii) a
Member ’s transfer within the PepsiCo Or ganization that results in the Member ceasing to actively accrue all benefits under the DB Program, on a date determined in the
discretion of the V ice President, without the consent of the Member .
5.06    Designation of Dependant.
A Member who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a Dependant who will be
entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the ef fective date of his
election. If the Member is married at the time he designates a Dependant, any designation under this section of a Dependant who is not the Member ’s Eligible Spouse
shall require the written consent of the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a Dependant does not require consent by the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. The
designation of any Dependant, and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a Member ’s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in
accordance with rules adopted by the V ice President, shall be made in writing on forms provided by the V ice President, and shall not be ef fective unless and until filed
with the V ice President. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 5.03(b)(4), the following shall apply: (i) the Member shall be entitled to name both a
primary Dependant and a contingent Dependant, and (ii) if no Dependant is properly designated, then a Member ’s election of such option will not be given ef fect.
18
ARTICLE VI - DEA TH BENEFITS
The surviving Eligible Spouse of a Member who dies shall be entitled to certain survivor benefits if the requirements of this Article VI are satisfied. The amount
of any such benefit shall be determined in accordance with Section II of T able A.
6.01    Active and Retir ement-Eligible Members.
In the event of the death of a married Active Member or a married Member in Service after his Normal Retirement Date, who had at his death completed at least
5 years of Service, or of a Member entitled to an Early Retirement Pension under Section 4.02 or a Special Early Retirement Pension under Section 4.03, and who is not
entitled at the time of his death to the protection provided by Section 5.03(e), there shall be a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable to the Member ’s surviving
Eligible Spouse, if any , calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section II of T able A.
6.02    Deferr ed V ested Members.
In the event of the death of a married Member who is entitled to a Deferred V ested Pension under Section 4.04 and who is not entitled at the time of his death to
the protections provided by Section 5.03(e), there shall be payable a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, which shall be calculated based on the Member ’s Salary and
Pensionable Service at the time of the Member ’s termination of employment date. The benefit shall be calculated as if the Member lived until the earliest date the
Member ’s vested benefit could have started, after having elected to start his benefit at that time in the form of a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity , and died that same day .
Coverage for this Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension shall be paid for with a reduction to the monthly benefit otherwise payable to the Member . The reduction
charged to the Member ’s benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology , and based on the same factors, provided for under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan,
as in ef fect from time to time. The Member may only waive this Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension coverage with the approval of the V ice President.
6.03    Form and T ime of Payment of Death Benefits.
(a) Form of Payment:  Any Pension payable pursuant to this Article VI shall be payable for the surviving Eligible Spouse’ s life only; however , in the case
of a Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse where the Member was eligible for a Normal, Early or Special Early Retirement Pension at death, the
Eligible Spouse may elect to receive the Pension in the form of a single lump sum payment in lieu of the annuity payment.
19
(b) Time of Payment:  Subject to Section 6.04, any Pension payable to the Eligible Spouse under this Article VI shall commence on the first day of the
month coinciding with or next following the Member ’s death, or if later , the date on which the Member would have attained age 55. In the event a Pension
payable to a Member ’s Eligible Spouse commences before the Member would have reached Normal Retirement Age, the benefit will be reduced as set forth in
Section 4.02, 4.03 or 4.04, as applicable based on the Pension to which the Member was entitled, to reflect early commencement.
6.04    Disposition of Death Benefits.
Any benefit expressed to be subject to disposition in accordance with the provision of this Article VI shall be held by the V ice President with power to pay or
apply the same to or for the benefit of such one or more of the Member ’s Dependants, as the V ice President shall think fit and if more than one in such shares as they
shall likewise think fit. Notwithstanding any other provision of the DC Program, the V ice President may direct that such benefit shall commence or be paid in a lump
sum as soon as practicable after the Member ’s date of death.
20
ARTICLE VII - ADMINISTRA TION
7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.
(a) Administration by the V ice President:  The Plan shall be administered by the V ice President, who shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and
issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the V ice President hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations,
determinations and regulations made or issued by the V ice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.
(b) Authority to Delegate:  The V ice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other persons or entities, or designate or employ
other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the V ice President shall,
to the extent applicable, refer to such action by the V ice President’ s delegate or other designated person.
7.02    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the opinion of the V ice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability
or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the V ice President may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person’ s
legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment be applied for the benefit of such person in such manner as the V ice President considers advisable. Any payment
of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making of such payment under
the provisions of the Plan.
7.03    Claims Pr ocedur e.
The V ice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to
determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the V ice
President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case
where the extent of this discretion is in question, the V ice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority
shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of discretion standard). If, pursuant to this
discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Member or Dependant (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the V ice President,
or a party designated by the V ice President, will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the V ice President, a
comprehensible written notice setting forth:
21
(1) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(2) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(3) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such
material or information is necessary; and
(4) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).
If the V ice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may extend the response period from 90 to
180 days. If this occurs, the V ice President will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the
extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. Upon review , the V ice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review
of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the V ice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the V ice
President’ s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial
determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to
exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special
circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is
based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of char ge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her
claim for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the V ice President
at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section.
7.04    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Member , Dependant or any
other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the
Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to
accrue not later than earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii) the date identified
to the Petitioner by the V ice President on which payments shall commence; or (ii) when he has actual
22
or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a
Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals
process described above shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
7.05    Restriction of V enue.
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall only be brought or filed in the state or
federal courts of New Y ork, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies, located nearest the Corporation’ s headquarters.
7.06    Effect of Specific Refer ences.
Specific references in the Plan to the Vice President’ s discretion shall create no inference that the Vice President’ s discretion in any other respect, or in connect ion with
any other provision, is less complete or broad.
23
ARTICLE VIII - AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
8.01    Continuation of the Plan.
While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely , it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance. The Corporation hereby reserves the
right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall adversely
affect the amount of benefit to which a Member or his Dependant is entitled under the Plan on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the Member becomes
entitled to an amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the Corporation. Specific forms of payment are not protected under the preceding
sentence.
8.02    Amendment.
The Corporation may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to the Plan from time to time, with or without retroactive ef fect, subject to
Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the Plan.
8.03    Termination.
The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers. If the Plan is terminated with respect
to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in ef fect for the benefit of the employees of the remaining Employers.
24
ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS
9.01    Unfunded Plan.
The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable when due out of the Employer ’s general
funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured
general creditor of the Employer .
9.02    Costs of the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, char ges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and management of the Plan shall be the costs,
charges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to
the total number of Members at the time the cost or expense is incurred.
9.03    Temporary Absence of Member .
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, dischar ge, retirement or quitting ( e.g., sickness, accident, layof f, vacation), he shall be deemed to
have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is absent, unless the V ice President determines otherwise. If the Member ’s
absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-time member of the armed forces of any country or of any or ganization engaged in national service of any such
country , he shall not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he shall resign
permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur .
9.04    Taxes, Etc.
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the V ice President to be owing in respect of any benefit payable from the Plan, the Plan shall
be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in
satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty .
9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as a right of any such employee to
continue in the employment of the Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to dischar ge any of its employees, with or without cause.
25
9.06    No Right to Benefits.
No person, whether or not being a Member , shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by the terms of the Plan. In the event of a
Member ’s termination of employment by an Employer , the resulting cessation of his Active Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in
damages in any action brought against the Employer or any member of the PepsiCo Or ganization with respect to such termination.
9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.
 
All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand char ged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all sums in respect of losses to a member
of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or
Employer of proof satisfactory to the V ice President that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member . The relevant amount shall be deductible from the
Member ’s benefits and be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Or ganization whose receipt shall be a valid dischar ge for the same.
Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not exceed the exact amount of payments
that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable,
and the person to whom they are payable. Accordingly , any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more
of which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored promptly to the Plan. In exchange for
Member or Dependant status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess
Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –
(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or indirectly from the Plan and that is, in
whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the
proceeds or substitutes for such payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a person,
trust fund or entity).
(2)    The right to of fset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest) other payments that are properly payable
by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however , reliance on this right is in the discretion of the V ice President, and the existence of an
opportunity to apply it shall not diminish the Plan’ s rights under paragraph (1) above.
(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of any rights in this Section in any
court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of an
26
Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may correspond to such party’ s present or future
residence.
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the V ice President that are in furtherance of the Plan’ s recovery of the
Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict
the rights of the Plan in any way , including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.
9.08    Termination for Cause; Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the V ice President determines that a Member has been terminated for cause or
engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of the date his or her employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization terminates, the
Member shall forfeit his Pension (whether paid previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his or her Pension shall be adjusted to reflect such
forfeiture and any previously paid Pension payments shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member agrees to this, and each
Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Member shall constitute Prohibited Misconduct:
(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any ownership interest, which involves the
Member ’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below),
unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Member , directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member ’s recommendation, suggestion, identification or
advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .
(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo Or ganization other than as necessary in his or
her position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of
his or her positions with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo
Organization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and
pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
27
(4) The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s best interests, including violating the
Corporation’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained
as a result of his or her employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from communicating with government authorities
concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation, participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for
providing information to government authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information
appropriately protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any
federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government of ficial, either
directly or indirectly , or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or
other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for
reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,
if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer, employee, consultant or contractor with
respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or
testimonial on behalf of such a business entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product

Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be suf ficiently given to or served upon the Plan if it is in
writing and delivered to
28
the V ice President. In any case where under the Plan any notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be suf ficient if such notice is delivered to the
Member ’s last known address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method ( e.g., electronically) that the V ice
President determines is reasonably available to the Member .
9.10    Plan Documentation.

methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
9.12    Governing Law .
The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New Y ork.
9.13    Exemption fr om ERISA.
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as a plan maintained outside of the
United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA,
both Active Membership in the Plan and the opportunity to increase Highest A verage Monthly Earnings after ceasing to be an Active Member , in accordance with
Section 4.04(b), shall be limited to individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States, and it is
intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location that is outside of the United States.
9.14    Exemption fr om Section 409A.
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section 409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the
special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, ef fective for any period to which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a
U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively , a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their
compensation or service while a U.S. Person. Accordingly , no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is
determined, following the close of such year , that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such
29
year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar year a Member ’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the V ice President may authorize a
Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the V ice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S.
Person for such year . In other cases, the Member ’s benefit will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of
commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to the Member ’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in
such calendar year of commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that benefits and
any other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A , and the V ice President shall have such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure
that it is applied in accordance with this requirement.

TABLE A - CALCULA TION OF PENSIONS
This section sets forth the formulas for calculating the Pension payable to a Member under Article IV or the Death Benefit payable to a Member ’s Eligible
Spouse under Article VI. Any benefits accrued under the DB Program by a Member while a part-time employee, following such Member ’s designation by the V ice
President as an Eligible Employee pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.01(g), shall be prorated as determined by the V ice President to reflect the approximate ratio
of the Member ’s level of services during such part-time status to the level required for full-time status at the Member ’s work location.
(I)    Member ’s Pension
(a)    The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date for Members who became members of the Plan before
January 1, 1976 shall be the larger of the Pension calculated under this paragraph (a) or under paragraph (b) below . The Pension under this paragraph (a) shall be the
greater  of (1) or (2) below:
(1)    1.5 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the number of years of Pensionable Service; or
(2)    3 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary , multiplied by the number of years of his Pensionable Service but not exceeding 15
years.
(b)    The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date (i) for Members who became members of the Plan on or
after January 1, 1976, and (ii) for persons (other than those in (i)) who became Members on or after September 1, 1980, and (iii) for persons (other than in (i) or (ii))
who became Members after November 12, 1998, shall be the Pension calculated under this paragraph (b). The pension calculated under this paragraph (b) shall be the
aggregate of:
(1)    For up to the first 10 years of Pensionable Service, the product of (i) 3 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary , multiplied by (ii)
the number of years of Pensionable Service, but not exceeding 10 such years; plus
(2)    For any years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10, the product of (i) 1 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary , multiplied by
(ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10.
(c)    At the discretion of the V ice President, the Pension calculated as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be reduced by some or all of the following:
(1)    All state pension and social security benefits receivable by the Member attributable to Service other than those derived from unmatched and
unreimbursed voluntary contributions made by the Member;
32
(2)    The annuity equivalent of a like portion of all capital sum benefits receivable by the Member on or by reason of his retirement either from a state
source or from the Employer in consequence of a requirement of local legislation, including, but not limited to, termination indemnities;
(3)    Any benefits payable to the Member (or in respect of him) from other retirement benefit plans (or cash allowance received in lieu of Employer
contributions to a retirement benefit plan) of the Employers in respect of any period of employment which qualifies as Pensionable Service both under the DB
Program and under such other retirement benefit plans of the Employers;
(4)    Any other payment made by the Employer at the time of termination of the Member that arises from any severance agreement made between the
Employer and Member , for whatsoever reason;
(5)    The value (as determined in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President) of any benefits paid to the Member prior to his
retirement from any plan in respect of any period of employment which qualifies as Pensionable Service both under the DB Program and under such other
retirement benefit plans of the Employers;
(6)    Any deductions, reductions or forfeiture of a Member's benefits resulting from a Member's misdemeanor , misconduct or dischar ge for cause
pursuant to Section 9.08 hereof.
No such deduction shall be made in respect of any such benefits as are derived from unmatched and unreimbursed voluntary contributions made by the Member .
The value of all such deductions shall be subject to adjustment to reflect the form and timing of payment. All deductions set out in this paragraph (c) shall be calculated
as of the Member ’s termination date and in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
(d)    If the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Member is reduced under paragraph (c) above, an alternative calculation of the Pension for such Member shall
apply unless the V ice President determines that the alternative calculation would be unnecessary or impractical or would not serve the purposes of the DB Program.
Under this alternative calculation, only the Member ’s Pensionable Service under this DB Program, which does not include any employment that is taken into account in
determining benefits under paragraph (c)(1) - (5), shall be considered, and the reductions under paragraph (c)(1) - (5) shall be disregarded (however , the reduction under
paragraph (c)(6) shall be taken into account). If this alternative calculation applies, the Pension payable under this alternative calculation shall be compared to the
Pension payable under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, and whichever provides the greater Pension amount will be payable to or on behalf of the Member , subject to
the remaining provisions of this paragraph (d). The alternative calculation set forth in this paragraph (d) is intended to provide a calculation methodology that replicates
the ef fect of the “extended wearaway” calculation methodology , as it is in ef fect from time to time under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan.
33
Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this paragraph (d), any benefit increase provided as a result of this paragraph (d) will be limited so that in the judgment of the
Vice President it is not in excess of what should be available given the intent described in the preceding sentence.
(e)    For purposes of this T able A, "Highest A verage Monthly Salary" means one twelfth of the yearly average of the Member ’s Salary over any 5 consecutive
calendar years of Service in which such Salary was highest (or over such lesser period as the Member has been in Service). For purposes of determining a Member's
Highest A verage Monthly Salary , the following shall apply:
(1)    A calendar year with no Salary shall be disregarded, and the calendar years preceding and following such calendar year (or years) shall be
considered consecutive.
(2)    If in a calendar year there is an unpaid authorised leave of absence, or other absence from paid service, that results in less than a complete year of
Salary , such calendar year shall be disregarded and the next preceding or succeeding year or years shall be taken into account if it results in a higher average.
(f)    In determining the amount of a Deferred V ested Pension for the purposes of Section 4.04, the Pension shall be equal to the greatest of the amounts
determined under subsection (1), (2) or (3) below:
(1)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have earned had he remained an Active
Member until his Normal Retirement Age (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and Highest A verage Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and the
denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Age.
(2)    The aggregate of:
(i)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have earned had he remained an
Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and Highest A verage Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service
he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date; and
(ii)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have earned had he remained an
Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and the Highest A verage Monthly
34
Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service
after September 30, 2003 and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member
until his Normal Retirement Date.
(3)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have earned had he remained an Active
Member until his Normal Retirement Date  and the Highest A verage Monthly Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service, reduced by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have
earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date.
For Members who became Members of the Plan before January 1, 1976, the Deferred V ested Pension shall be the larger of 1½ percent of the Member ’s
Highest A verage Monthly Salary multiplied by the Member ’s number of years of Pensionable Service at termination or the amount determined by the V ice
President based on actuarial information provided to the V ice President.
All deductions set out in (c) above that are applicable to a Member entitled to a Deferred V ested Pension shall be calculated as of the time such Member ceases
to be in Service and in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President.
(II)    Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension
Effective for deaths before July 1, 2010, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01 shall be equal to 25 percent of
the Pension, payable as a Single Life Annuity , to which the Member would have been entitled at his Normal Retirement Date, calculated as in Part I above as if the
Member had remained an Active Member until age 65 without change in his Highest A verage Monthly Salary . In computing the Member ’s Pension for this purpose the
Member's Pension shall be reduced to reflect any benefits which would have been taken into account under Part I above had the Member retired on the date of death,
but shall not reduce the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension to reflect commencement prior to the date the Member would have attained Normal Retirement Age.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, if a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies after the date he would have been entitled to retire early under
Section 4.02, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension payable to such spouse shall not be less than 50 percent of the Pension to which the Member would have been
entitled if he had retired on the day preceding his death and shall be reduced in accordance with Section 4.02 if the spouse commences the Pre-Retirement Souse’ s
Pension prior to the date the Member would have attained age 62.

ii
ARTICLE I – HIST ORY AND GENERAL INFORMA TION
PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Corporation”) first established the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan ef fective as of September 1, 1980. The Plan at that time was
comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules.” The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety , effective September
2, 1982.
The Plan was again amended and restated ef fective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the
Corporation’ s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded
by the Corporation as they arise) took ef fect.
The Plan was further amended ef fective January 1, 2005, to provide that no person subject to taxation in the United States of America may in any way have their
right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any
Associated Company permanently before becoming subject to U.S. taxation.
 
Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form one Plan document. The amendment and
restatement referred to in the prior sentence remains in ef fect, and it sets forth the terms of the “DB Program.”
Effective January 1, 201 1, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit selected international employees for
whom it has been determined to be appropriate ( i.e., employees on assignments outside of their home countries for whom it is judged to be impractical to have them
participate in their home country retirement plans, and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The
terms of the DC Program are set forth in this document, which is the governing legal document for the DC Program. Together , the DC Program and the DB Program set
forth the terms of a single Plan. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to in employee communications as the PepsiCo International Pension Plan or “PIPP .”
Effective January 1, 2016, the DC Program was amended and restated. As part of the amendment and restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to
also benefit selected employees: (i) who are localized to a country outside of their home country , (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution
retirement program sponsored immediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement program is available.
At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive’ s individual
1
employer . With respect to his employer , the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor . The Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan
maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.

but for his part-time status, otherwise satisfies the requirements of this subsection.
(j) “Eligible Spouse ” means the individual to whom the Member is married, or to whom the Member was married on the date of his death. The
determination of whether a

rate of interest on 30-year T reasury securities as prescribed by the Commissioner of the United States Internal Revenue Service for the month of September
immediately preceding the first day of the Plan Y ear to which an Interest Credit relates. The V ice President shall have the discretion to change from time to time
the basis for determining the Interest Rate as necessary to ensure that the Interest Rate is readily determinable and administrable, and that it can be reasonably

special V aluation Date prior to the end of a Plan Y ear for Active Members who have an Approved T ransfer (and for certain Active Members who have a Status
Change) as described in Section 4.02. In accordance with procedures that may be adopted by the V ice President, any current V aluation Date may be changed
(but in such case adjustments shall apply in the operation of the DC Program as necessary to prevent duplicate or disproportionate benefits, as determined by the
Vice President). Values are determined as of the close of a V aluation Date or , if such date is not a business day , as of the close of the preceding business day .
(z) “Vice President ” means the V ice President, Global Benefits & W ellness of PepsiCo, Inc., but if such position is vacant or eliminated it shall be the

includes 29th February) shall be deemed to constitute a year , but not so that in the calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where
the amount of a benefit depends upon the calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months,
a proportionate amount ( i.e., a number of days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be included in the calculation.  Where
this document makes reference to months or parts of a year , or to any other period of time except a day , week or year the V ice President may authorize the
period to be counted in days or complete calendar months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year .
(c) Compounds of the W ord “Here”:  The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the
entire DC Program, not to any particular provision or section.     
(d) Examples:  Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a
similar ef fect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to
such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of application).
(e) Subdivisions of this Document:  This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point.

ARTICLE III – MEMBERSHIP
3.01    Eligibility for Membership.
Every person who the V ice President determines is an Eligible Employee shall be eligible for Membership.
3.02    Admission to Membership.
Every person who the V ice President determines is an Eligible Employee, and who is not during the relevant time a U.S. Person, shall, following the approval of
his Membership by the V ice President, be admitted to Membership ef fective as of his Entry Date. For this purpose, the relevant time includes a suf ficient period before
the Eligible Employee’ s Proposed Entry Date as is necessary to avoid PIRP-DC Accounts being considered deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of
the United States Internal Revenue Code. No Eligible Employee or any other person shall be admitted to Membership without the approval of the V ice President.
3.03    Active and Inactive Membership.
A Member shall be an Active Member during the period that he is – (a) employed as an Eligible Employee, (b) not a U.S. Person, and (c) currently approved for
status as an Active Member by the V ice President. A Member shall be an Inactive Member during any period that he does not currently meet all of the requirements to
be an Active Member .
9
ARTICLE IV – CONTRIBUTIONS
4.01    Contributions.
To the extent provided in subsections (a) and (b) below , the Employer shall allocate Pay Credits and Interest Credits to a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account, each
determined by the V ice President as follows –
(a) Pay Credit . To receive a Pay Credit for a Plan Y ear, an individual must be an Active Member during such year . The amount of an Active Member ’s
Pay Credit for a Plan Y ear shall be determined by multiplying the Active Member ’s annualized Salary in ef fect as of that year ’s Valuation Date by the Active
Member ’s applicable percentage, which shall be one of the following: 5%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 18%. The V ice President shall specify the Active Member ’s
applicable percentage as of the Active Member ’s Entry Date. For each subsequent Plan Y ear that the individual is an Active Member , the V ice President may
specify a new applicable percentage that shall apply to the Active Member for such Plan Y ear.
(b) Interest Credit . To receive an Interest Credit for a Plan Y ear, an individual must be either an Active Member or Inactive Member during such year ,
and the individual must have had a balance in his PIRP-DC Account as of the prior Plan Y ear’s Valuation Date. The amount of a Member ’s Interest Credit shall
be determined by the V ice President by multiplying the Interest Rate for the period since the last V aluation Date by the balance of the Member ’s PIRP-DC
Account as of such last V aluation Date.
A Member ’s Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined by the V ice President as soon as administratively practicable after each V aluation Date. If a Member has
less than one full year of Active Membership since such last V aluation Date ( e.g., as may apply in the Member ’s first and last year of Membership), the Member ’s Pay
Credit as otherwise determined under subsection (a) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member ’s fractional year of Active Membership. If a
Member has less than one full year of Membership since such last V aluation Date, any Interest Credit as otherwise available and determined under subsection (b) above
shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member ’s fractional year of Membership ( e.g., as may apply in the Member ’s last year of Membership). A fractional
year shall be computed by dividing the Member ’s days of Membership or Active Membership (as applicable) during the Plan Y ear by the total number of days in such
Plan Y ear. A period of paid leave of absence during a Plan Y ear shall be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member ’s Pay Credit
for the Plan Y ear in accordance with the prior sentence. However , a period of unpaid leave of absence during a Plan Y ear shall not be considered a period of Active
Membership for purposes of determining a Member ’s Pay Credit for the Plan Y ear in accordance with the prior sentence (and as a result, the Pay Credit for the Plan
Year containing the unpaid leave shall be prorated, or there shall be no Pay Credit, all as necessary to limit Pay Credits to the Member ’s period of Active Membership
during the Plan Y ear). In the event a prorated Pay Credit and Interest Credit relate to the Member ’s final year of Membership, the Pay
10
Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined as of the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date (with proration based upon the Member ’s fractional final year of
Membership). The calculation of the Pay Credit and Interest Credit by the V ice President shall be conclusive and binding on all Members (and their Dependants).
4.02    Offsets.
Notwithstanding Section 4.01, the Corporation may reduce the amount of any payment or benefit that is or would become payable to or on behalf of a Member
by the amount of any obligation of the Member to the Corporation or by the amount of –
(a) Any material benefits accrued by the Member under a retirement plan sponsored by the Corporation or by any country , state, province or other
political subdivision or locality , to the extent the V ice President determines that the benefit amount under such retirement plan is for Service or Salary that is
taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC Program, and
(b) Any termination indemnity or other payment to the Member by the Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization related to the Member ’s termination of
employment, to the extent the V ice President determines that the payment is reasonably related to Service that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits
under the DC Program.
Consistent with the foregoing, appropriate reductions may be made in the Pay Credits and Interest Credits that otherwise would be provided to the Member under
Sections 4.01 and 4.02, the balance in the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account under Article V , or the Member ’s distributions under Article VI. The determination of whether
a benefit is material and all other aspects of the application of this Section 4.02 is solely in the independent discretion of the V ice President.
11
ARTICLE V – MEMBER ACCOUNTS
5.01    Accounting for Members’ Inter ests.
Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be credited to a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account as of the V aluation Date to which such credits relate (or , in the case of Pay
Credits and Interest Credits that relate to the Member ’s final year of Membership, as of the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date) or as soon as administratively
practicable thereafter . A Member ’s PIRP-DC Account is a bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Member ’s Pay Credits and Interest Credits (and his
Employer ’s liability for such credits). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any PIRP-DC Account, and no PIRP-DC Account shall be funded,
insured or otherwise secured.
5.02    Vesting.
Subject to Sections 4.02 and 9.14, a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his PIRP-DC Account upon completing 3 years of
Service, or if earlier , upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization. The determination of whether a Member
has become disabled for this purpose shall be made by the V ice President in accordance with such standards as the V ice President deems to be appropriate as of the time
in question.
5.03    Special V esting for Appr oved T ransfers and Status Changes.
(a) Automatic Special V esting for Approved T ransfers.  Notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active Member who will have an
Approved T ransfer during a Plan Y ear, the Active Member shall automatically have special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a)
the Active Member ’s Approved T ransfer , or (b) the day the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved T ransfer .
(b) Special V esting for Status Changes . Also notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active Member who will have a Status Change, the
Active Member may request that the V ice President apply special vesting to him as of the last business day before the Active Member ’s Status Change. In order
for special vesting related to a Status Change to be valid and ef fective under the DC Program, the Active Member ’s request and the V ice President’ s approval of
the request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.
Subject to the next sentence, the ef fect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b) above is that the Member will become
vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 5.02 if the Member vested under that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the
preceding provisions of this Section 5.03, rights under this Section 5.03 are subject to the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and
12
other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 5.03 shall not apply to the
extent inconsistent with this requirement.
13
ARTICLE VI – DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS
6.01    Distribution Rules Generally .
A Member ’s PIRP-DC Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of the Member ’s termination of employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization or
death, as provided in Sections 6.02 and 6.03 respectively , subject to Section 4.06 (vesting). All distributions shall be made in cash.
6.02    Distributions Upon T ermination of Employment.
If a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his termination of employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization, such distribution shall be
made in a single lump sum payment on the first of the month that immediately follows the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date. In the case of a Member whose
termination of employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization occurs as a result of the Member becoming disabled, for purposes of this Section, the determination of
whether such Member is disabled and the date on which such Member ’s termination of employment is considered to occur shall be made by the V ice President.
6.03    Distributions Upon Death.
If a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his death, such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first day of
the month that immediately follows the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date. Amounts paid following a Member ’s death shall be paid to the Member ’s Dependant;
provided, however , that if no Dependant designation is in ef fect at the time of the Member ’s death (as determined by the V ice President), or if all persons designated as
Dependants have predeceased the Member , then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed to the Member ’s Eligible Spouse, or if the
Member is not married at the time of his death, to his estate.
6.04    Valuation.
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account shall continue to be credited with Interest
Credits (and debited for expenses) as specified in Article V until the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date.
6.05    Designation of Dependant.
A Member shall designate one or more Dependants who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member shall have the right to change or
revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the ef fective date of such election. If the Member is married at the time he or she designates a Dependant(s), any
designation under this section of a Dependant(s) who is not the Member ’s Eligible Spouse shall require the written consent of the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. A
revocation of a Dependant(s) does not require consent by the Member ’s
14
Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant(s), and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a Member ’s Eligible Spouse required by this
Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the V ice President, shall be made in writing on forms provided by the V ice President, and shall not be
effective unless and until filed with the V ice President.

ARTICLE VII – ADMINISTRA TION
7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.
(a) Administration by the V ice President:  The Plan shall be administered by the V ice President, who shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and
issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the V ice President hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations,
determinations and regulations made or issued by the V ice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.
(b) Authority to Delegate:  The V ice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other persons or entities, or designate or employ
other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the V ice President shall,
to the extent applicable, refer to such action by the V ice President’ s delegate or other designated person.
7.02    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the opinion of the V ice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in
any way so as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the V ice President may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person’ s legal representative for
his benefit, or that the payment be applied for the benefit of such person in such manner as the V ice President considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit in
accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.
7.03    Claims Pr ocedur e.
The V ice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to
determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the V ice
President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case
where the extent of this discretion is in question, the V ice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority
shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of discretion standard). If, pursuant to this
discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Member or Dependant (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the V ice President,
or a party designated by the V ice President, will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the V ice President, a
comprehensible written notice setting forth:
16
(a) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such
material or information is necessary; and
(d) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).
If the V ice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may extend the response period from 90 to
180 days. If this occurs, the V ice President will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the
extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. Upon review , the V ice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review
of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the V ice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the V ice
President’ s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial
determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to
exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special
circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is
based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of char ge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his claim
for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the V ice President
at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section.
7.04    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Member , Dependant or any
other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the
Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to
accrue not later than earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii) the date identified
to the Petitioner by the V ice President on which payment shall be made; or (ii) when he has actual or
17
constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a
Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals
process described above shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
7.05    Restriction of V enue.
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall only be brought or filed in the state or
federal courts of New Y ork, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies, located nearest the Corporation’ s headquarters.
7.06    Effect of Specific Refer ences.
Specific references in the Plan to the V ice President’ s discretion shall create no inference that the V ice President’ s discretion in any other respect, or in
connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
18
ARTICLE VIII – AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
8.01    Continuation of the Plan.
While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely , it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance. The Corporation hereby reserves the
right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the
balance (determined as of the date of such amendment or termination) in the Plan account maintained for the benefit of a Member or his Dependant, except to the extent
the Member becomes entitled to an amount under another plan or practice maintained by an Employer . Specific forms (including times) of payment are not protected
under the preceding sentence.
8.02    Amendment.
The Corporation may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to this Plan from time to time, with or without retroactive ef fect, subject to
Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the Plan.
8.03    Termination.
The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers. If the Plan is terminated with respect
to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in ef fect for the benefit of the employees of the remaining Employers.
19
ARTICLE IX – MISCELLANEOUS
9.01    Unfunded Plan.
The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable when due out of the Employer ’s general
funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured
general creditor of the Employer .
9.02    Costs of the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, char ges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and management of the Plan shall be the costs,
charges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to
the total number of Members at the time the cost or expense is incurred.
9.03    Temporary Absence of Member .
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, dischar ge, retirement or quitting ( e.g., sickness, accident, layof f, vacation), he shall be deemed to
have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is absent, unless the V ice President determines otherwise. If the Member ’s
absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-time member of the armed forces of any country or of any or ganization engaged in national service of any such
country , he shall not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he shall resign
permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur .
9.04    Taxes, Etc.
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the V ice President to be owing in respect of any benefit payable from the Plan, the Plan shall
be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in
satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty .
9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as a right of any such employee to
continue in the employment of the Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to dischar ge any of its employees, with or without cause.
9.06    No Right to Benefits.
No person, whether or not being a Member , shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by the terms of the Plan. In the event of a
Member ’s termination of employment by an Employer , the resulting cessation of his Membership shall not be grounds for
20
any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any member of the PepsiCo Or ganization with respect to such termination.
9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.
 
All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand char ged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all sums in respect of losses to a member
of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or
Employer of proof satisfactory to the V ice President that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member . The relevant amount shall be deductible from the
Member ’s benefits and be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Or ganization whose receipt shall be a valid dischar ge for the same.
Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not exceed the exact amount of payments
that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable,
and the person to whom they are payable. Accordingly , any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more
of which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored promptly to the Plan. In exchange for
Member or Dependant status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess
Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –
(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or indirectly from the Plan and that is, in
whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the
proceeds or substitutes for such payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a person,
trust fund or entity).
(2)    The right to of fset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest) other payments that are properly payable
by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however , reliance on this right is in the discretion of the V ice President, and the existence of an
opportunity to apply it shall not diminish the Plan’ s rights under paragraph (1) above.
(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of any rights in this Section in any
court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of an Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction,
waiving any and all rights that may correspond to such party’ s present or future residence.
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the V ice President that are in furtherance of the Plan’ s recovery of the
Excess Payment with
21
appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in
any way , including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.
9.08    Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the V ice President determines that a Member has engaged in Prohibited
Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his termination of employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization, the Member shall forfeit all Pay
Credits and Interest Credits (whether paid previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his PIRP-DC Account shall be adjusted to reflect such
forfeiture and previously paid Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member agrees to this and
each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Member shall constitute Prohibited Misconduct:
(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any ownership interest, which involves the

(2) The Member , directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member ’s recommendation, suggestion, identification or
advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .

position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his

customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its
processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.

Corporation’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the
22

other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.

other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for
reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,
if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer, employee, consultant or contractor with
respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or

9.09    Notices.
Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be suf ficiently given to or served upon the Plan if it is in
writing and delivered to the V ice President. In any case where under the Plan any notice shall be required to be given to
23
Members, it shall be suf ficient if such notice is delivered to the Member ’s last known address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member
pursuant to any other method ( e.g., electronically) that the V ice President determines is reasonably available to the Member .
9.10    Plan Documentation.
Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the Plan.
9.11    Curr ency of Payment.
Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency ," as approved by the V ice President. The amount otherwise

time to time.
9.12    Governing Law .
The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New Y ork.
9.13    Exemption fr om ERISA.
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as a plan maintained outside of the
United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA,
Active Membership in the Plan shall be limited to individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United
States, and it is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location that is outside of the United
States.
9.14    Exemption fr om Section 409A.
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section 409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the
special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, ef fective for any period to which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a
U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively , a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their
compensation or service while a U.S. Person. However , Interest Credits may be provided on the PIRP-DC Account of a Member who is a U.S. Person, but only to the
extent the balance in the PIRP-DC Account is derived from Pay Credits that relate to Service completed while the Member was not a U.S. Person (and Interest Credits
on such Pay Credits). Accordingly , no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined, following the
close of such year , that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year . Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar
24
year a Member ’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the V ice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit
commencement to the extent the V ice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year . In other cases, the Member ’s benefit
will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to the
Member ’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all
times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from
Section 409A , and the V ice President shall have such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
ARTICLE I  
Foreword
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the benefit of salaried employees of the
PepsiCo Organization who participate in the PepsiCo Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible
employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In
addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B thereof).
1989 Restatement . The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989.
409A Program Document 2005 Restatement . The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety ef fective as of January 1, 2005. The
2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally , benefits that are earned
or vested after December 31, 2004 or materially modified within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”).
Amendments to the 2005 Restatement . The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into this Plan of the PBG Pension
Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), ef fective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011. The PBG PEP document that was in ef fect on April 1, 2009, as
amended through January 1, 2011 (the “409A PBG PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern
PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger , except for certain administrative provisions that are now
governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is
- 1 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
explained in Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Internal Revenue
Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”) under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A
PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP Document.
2016 Restatement . This restatement of the 409A Program Document is ef fective as of April 1, 2016.
Interplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program . All benefits under the Plan that are not subject to the 409A Program (i.e., generally ,
benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially modified thereafter within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4))
shall be governed by the Plan Document for the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together , this document and the document for the
Pre‑409A Program describe the terms of a single plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms
of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification,
and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be suf ficient to permit the pre-409A
Program to remain exempt from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.

Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date of determination.
Actuarial Equivalent : Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the Plan with respect to a specific
benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the factors set forth below . The application of the following
assumptions to the computation of benefits payable under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner . In the event the Plan is
amended to provide new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless specifically
adopted by the amendment.
(1)    Annuities and Inflation Protection : To determine the amount of a Pension payable in the form of a Qualified Joint and

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
factors selected by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior factors appear in the Appendix). Thereafter , the Plan
Administrator shall review such initial factors from time to time and shall amend such factors in its discretion. A Participant shall have no

defined terms. The definition of Eligible Domestic Partner applies solely to a Participant who was actively employed by or on an Authorized Leave
of Absence from a member of the PepsiCo Organization on or after January 1, 2013 and before January 1, 2016.
(1)    On-Going Provisions . For applicable dates on or after January 1, 2016, “Eligible Domestic Partner” status is not

- 6 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(a)    Limited Exception for 2016 Plan Y ear. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and solely for applicable dates in 2016, in
the case of a Participant who (i) has a relationship with an individual on December 31, 2015 that is recognized as an eligible
domestic partner or civil union relationship under paragraph (2) below and (ii) on any date during the 2015 Plan Y ear, is either an
Employee who is actively employed or on an Authorized Leave of Absence from the PepsiCo Organization or a Participant, Eligible
Domestic Partner means the individual with whom the Participant has entered into such an arrangement that was valid on the
applicable date.

(a)    Civil Unions . If on the applicable date the Participant resides in a state that does not permit same-sex marriage
and the Participant has entered into a same-sex civil union that is valid on the applicable date in the state in which it was entered into, the
Participant’ s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with whom the Participant has entered into such a same-sex civil union. If

(b)    State of Residence Allows Neither Civil Unions Nor Marriage . If the Participant does not have an Eligible
Domestic Partner (and is not ineligible to have one) pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Participant’ s
- 7 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with whom the Participant has executed a legally binding same-sex domestic partner
agreement that meets the requirements set forth in writing by the Company with respect to eligibility for domestic partner benefits that is in
effect on the applicable date. If such Participant has not entered into such an agreement, the Participant is not eligible to have an “Eligible
Domestic Partner .”
(3)    January 1, 2013 through June 25, 2013 Provisions . For applicable dates from January 1, 2013 through June 25,
2013, Eligible Domestic Partner means an individual described in paragraph (2) above, and also includes the following: If on the applicable
date the Participant has entered into a same-sex marriage that is valid on the applicable date in the state in which it was entered into, the
Participant’ s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the Participant’ s spouse pursuant to such same-sex marriage. If the Participant resides in
a state that permits same-sex marriage, the Participant is not eligible to have an Eligible Domestic Partner unless either (a) the Participant
is in a valid same-sex marriage or (b) such state did not start to permit same-sex marriages until less than 12 months before the applicable
date.
(4)    Pre-2013 Provisions : For applicable dates before January 1, 2013, “Eligible Domestic Partner” status was not available
in the Plan.

“Eligible Domestic Partner” to the contrary . The term “Eligible Domestic Partner” does not apply to a Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or to an
individual who is of the
- 8 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
opposite sex of the Participant. A Participant who lives in a state that permits same-sex marriage is not permitted to have an Eligible
Domestic Partner . In the case of applicable dates prior to January 1, 2016, if the Participant’ s state started to permit same-sex marriage or
same-sex civil unions less than 12 months before the applicable date, the Participant is treated as residing in a state that does not permit
same-sex marriage or same-sex civil unions, as the case may be, for purposes of this definition of Eligible Domestic Partner .
Eligible Spouse : The spouse of a Participant to whom the Participant is considered lawfully married for purposes of Federal tax law
on the earlier of the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date or the date of the Participant’ s death and who, solely for periods before September 16,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Separation from Service : A Participant’ s separation from service with the PepsiCo Organization, within the meaning of Section
409A(a)(2)(A)(i). The term may also be used as a verb ( i.e., “Separates from Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the preceding

Final Separation from Service with respect to any benefits to which he becomes entitled as a result of his reemployment. The following principles
shall generally apply in determining when a Separation from Service occurs:
(1)    A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee dies, retires, or otherwise has a termination of
employment with the Company . Whether a termination of employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and
circumstance indicate that the Company and the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a

contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed over the
immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period in which the Employee provided services to the Company if the Employee has
been providing services for less than 36 months).
- 24 -

(2)    An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if such Employee is on military leave,
sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such leave does not exceed a period of six months or , if longer , such longer
period of time during which a right to re-employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six months
and the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is
deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of
absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to
last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Employee to be unable to perform the duties
of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted
for such six-month period.
(3)    If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company , the
services provided as a Director are generally not taken into account in determining whether the Employee has Separated from Service as
an Employee for purposes of the Plan, in accordance with final regulations under Section 409A.

When a 409A Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Particip ant under this Plan, the amount of such 409A Pension shall be
determined under Section 5.1 or 5.3 (whichever is applicable), subject to any adjustments required under Sections 4.6(b) and 5.4.
5.1    Participant’ s 409A Pension : Subject to Section 8.7 (Section 457A), a Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be determined as follows –
(a)    Calculating the 409A Pension : A Particip ant’s 409A Pension shall be calculated as follows (on the basis specified in

(1)    His T otal Pension, reduced by
(2)    His Salaried Plan Pension, and then further reduced by  (but not below zero)
(3)    His Pre-409A Pension.
(b)    Basis for Determining : The 409A Pension Benefit amount in subsection (a) above shall be determined on a basis that takes
into account applicable reductions for early commencement and that reflects, as applicable, the relative value of forms of payment.
(c)    Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)    A Participant’ s “Total Pension” means the greater of:
- 41 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(i)    The amount of the Participant’ s pension determined under the terms of Part B of the Salaried Plan, but without
regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied
under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (relating to benefits
that are deferred beyond the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date); or
(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under Section 5.2.
As necessary to ensure the Participant’ s receipt of a “greater of” benefit, the foregoing comparison shall be made by reflecting, as
applicable, the relative value of forms of payment.
(2)    A Participant’ s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Participant’ s pension determined under the terms of
Part B of the Salaried Plan.
(3)    A Participant’ s “Pre-409A Pension” means the amount of the Participant’ s pension determined under Section 5.6.

under subsection (b) below . In the case of other Participants, the PEP Guarantee shall not apply .

purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings” means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year , within the meaning of the
Salaried Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity attributable to any period when that
entity was not an Employer .
(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula : The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be determined under the applicable formula in
paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1)    Formulas : The amount of a Participant’ s Pension under this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with
subparagraph (i) below . However , if the Participant was actively employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible for the
Salaried Plan prior to July 1, 1975, the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts determined under
subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the amount of a V ested Pension.

(A)    3 percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the first 10 years of Credited Service,

- 43 -

In determining the amount of a V ested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be calculated on the basis of (I) the
Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement
Age, and (II) his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Separation from Service, and then
shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant’ s actual years of
Credited Service on his Separation from Service and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have
earned had he remained in the employ of an Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.
(ii)    Formula B : The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater of (A) or (B) below:
(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of years of Credited Service, less
50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount, or
(B)    3 percent of Highest A verage Monthly Earnings times the number of years of Credited Service up to 15
years, less 50 percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount.

Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at the date of disability .

Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity
under this section, with no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’ s death and
shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s death. If the Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this
subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
- 45 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic
Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.

than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.

equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section
4.6(b) reductions for any Pre  Retirement Spouse’ s coverage and Section 4.12(b) reductions for any Pre-Retirement Domestic
Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
- 46 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that provides an Eligible Spouse or
Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner , that is greater
than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so
that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the Pension otherwise
payable under the foregoing provisions of this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that provides a survivor annuity for
a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner . In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension under this

a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’ s life.

protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance, the Participant’ s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that

protection.
- 47 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion : The amount of the Retirement Pension determined under this section for a Participant
whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee determined under this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and
any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
For purposes of this paragraph (2), actuarial equivalence shall be determined taking into account the PEP Guarantee’ s purpose to
preserve substantially the value of a benefit under the pre-1989 terms of the Plan and the 409A Plan’ s design that of fers alternative
annuities that are considered actuarial equivalent for purposes of Section 409A (taking into account, without limitation, the special rule for
subsidized joint and survivor annuities in T reasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(b)(ii)(C)).
5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension     : The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s 409A Pension payable

(2)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, and then further reduced by  (but not below
zero)
(3)    The Eligible Spouse’ s Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension derived from the Pre-409A Program.
(b)    Definitions : The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

(i)    The amount of the Eligible Spouse’ s pre-retirement spouse’ s pension determined under the terms of Part B of the
Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are

Plan; or
(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’ s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension determined under
subsection (c).
In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated as if payable as of what would be the
Normal Retirement Date of the Participant related to the Eligible Spouse.

(i)    Separated from Service on the date of death (or , if earlier , his actual Separation from Service);
(ii)    Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date payments of the Qualified Pre-Retirement

409A. For this purpose and to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A, the PEP Guarantee under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-
service distributions and prior
- 51 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any
specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans : If the benefit paid under a specified plan on behalf of a Participant is

under Section 409A. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder , the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable
to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans to the
maximum extent permissible under Section 409A.

7.3    Claims Procedure : The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to
decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and its decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As
a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to
them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the Plan Administrator is
to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal
under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to
a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the
Plan Administrator , will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator , a comprehensible
written notice setting forth:
(a)    The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b)    Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c)    A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim and an
explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d)    A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process and a statement of the
claimant’ s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on review).
- 73 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim it may extend the response period
from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special
circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Committee expects to make the final decision. The claim review procedure is
available upon written request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator , or the designated party , within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of written
notice of the denial of the claim. Upon review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including the
opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator ’s
review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial
determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of
time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day
period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. The
final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with
references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request ad free of
charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record
before the Plan Administrator at the
- 74 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section as
is more fully explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this section may be sent pursuant to
any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.
7.4    Effect of Specific References : Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion shall create no inference that the
Plan Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:  Before filing any Claim (including a suit or other action)
in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’ s rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is intended to be interpreted to
require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or ef fect this intent may be taken).
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of the Plan’ s claims procedure as
described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was
before Plan Administrator in the claims procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other Disputes that are not Claims
(including those that a court
- 75 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in
connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the Plan
Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such
Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or
act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.5 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis or to address unusual conflicts
concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is
required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply .
(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter .
(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan
(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of applicable law;

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly adopted or put into ef fect;
(E)    The administration of the Plan;
(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or requirements of ERISA or
other applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part,
incorporated into the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty; or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan Administrator , or (ii) relates to the
Plan in any way .
(iii)    A “Claimant” is any Employee, former Employee, Participant, former Participant, Beneficiary (or the spouse,
former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a
relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.

constructive knowledge of the acts that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this

8.1    Nonguarantee of Employment : Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer

discharge any of its Employees, with or without cause.
8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits : Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits under the Plan shall not be subject in
any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either

be null and void and not binding on the Company . The Company shall not in any manner be liable for , or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities,
engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits hereunder .
8.3    Unfunded Plan : The Company’ s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Company
payable when due out of the Company’ s general funds. To the extent the Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this
Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company .
- 80 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
8.4    Action by the Company : Any action by the Company under this Plan may be made by the Board of Directors of the Company or by

(a)    General : It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the applicable requirements of
Section 409A. Further , in the event that the Plan shall be deemed not to comply with Section 409A, then neither the Company , the Board of
Directors, the Plan Administrator nor its or their designees or agents shall be liable to any Participant or other person for actions, decisions or
determinations made in good faith.
(b)    Non-duplication of benefits : In the interest of clarity , and to determine benefits in compliance with the requirements of Section
409A, provisions have been included in this 409A Document describing the calculation of benefits under certain specific circumstances, for
example, provisions relating to the inclusion of salary continuation during certain window severance programs in the calculation of Highest
Average Monthly Earnings, as specified in Appendix B. Notwithstanding this or any
- 81 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
similar provision, no duplication of benefits may at any time occur under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent that a specific provision of the Plan
provides for recognizing a benefit determining element (such as pensionable earnings or service) and this same element is or could be
recognized in some other way under the Plan, the specific provision of the Plan shall govern and there shall be absolutely no duplicate
recognition of such element under any other provision of the Plan, or pursuant to the Plan’ s integration with the Salaried Plan. This provision shall
govern over any contrary provision of the Plan that might be interpreted to support duplication of benefits.
8.7    Section 457A : To avoid the application of Code section 457A (“Section 457A”) to a Participant’ s Pension, the following shall apply to

Service or has the age
- 82 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
attainment that results in such Benefit Enhancement, and then only to the extent permissible under subsection (c) below at that time; and
(c)    The Participant shall have no legal right to (and the Participant shall not receive) any Benefit Enhancement that relates to
Service or age attainment from and after the Covered T ransfer to the extent such Benefit Enhancement would constitute compensation that is
includable in income under Section 457A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsection (a) above shall not apply to a Participant who has a Covered T ransfer if, prior to the Covered T ransfer , the
Company provides a written communication (either to the Participant individually , to a group of similar Participants, to Participants generally , or in any
other way that causes the communication to apply to the Participant – i.e., an “applicable communication”) that these subsections do not apply to the
Covered T ransfer in question. Subsection (b) shall cease to apply as of the earlier of – (i) the date the Participant returns to service for a member of the
PepsiCo Organization that is a United States corporation or a pass-through entity that is wholly owned by a United States corporation, or (ii) the ef fective
date for such cessation that is stated in an applicable communication.

ERISA Plan Structure
This Plan document in conjunction with the plan document(s) for the Pre-409A Program encompasses three separate plans within the
meaning of ERISA, as are set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c). This division into separate plans became ef fective as of July 1, 1996; previously the
plans set forth in subsections (b) and (c) were a single plan within the meaning of ERISA.
(a)    Excess Benefit Plan : An excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA, maintained solely for the purpose
of providing benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.
(b)    Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of
ERISA. The plan provides benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code on
benefits under the Salaried Plan (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan). For ERISA reporting purposes, this
portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan I.
(c)    Preservation T op Hat Plan : A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation
for a select group of
- 86 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides preserves
benefits for those Salaried Plan participants described in section 5.2(a) hereof, by preserving for them the pre-1989 level of benefit accrual that
was in ef fect before the Salaried Plan’ s amendment ef fective January 1, 1989 (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit
Plan and Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan). For ERISA reporting purposes, this portion of PEP shall be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension
Equalization Plan II.
Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (a) above; then any
remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation T op Hat Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above;
then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Preservation T op Hat Plan. These three plans are severable for any and all purposes as directed by
the Company .
In addition to the above, to the extent that lump sum termination benefits are paid under this Plan in connection with a severed employee’ s
Special Early Retirement (as defined in Appendix Article D) under a temporary severance program sponsored by the Company , this portion of the Plan
shall be a component of the Company’ s unfunded severance plan that includes the temporary program of severance benefits in question. As a
component of a severance plan, the lump sum termination benefits are welfare benefits, and this portion is part of a “welfare benefit plan” under ERISA
section 3(1). This severance plan component shall exist solely (i) for the duration of the temporary severance program in question, and (ii) for the
purpose of paying severance benefits. As a portion of an ERISA welfare plan, any such
- 87 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
temporary severance benefits hereunder shall not be subject to the reporting requirements for top hat plans under ERISA or any of the ERISA
requirements for pension plans.

(2)    Operating Rules for 2006 and 2007 . To ensure that the Company did not fail to identify any Key Employees, in the case of

409A Program. Any action that may be taken (and, to the extent possible, any action actually taken) by the Plan Administrator or the Company
shall not be taken (or shall be void and without ef fect), if such action violates the requirements of Section 409A or if such action would adversely
affect the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. If the failure to take an action under the Plan would violate Section 409A, then to the extent it is
possible thereby to avoid a violation of Section 409A, the rights and ef fects under the Plan shall be altered to avoid such violation. A

requirements of Section 409A, but that is not expressly set forth, shall be deemed to be set forth herein, and the Plan shall be administered in all

APPENDIX ARTICLE F - 
U.K. Supplementary Appendix Participants with U.S. Service
F.1    Scope :
This Article applies to “Covered U.K. Employees” as defined in Section F .2 below . The benefit of a Covered U.K. Employee shall be determined
as provided in Section F .3 below . Once a benefit is determined for a Covered U.K. Employee under this Article, it shall be paid in accordance with the
Plan’ s normal terms regarding the time and form of payment. All benefits payable under this Article are subject to Code section 409A. This Article has
been restated ef fective January 1, 2016 (the original version of this Article was ef fective January 1, 2011, and it applied, in accordance with its prior
terms, to periods of service before January 1, 2016).
F.2    “Covered U.K. Employee” Defined :
A “Covered U.K. Employee” is a participant in the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (“U.K. Participant”) who – (i) becomes subject to United States
income taxes, e.g., by transferring to a position with the Company in the United States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as “Engages in U.S.
Service”), (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service, (iii) would have also accrued a
benefit under the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the unavailability of
accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service), (iv) subsequently either – (A) is localized in the United States
as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization, or (B) terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the
U.K. Participant commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States, as defined
- 124 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
in the Code), and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses, is then designated by the Company (in its completely unfettered discretion) as
a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally binding right to a benefit under this Article F at the time of the designation. The period that a
U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service shall begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his “U.S. Commencement
Date”), and it shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or , if earlier , the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence
(his “U.S. Cessation Date”).
F.3    Benefit for Covered U.K. Employees :
A Covered U.K. Employee’ s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating, as of his Modified U.S. Cessation Date, his “T otal U.K.
Supplementary Benefit” and then subtracting from this amount his “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit.” For this purpose, a Covered U.K. Employee’ s—
(a)    “Modifed U.S. Cessation Date” is the earliest of the following – (i) the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes, (ii) the date
he first satisfies clause (iv) of Section F .2, (iii) the date he commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the
United States (as defined in the Code), or (iv) the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence.
- 125 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he would have under the terms of the U.K. Supplementary
Pension Appendix, calculated based on all service and compensation with the Company through his Modified U.S. Cessation Date that is counted
in the calculation of his benefit under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (or that would be counted but for a limitation applicable to the plan under
U.K. law), and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this Article F
commence, and
(c)    “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the U.K. Supplementary Pension
Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date, and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is
payable as of the date his benefits under this Article F commence.
The calculation provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the operating rules set forth in Section F .4 below .
F.4    Operating Rules:
The following operating rules apply to the calculation in Section F .3. above.
(a)    In general, accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K. Employee’ s U.S. Cessation Date shall
not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section F .3. Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F .3 to the
contrary , to the extent a Covered U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K. Employee’ s
U.S. Cessation Date have more than fully of fset the Covered U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix (and
the excess would have been of fset
- 126 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
against the benefit under this Article F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix), then any such excess as of the date
benefits under this Article F commence (expressed as a lump sum as of such date) shall be of fset against the benefits under this Article F to the
extent such of fset would not violate Code Section 409A.
(b)    In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F , the actuarial assumptions that are used shall be actuarial assumptions
that comply with Section 417(e) of the Code and, specifically , are the Code Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the PepsiCo
Salaried Employees Retirement Plan to pay a retirement lump sum as of the date applicable that the lump sum in question is to be determined
under this Article F .
(c)    A Covered U.K. Employee’ s Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit shall be determined on the basis of assuming that the Covered U.K.
employee voluntarily terminated employment and any other service relationship with the PepsiCo Organization as of immediately before his U.S.
Commencement Date.
(d)    This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix are amended
during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F .3 calculation, and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the
immediately following year . In this case, to the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the calculation in Section F .3
shall be made by delaying the application of the amendment so that it is prospectively ef fective starting with the immediately following year .
- 127 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(e)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii)
then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service,
the foregoing terms shall be applied again to determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service, except that any
resulting benefit from this new period shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely
avoid any duplication of benefits).
(f)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii)
then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would be eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than
this Article F (the “Other Provisions”), then the Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for
the new period of service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period of service shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any prior
benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
F.5    No Other Benefits :
A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or
while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F .2. were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee). In
addition, prior to the time that an individual has satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee, the individual has no legally
binding right to a benefit under this Article F . Accordingly , for the avoidance of doubt, at any point
- 128 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
before such time, the Company may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F ( e.g., by deciding
that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee, in an unfettered exercise of the Company’ s discretion), regardless of the services
performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time, and regardless of any other factor .

APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG
Effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2011, the PBG PEP is hereby merged with and into the PepsiCo PEP , with the PepsiCo PEP as the
surviving plan after the merger . The following Appendix Article PBG governs PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior
to the merger , except as follows: Articles VII (Administration), VIII (Miscellaneous), IX (Amendment and T ermination), X (ERISA Plan Structure) and XI
(Applicable Law) of the main section of this document shall govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document. There shall
be no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Code section 409A under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Document as
a result of the plan merger or the revisions made to the 409A PBG PEP Document when it was incorporated into this Appendix.
ARTICLE I - HIST ORY AND PURPOSE
1.1    History of Plan . The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) ef fective April 6, 1999
for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The
Plan was initially established as a successor plan to the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’ s April 6, 1999 initial public of fering, and the
Plan included historical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan provides benefits for
eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In
addition, the Plan provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989
- 130 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009, the Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under the Salaried Plan is reduced due
to the employees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program and for certain executives who would be “Grandfathered
Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP (or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Ef fective
Time). The Plan is intended as a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the Plan that provides benefits based on
limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is intended to be an “excess benefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5)
of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended to be a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a
select group of management or highly-compensated employees.
The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement ef fective as of April 1, 2009
(“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG with and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company , Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the
Company and Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Company , Inc., and to facilitate the Company’ s assumption of PBG’ s role as the Plan’ s sponsor .
1.2    Effect of Amendment and Restatement . The Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 is referred to herein as the Prior Plan.
Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Section 6.1(b)(3) of this Plan, a Participant’ s benefit (including death benefits), determined under the terms of
the Plan as in ef fect on October 3,
- 131 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
2004 as if the Participant had terminated employment on December 31, 2004, without regard to any compensation paid or services rendered after 2004,
or any other events af fecting the amount of or the entitlement to benefits (other than the Participant’ s survival or the Participant’ s election under the
terms of the Plan with respect to the time or form of benefit) (the “Grandfathered Benefit”) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided by the terms
of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004.
The benefit of a Participant accrued under this Plan based on all compensation and services taken into account by the Prior Plan and this Plan, less the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be paid in the times and in the form as provided in this Plan. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this
Plan, this Plan superseded the Prior Plan ef fective January 1, 2009, with respect to amounts accrued and vested after 2004 by Participants who had not
commenced receiving benefits as of January 1, 2009. The Plan was administered in accordance with a good faith interpretation of Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008. Amounts accrued under this
Plan after 2004 shall be treated as payable under a separate Plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

(1)    For purposes of determining the amount of a Retirement, V ested, Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension, or Pre-Retirement
Domestic Partner ’s Pension, the Primary Social Security Amount shall be the estimated monthly amount that may be payable to a
Participant commencing at age 65 as an old-age insurance benefit under the provisions of T itle II of the Social Security Act, as amended.

However , in computing a V ested Pension under Section 4.2, the estimate of the old-age insurance benefit to which a Participant
would be entitled at age 65 shall be based upon the assumption that he continued to receive social security wages until age 65 at the
same rate as the T axable W age Base in ef fect at the earlier of his severance from employment or the date such participant ceased to
accrue benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan. For purposes of this subsection, “social security wages” shall mean wages

to Treasury Reg. §§ 1.415(c)-2(d), 1.415(c)-2(e), and 1.415(c)-2(g). The Plan Administrator shall determine who is a Specified Employee
in accordance with Section 416(i) of the Code and the applicable regulations and other guidance of general applicability issued thereunder
or in connection therewith, and provided further that the applicable year shall be determined in accordance with Section 409A and that any
modification of the foregoing definition that applies under Section 409A shall be taken into account.

Specified Employee for purposes of the Plan for the twelve-month period commencing of the applicable April 1st date. However , if there
are at least 200 Specified Employees without regard to this provision, then it shall not apply . If there are less than 200 Specified
Employees without regard to this provision, but full application of this provision would cause there to be more than 200 Specified
Employees, then (to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding 200 Specified Employees) those Employees classified as E5 and above who
have the lowest base salaries on such applicable determination date shall not be Specified Employees.
(4)    Identification of Specified Employees Between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010 . Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the
period between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010, Specified Employees shall be identified by combining the lists of Specified

Employees that complies with T reas. Reg. §§ 1.409A-1(i)(5) and -1(i)(8) and Section VII.C.4.d of the Preamble to the Final Regulations
under Section 409A of
- 141 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
the Code, which permits “service recipients to simply combine the pre-transaction separate lists of specified employees where it is
determined that such treatment would be administratively less burdensome.”
(5)     Identification of Specified Employees on and After April 1, 2010 . Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the periods on after April 1,
2010, Key Employees shall be identified as follows:
(i)     For the period that begins on April 1, 2010, and ends on March 31, 2011, an employee shall be a Specified Employee
(subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if he was classified as at least a Band IV or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this
purpose, an employee shall be considered to be at least a Band IV or its equivalent as of a date if the employee is classified as one
of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Organization on that date: (i) a Band IV employee or above in a PepsiCo
Business, (ii) a Level E7 employee or above in a PBG Business, or (iii) a Salary Grade 19 employee or above at a P AS Business.
(ii)    For the twelve-month period that begins on April 1, 2011, and for each twelve-month period that begins on April 1 in
subsequent years, an employee shall be a Specified Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if the employee was an employee of the PepsiCo

employee, within the meaning of T reasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i), or any successor , by applying as of such December 31 the default rules that apply
under such regulation for determining the minimum number of a service recipient’ s specified employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods for
identifying Specified Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together , would result in more than 200 individuals being counted as
Specified Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of individuals treated as Specified Employees pursuant to
subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration
those employees otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to the highest.
(iv)    For purposes of this paragraph (5), “P AS Business” means each employer , division of an employer or other
organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the P AS business; “PBG Business” means each employer , division of
an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PBG business; and “PepsiCo Business”
means each employer , division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PepsiCo
business.
The method for identifying Specified Employees set forth in this definition is intended as an alternative method of identifying Specified Employees

arrangements.

Section 4.1, whichever is applicable. Such amount shall be determined as of the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(a)    Same Form as Salaried Plan . If a Participant’ s PEP Pension will be paid in the same form and will commence as of the same time
as his pension under the Salaried Plan, then his monthly PEP Pension shall be equal to the excess of:
(1)    The greater of:
(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under the Salaried Plan without regard
to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415 Limitation; (III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the

classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and had attained age 50 and completed five years of Service or whose sum of his age and
years of Service was at least 65; and
(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in such form and payable as of such
time; over
(2)    The amount of the monthly pension benefit that is in fact payable to such Salaried Plan Participant under the Salaried Plan,
expressed in such form and payable as of such time.
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit,
shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
(b)    Different Form than Salaried Plan . If a Participant’ s PEP Pension will be paid in a dif ferent form (whether in whole or in part) or will
commence as of a dif ferent time than his pension benefit under the Salaried Plan, his PEP Pension shall be the product of:
(1)    The greater of:
(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under the Salaried Plan without regard
to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415 Limitation; (III) the
- 146 -

(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in the form and payable as of such time
as applies to his PEP Pension under this Plan, multiplied by
(2)    A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1), reduced by the value of his
pension under the Salaried Plan, and the denominator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1) (with value
determined on a reasonable and consistent basis, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator , with respect to similarly situated employees).
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit,
shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event any portion of the accrued benefit of a Participant under this Plan or the Salaried Plan is awarded
to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order , as such terms are defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, the Participant’ s
total PEP Pension shall be adjusted, as the Plan
- 147 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Administrator shall determine, so that the combined benefit payable to the Participant and the alternate payee from this Plan and the Salaried
Plan is the amount determined pursuant to subsections 4.1(a) and (b) above, as applicable.
4.2    PEP Guarantee . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be entitled to a PEP Guarantee
benefit determined under subsection (b) below , if any .
(a)    Eligibility . A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable earnings from an Employer of at
least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings” means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year that
was recognized for benefit accrual received under the Salaried Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include
remuneration from an entity attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer .
(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be determined under paragraph (1), subject to the
special rules in paragraph (2).
(1)    Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this paragraph shall be determined as follows:
(i)    Three percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the first 10 years of Credited Service, plus
(ii)    One percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for each year of Credited Service in excess of 10
years, less
(iii)    One and two-thirds percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount multiplied by years of Credited Service
not in excess of 30 years.
- 148 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension, the PEP Guarantee shall first be calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service
the Participant would have earned had he continued to accrue Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest
Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such
Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan, and then shall be reduced by multiplying the
resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant’ s actual years of Credited Service on the earlier of his Severance
from Service Date or the date such Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan and the
denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he continued to accrue Credited Service until his Normal
Retirement Age.
(2)    Calculation . The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (1) above, subject to the following
special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity : Subject to subparagraph (iii) below and the last
sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner and has commenced receipt of
an Annuity under this section, the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a survivor
annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding reduction
- 149 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the
first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the
Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is more than 10 years
younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is
younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than
the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.
This subparagraph applies only to a Participant who retires on or after his Early Retirement Date.
(ii)    Reductions . The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee.
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1
- 150 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
percent for each month by which the benefit commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal
Retirement Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the
amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the reductions set forth in the
Salaried Plan for any Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that provides an Eligible Spouse or
Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner , that is greater than
that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that
the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the PEP Guarantee otherwise payable
under the foregoing provisions of this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that provides a survivor annuity for a
beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner . In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this
section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s
- 151 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an Annuity form that includes inflation protection
described in the Salaried Plan. In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the total
value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion . The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant whose Retirement
Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined
under this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement reductions
under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
(iv)    April 1, 2009 Salaried Plan Changes.
- 152 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(A)    The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant who, as of March 31, 2009, was
classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and who had attained age 50 and completed five years of Service or (inclusively) whose sum
of his age and years of Service was at least 65 shall be determined as if such Participant were a Grandfathered Participant in the
Salaried Plan on April 1, 2009 (so that Earnings and Credited Service were not frozen as of March 31, 2009 for the period April 1,
2009 through December 31, 2010).
(B)    Highest A verage Monthly Earnings shall be determined without regard to the exclusion from Earnings under the
Salaried Plan of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1,
2011.
4.3    Certain Adjustments . Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to adjustment as provided in this
section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified
pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a member of the PBG Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals
(this category of similar plans includes the PepsiCo Prior Plan).
(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants . This subsection shall apply to a current or former Participant who is reemployed after his
Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service, or (ii)
whose benefit under the Salaried Plan would have been recalculated, based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would
- 153 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
have been considered a Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant was not classified by the
Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP . In such event, the Participant’ s PEP Pension shall be recalculated hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP
Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the
Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans . If the benefit paid under a specified plan on behalf of a Participant is
increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan
administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an
overpayment hereunder , the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended
that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
(c)    No Benefit Offsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . If a Participant has earned a benefit under a plan maintained by a member of
the PepsiCo/PBG Organization that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan
and the “T ransfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and Non-Duplication rules shall apply
when calculating the amount determined under Section 4.1(a)(1) or 4.1(b)(1) above (as applicable) only to the extent the application of such rule
will not result in a change in the time or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on of fsets in
the preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s intent to
- 154 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under
the qualifying plan, and compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent possible;
to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into ef fect in a particular situation, the limit on of fsets in the prior
sentence will not apply .
4.4    Reemployment of Certain Participants . In the case of a current or former Participant who is reemployed and is eligible to reparticipate in
the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his non-Grandfathered PEP Pension will not be suspended. If such Participant accrues an
additional PEP Pension for service after such reemployment, his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the
present value of PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
4.5    Vesting; Misconduct . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at the time he becomes fully vested
in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, or any other provision of the Plan to the contrary , a Participant shall forfeit
his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan Administrator determines that such Participant has engaged in “Misconduct” as defined below , determined
without regard to whether the Misconduct occurred before or after the Participant’ s Severance from Service. The Plan Administrator may , in its sole
discretion, require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the Participant within the twelve month period immediately preceding
a date on which the Participant has engaged in such Misconduct, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
- 155 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
“Misconduct” means any of the following, as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith: (i) violation of any agreement between the
Company or Employer and the Participant, including but not limited to a violation relating to the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets,
the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers, licensors or contractors, or the performance of competitive services, (ii) violation of any duty to the
Company or Employer , including but not limited to violation of the Company’ s Code of Conduct; (iii) making, or causing or attempting to cause any other
person to make, any statement (whether written, oral or electronic), or conveying any information about the Company or Employer which is disparaging
or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company or Employer unless required by law or pursuant to a Company or Employer policy; (iv)
improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing any confidential information regarding the Company or Employer; (v) unlawful trading in the securities of the
Company or of another company based on information garnered as a result of that Participant’ s employment or other relationship with the Company; (vi)
engaging in any act which is considered to be contrary to the best interests of the Company or Employer , including but not limited to recruiting or
soliciting employees of the Employer; or (vii) commission of a felony or other serious crime or engaging in any activity which constitutes gross
misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with
government authorities concerning any possible legal violations.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over
any information appropriately protected by the privilege.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
ARTICLE V - DEA TH BENEFITS
5.1    Death Benefits . Each Participant entitled to a PEP Pension under this Plan who dies before his Annuity Starting Date shall be entitled to a

Pension as determined under Article IV was payable under the Salaried Plan instead of this Plan. The death benefit with respect to a Participant’ s PEP
Pension in excess of the Grandfathered Benefit shall become payable on the Participant’ s date of death in a Single Lump Sum payment.
Payment of any death benefit of a Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date under the Plan shall be made to the persons and in the

commences, the election shall be given ef fect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary shall
commence on the first day of the month following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the
case of a Participant who elected a 10 Y ear Certain and Life Annuity , if such Participant dies: (i) after benefits have commenced; (ii)
without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment, then the
remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If payments have commenced under such
form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed,
- 160 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.

(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.1(b)(2) with a nonspouse beneficiary more than 10 years younger than
he is, or
(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.1(b)(2) with a nonspouse beneficiary more than 19 years younger than
he is.
6.3    Designation of Beneficiary . A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor
option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form.
A Participant shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his election is finally ef fective. The
designation of any beneficiary , and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A
beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator
6.4    Determination of Single Lump Sum Amounts . Except as otherwise provided below , a Single Lump Sum payable under Article V or
Section 6.1 shall be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment option prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan.
(a)    Vested Pensions . If on the date of Separation from Service of a Participant such Participant is not entitled to retire with an immediate
pension under the Salaried Plan, the Single Lump Sum payable to the Participant under Section 6.1 shall
- 161 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment option prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan but substituting
(for Plan Y ears beginning before 2012) the applicable segment rates for the blended 30 year T reasury and segment rates that would otherwise be
applicable.
(b)    2008 Reorganization . Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Single Lump Sum payment for a Participant whose employment
was involuntarily terminated as a result of the 2008 Reorganization on or after November 1, 2008 and on or before December 19, 2008 shall be
determined based on the applicable interest rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for optional lump sum distributions in December 2008,
provided that in no event shall such Single Lump Sum payment be less than the Single Lump Sum determined based on the applicable interest
rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for lump sum distributions for the month in which the Single Lump Sum is distributed to the
Participant.
6.5    Section 162(m) Postponement . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , no PEP Pension shall be paid to any
Participant prior to the earliest date on which the Company’ s federal income tax deduction for such payment is not precluded by Section 162(m) of the
Code. In the event any payment is delayed solely as a result of the preceding restriction, such payment shall be made as soon as administratively
feasible following the first date as of which Section 162(m) of the Code no longer precludes the deduction by the Company of such payment. Amounts
deferred because of the Section 162(m) deduction limitation shall be increased by simple interest for the period of delay at the annual rate of six percent
(6%).

ARTICLE I – FOREWORD
PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”) established the PepsiCo Automatic Retirement Contribution Equalization Plan (the “Plan”) for the benefit of employees of the
PepsiCo Or ganization who receive Automatic Retirement Contributions under the PepsiCo Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”), and whose Automatic Retirement
Contributions are af fected by certain Code limitations. In particular , the Plan is designed to benefit eligible employees whose Automatic Retirement Contributions
under the Savings Plan are curtailed by the limitation on compensation under Code section 401(a)(17) or the limitation on annual additions under Code section 415, or
who have any other reductions in Automatic Retirement Contributions as a result of the employee’ s deferrals under the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program
(the “EID Program).
The Plan was originally ef fective as of January 1, 201 1. Also as of the beginning of the day on this date, the PBG Supplemental Savings Plan (the “PBG Plan”)
merged with and into this Plan. Appendix A of this Plan sets forth special provision applicable to amounts that were earned under the PBG Plan.
The Plan is amended and restated ef fective as of April 1, 2016.
At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the Code and ERISA. The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive’ s
individual employer . With respect to his or her employer , the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor .

may establish one or more subaccounts as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan, and may also combine one or more subaccounts to the

The individuals identified in accordance with the following paragraphs.
(a) In General . Any Participant who at any time during the applicable year is:

purposes of this Section, annual compensation means compensation as defined in T reasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2(a), without regard to T reasury
Regulation sections 1.415(c)-2(d), 1.415(c)-2(e), and 1.415(c)-2(g). The Plan Administrator shall determine who is a Key Employee in accordance with
Code section 416(i) (provided, that Code section 416(i)(5) shall not apply in making such determination), and provided further than the applicable year
shall be determined in accordance with Section 409A and that any modification or clarification of the foregoing definition that applies under Section
409A shall be taken into account (determined in accordance with T reasury Regulation section 1.419A-1(i), and giving ef fect to the default rules that
apply under such regulation for determining the minimum number of a service recipient’ s specified employees).
(b) Applicable Y ear. The Plan Administrator shall determine Key Employees ef fective as of the last day of each calendar year , based on compensation for
such year , and such designation shall be ef fective for purposes of this Plan for the
4
twelve-month period commencing on April 1st of the next following calendar year ( e.g., the Key Employee determination by the Plan Administrator as
of December 31, 2010 shall apply to the period from April 1, 201 1 to March 31, 2012).
(c) Rule of Administrative Convenience . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator shall apply the following rule of administrative
convenience for determining Key Employees for purposes of complying with the six-month payment delay that is required under Section 409A of the
Code with respect to such employees:
(1) From January 1, 201 1 until March 31, 201 1, an employee shall be a Key Employee (subject to paragraph (3) below) if he was classified as at
least a Band 4 or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this purpose, an employee shall be considered to be at least a Band 4 or its equivalent
as of a date if the employee is classified as one of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Or ganization on that date: (i) a Band 4
employee or above in a PepsiCo Business, (ii) a Level E7 employee or above in a PBG Business, or (iii) a Salary Grade 19 employee or above at
a PAS Business. For purposes of this paragraph, “P AS Business” means each employer , division of an employer or other or ganizational
subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the P AS business; “PBG Business” means each employer , division of an
employer or other or ganizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PBG business; and “PepsiCo Business”
means each employer , division of an employer or other or ganizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the
PepsiCo business.
(2) For the twelve-month period that begins on April 1, 201 1, and for each twelve-month period that begins on April 1 in subsequent years, an
employee shall be a Key Employee (subject to paragraph (3) below) if the employee was an employee of the PepsiCo Or ganization who was
5
classified as Band 4 or above on the December 31 that immediately precedes such April 1.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) above, an employee shall be a Key Employee for the 12-month period that begins on any April 1, if as of
the preceding December 31 the employee would be a Key Employee under the provisions of subsection (a) above. If the preceding sentence and
the methods for identifying Key Employees set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) above, taken together , would result in more than 200 individuals
being counted as Key Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of individuals treated as Key Employees pursuant
to paragraph (1) or (2), who are not described in the first sentence of this paragraph (3), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from
consideration those employees otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to
the highest.

Section 409A.
Section 409A of the Code.
Separation fr om Service.
A Participant’ s separation from service with the PepsiCo Or ganization, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). The term may also be used as a verb
(i.e., “Separates from Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’ s transfer to an entity owned 20% or more by
the Company will not constitute a Separation of Service to the extent permitted by Section 409A. The following principles shall generally apply in determining
when a Separation from Service occurs:
(a) A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee has a termination of employment with the Company other than for death.
Whether a termination of employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstances indicate that the Company and the
Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a certain date or that
8
the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (as an employee or independent contractor) would permanently decrease to
no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period in
which the Employee provided services to the Company if the Employee has been providing services for less than 36 months).
(b) An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if such Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide
leave of absence, to the extent such leave does not exceed a period of six months or , if longer , such longer period of time during which a right to re-
employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six months and the individual does not retain a right to re-
employment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such
six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can
be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Employee
to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a 29-month period of
absence shall be substituted for such six-month period. In the case of such a disability leave of absence, a Separation from Service shall occur on the
earlier of the date that the Participant has reached 29 continuous months of disability leave of absence or the date that the Participant formally resigns his
employment with the Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(c) If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company , the services provided as a Director
are generally not taken into account in determining whether the Employee has Separated from Service as an Employee for purposes of the Plan, in
accordance with final regulations under Section 409A.

ARTICLE III – ELIGIBILITY AND P ARTICIP ATION
3.1    Eligibility to Participate.
Subject to Section 3.4, an Employee shall be eligible to participate actively in the Plan as of any payroll date if he or she is an ARC Eligible Employee under the
Savings Plan and his or her Automatic Retirement Contributions for such payroll date under the Savings Plan are: (i) reduced by application of a limitation set
forth in either Code section 401(a)(17) or 415; (ii) otherwise reduced as a result of the Employee’ s deferrals under the EID Program; or (iii) af fected as
described in both (i) and (ii).
3.2    Commencement of Participation.
An Eligible Employee shall become a Participant in this Plan as of the first payroll date an Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution is allocated to his or
her Account as provided in Section 5.1.
3.3    Termination of Participation.
An Employee who becomes a Participant under the Plan shall cease to be a Participant on the date his or her Account is fully distributed as provided in Article
VI.
3.4    Agreements Not to Participate.
The eligibility provisions of this Article III will be subject to any other documents that constitute part of an agreement between the Company and an Employee
that limits or bars the Employee’ s participation in this Plan. An agreement that is otherwise described in the preceding sentence shall not limit or bar an
Employee’ s participation in this Plan for the period before the earliest date such agreement may apply without violating the restrictions on elections under
Section 409A.
11
ARTICLE IV – CONTRIBUTIONS
4.1    Equalized Automatic Retir ement Contributions.
As of each payroll date for which an Employee is an Eligible Employee, the Employer shall make an Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution to the ARC
Equalization Account of such Eligible Employee.  Subject to Section 4.2 below , the amount of each Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution shall equal –
(a) The Eligible Employee’ s Total Automatic Retirement Contribution for such payroll date, reduced by
(b) The amount of the Automatic Retirement Contribution to which the Eligible Employee is entitled under the Savings Plan for the same payroll date.
An Eligible Employee’ s “Total Automatic Retirement Contribution” is determined in the same way the Eligible Employee’ s Automatic Retirement Contribution
is required to be determined as of such payroll date under the Savings Plan, but with the following modifications: (i) the limitation on compensation imposed by
Code section 401(a)(17), as otherwise applied by the terms of the Savings Plan, shall be disregarded, (ii) the limitation on annual additions imposed by Code
section 415, as otherwise applied by the terms of the Savings Plan, shall be disregarded, and (iii) any exclusion, which is then in ef fect of amounts deferred by
the Eligible Employee under the EID Program from his or her Eligible Pay under the Savings Plan shall be disregarded. The three modifications in the preceding
sentence shall be applied so that they do not result in any duplication ( e.g., the provisions of (iii) above shall not result in an amount of T otal Automatic
Retirement Contribution to the extent such amount is provided by (ii) above).
4.2    Maximum Equalized Automatic Retir ement Contributions.
An Eligible Employee shall cease having Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions made to his or her ARC Equalization Account during any Plan Y ear as
necessary to ensure that the sum of his or her Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions under this Plan and Automatic Retirement Contributions under the
Savings Plan (collectively , the “Aggregate Employer Contributions”) equal or do not exceed the Code section 401(a)
12
(17) limit in ef fect for such Plan Y ear. An Eligible Employee’ s Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution for a payroll date shall be reduced to comply with
this Section by taking into account all Aggregate Employer Contributions, payable for all prior payroll dates in the Plan Y ear, and Automatic Retirement
Contributions under the Savings Plan payable for the current payroll date.
4.3    Offsets.
Notwithstanding an Eligible Employee’ s rights under Section 4.1 (or a Participant’ s rights under Articles V and VI), the Company may reduce the amount of
any payment or benefit that is or would become payable to or on behalf of an Eligible Employee or Participant by the amount of any obligation of the Eligible
Employee or Participant to the Company that is or becomes due and payable, provided that (a) the obligation of the Eligible Employee or Participant to the
Company was incurred during the employment relationship, (b) the reduction may not exceed the amount allowed under Section 409A and T reasury Regulation
section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xiii), and (c) the reduction is made at the same time and in the same amount as the obligation otherwise would have been due and
collectable from the Employee or Participant. Consistent with this, appropriate reductions may be made in (i) the Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution s
that otherwise would be provided to the Eligible Employee under Section 4.1, (ii) the balance in the Participant’ s Account under Article V , or (iii) the
Participant’ s distributions under Article VI. The application of this Section 4.2 is solely in the independent discretion of the Company .
13
ARTICLE V – P ARTICIP ANT ACCOUNTS
5.1    Accounting for Participants’ Inter ests.
Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions shall be credited to a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account at the same time that the Participant’ s Automatic
Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan are required to be allocated to the Participant’ s Profit-Sharing Account under the Savings Plan (or as soon as
administratively practicable thereafter) . A Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account is a bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Participant’ s
Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions (and his or her Employer ’s liability therefor). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any
ARC Equalization Account, and no ARC Equalization Account shall be funded, insured or otherwise secured.
5.2    Investment Earnings and Losses.    
As of each V aluation Date, a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account shall be credited with earnings and gains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses)
determined as if the amounts credited to his or her ARC Equalization Account had actually been invested as directed by the Participant in accordance with this
Article. The Plan provides only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such earnings, gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual. However ,
they shall be applied to measure the value of a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account and the amount of his or her Employer ’s liability to make deferred
payments to or on behalf of the Participant.
5.3    Investment of Accounts.
(a) In General . A Participant’ s Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions shall be invested on a phantom basis among the investment options that are
available for Automatic Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan from time to time, unless otherwise determined by the PIC. The PIC may
discontinue any phantom investment option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for transferring a Participant’ s phantom
investment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects another
14
replacement option in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose).
(b) Investment and Reinvestment Elections . The Participant’ s Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution for a payroll date shall be invested on a
phantom basis in the investment options and in the proportions specified by the Participant in accordance with rules applied by the Plan Administrator .
Such rules shall be based on those that apply for purposes of Automatic Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan as of such payroll date, except
as otherwise provided for by the Plan Administrator . To the extent a Participant does not specify an investment option for an Equalized Automatic
Retirement Contribution, the rules for default investments that are in ef fect under the Savings Plan as of such payment date shall apply . In addition, a
Participant shall have the same right to change the investment of the Participant’ s future Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions and to reinvest
the balance of his or her ARC Equalization Account as the Participant has for his or her Automatic Retirement Contributions and the account or
subaccount that holds such contributions under the Savings Plan, except as otherwise provided for by the Plan Administrator .
(c) Phantom Investment Options . The Plan’ s phantom investment options shall be described in materials provided to Participants from time to time. Any of
these phantom investment options shall be administered under procedures implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator . Unless otherwise
specified in these materials or procedures, in the case of any such phantom investment option that is based on a unitized fund, an amount deferred or
transferred into such option is converted to phantom units in the applicable fund of equivalent value by dividing such amount by the NA V of a unit in
such fund on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator . Thereafter , a Participant’ s interest
in each such phantom option is valued as of a V aluation Date (or a Distribution V aluation Date) by multiplying the number of
15
phantom units credited to his or her ARC Equalization Account on such date by the NA V of a unit in such fund on such date.
5.4    Vesting.
A Participant shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, the Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account at the time the Participant becomes fully
vested in his or her ARC Account under the Savings Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant’ s period of Service (as determined under the Savings
Plan for purposes of vesting) would extend beyond the Participant’ s Separation from Service date because of a leave of absence, the Plan Administrator may
provide for determining the Participant’ s nonforfeitable right to his or her ARC Equalization Account by projecting the benefit the Participant would have if all
such Service were taken into account under this Plan.
5.5    Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the Plan Administrator determines that a Participant has engaged in Prohibited
Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his or her Separation from Service, the Participant shall forfeit all Equalized Automatic
Retirement Contributions and any net earnings or gains (whether paid previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his or her ARC
Equalization Account shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture and previously paid Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions and net earnings or
gains shall be recovered.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Participant shall constitute Prohibited Misconduct:
(1) The Participant accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any ownership interest, which involves the
Participant’ s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined
below), unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes
16
Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Participant, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Participant’ s recommendation, suggestion, identification or
advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other
entity .
(3) The Participant using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo Or ganization other than as necessary in his or
her position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a
result of his or her positions with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the
PepsiCo Or ganization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations and structure; its product lines,
formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
(4) The Participant engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s best interests, including violating the
Company’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or of any other company based on information
gained as a result of his or her employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Participant engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with government
authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Company , participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any
17
applicable award for providing information to government authorities. The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege
over any information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal,
state, or local government of ficial, either directly or indirectly , or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual
who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual
and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does
not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer, employee, consultant or contractor
with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation
or testimonial on behalf of such a business entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean
any product that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Or ganization is producing, marketing, selling or licensing such
product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks, tea, water , juice drinks, sports drinks, cof fee drinks and
value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks meat snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies; hot
cereals; pancake mixes; value-added rice products; pancake syrups; value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals; dry pasta products; or any product
or service that the Participant had
18
reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo Or ganization during the Participant’ s employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
19
ARTICLE VI – P AYMENT OF BENEFITS
6.1    Distribution Rules Generally .
A Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of a Participant’ s Separation from Service or death, as provided in
Sections 6.2 and 6.3, respectively . If a Participant becomes re-employed and entitled to another distribution after the occurrence of one of the foregoing
distribution events, the rules of this Article shall apply separately to the balance in the Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account that relates to the later period of
employment. In no event shall any portion of a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account be distributed earlier or later than is allowed under Section 409A. All
distributions shall be made in a single lump sum cash payment.
6.2    Distributions Upon Separation fr om Service.
If a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account becomes distributable based upon his or her Separation from Service, such distribution shall be made in a single
lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Participant’ s Distribution V aluation Date, subject to Section 6.4 below (Delay for
Key Employees).
6.3    Distributions Upon Death.
(a) If a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account becomes distributable based upon the Participant’ s death, such distribution shall be distributed in a single
lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Participant’ s Distribution V aluation Date.
(b) Amounts paid following a Participant’ s death shall be paid to the Participant’ s Beneficiary; provided, however , that if no designation is in ef fect at the
time of a Participant’ s death (as determined by the Plan Administrator), or if all persons designated as Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant,
then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed to the Participant’ s spouse, or if the Participant is not married at the time of his
or her death, to his or her estate. The Plan Administrator shall determine whether a Participant is “married” and shall determine a Participant’ s “spouse”
based on the state or local law where
20
the Participant has his or her primary residence at the time of death. The Plan Administrator is authorized to make any applicable inquires and to request
any documents, certificates or other information that it deems necessary or appropriate in order to make the above determinations.
(c) A Participant may designate (in a manner authorized by the Plan Administrator) one or more Beneficiaries to receive payment, in the event of his or her
death, of the amounts credited to his or her ARC Equalization Account; provided that, to be ef fective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing,
signed by the Participant, and must meet such other standards (including any requirement for spousal consent) that the Plan Administrator or
Recordkeeper shall require from time to time. The Beneficiary designation must also be filed with the Recordkeeper prior to the Participant’ s death, as
determined by the Plan Administrator . An incomplete Beneficiary designation, as determined by the Recordkeeper or Plan Administrator , shall be void
and of no ef fect. A Beneficiary designation of an individual by name remains in ef fect regardless of any change in the designated individual’ s
relationship to the Participant. Any Beneficiary designation submitted to the Recordkeeper that only specifies a Beneficiary by relationship shall not be
considered an ef fective Beneficiary designation and shall be void and of no ef fect. If more than one Beneficiary is specified and the Participant fails to
indicate the respective percentage applicable to two or more Beneficiaries, then each Beneficiary for whom a percentage is not designated will be
entitled to an equal share of the portion of the ARC Equalization Account (if any) for which percentages have not been designated. At any time, a
Participant may change a Beneficiary designation for his or her ARC Equalization Account in a writing that is signed by the Participant and filed with
the Recordkeeper prior to the Participant’ s death, and that meets such other standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time. An
individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary with respect to a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all payments have
been made from the ARC Equalization Account.
21
(d) Any claim to be paid any amounts standing to the credit of a Participant in connection with the Participant’ s death must be received by the Plan
Administrator at least 14 days before any such amount is actually distributed by the Plan. Any claim received thereafter is untimely , and it shall be
unenforceable against the Plan, the Company , the Plan Administrator or any other party acting for one or more of them.
6.4    Delay for Key Employees.
(a) If the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Key
Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then the time of payment based on Separation from Service shall be determined under the
provisions of Section 6.2 as if the Distribution V aluation Date were the V aluation Date that is six months after the Distribution V aluation Date that would
otherwise apply .
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, distribution in accordance with Section 6.3 or Section 6.4 shall be given priority over distribution in accordance
with this Section if it would result in an earlier commencement date of the Participant’ s distribution.
6.5    Valuation.
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account shall continue to be credited with
earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the V aluation Date that is used in determining the amount of the
distribution under this Article.
6.6    Actual Payment Date.
An amount payable on a date specified in this Article VI shall be paid no later than the later of (a) the end of the calendar year in which the specified date
occurs, or (b) the 15th day of the third calendar month following such specified date. In no event shall the Participant (or Beneficiary) be permitted to designate
the taxable year of the payment. The payment date may be delayed further in accordance with one or more applicable
22
special rules under Section 409A that permit such later payment (for example, in the event of a bona fide dispute that meets the requirements of T reasury
Regulation section 1.409A-3(g)).
23
ARTICLE VII – PLAN ADMINISTRA TION
7.1    Plan Administrator .
The Plan Administrator is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator has the authority to name one or more delegates to carry out
certain responsibilities hereunder , as specified in the definition of Plan Administrator . Any such delegation shall state the scope of responsibilities being

7.2    Action.
Action by the Plan Administrator may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Plan Administrator adopts from time to time or that the Company’ s Law
Department determines are legally permissible.
7.3    Powers of the Plan Administrator .
The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have (and shall be permitted to delegate) all powers necessary to accomplish that
purpose, including the following:
(a) To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
(b) To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility , participation and deferrals, to make allocations and determinations
required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants’ Accounts;

Recordkeeper may take any action the Plan Administrator deems is necessary to assure compliance with any policy of the Company respecting insider
trading as may be in ef fect from time to time. Such actions may include altering the ef fective date of intra-fund transfers or the distribution date of
Participant’ s Accounts. Any such actions shall alter the normal operation of the Plan to the minimum extent necessary .
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits, to
determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this
Plan, and its decisions on such matters will be final and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and
unrestricted discretion of the Plan Administrator , even if (1) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (2) a determination is
not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or call for a determination. As a
result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to them. In the event of a review
by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal, any exercise of the Plan Administrator ’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly shown to be
arbitrary and capricious.
25
7.4    Compensation, Indemnity and Liability .
The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without compensation for services hereunder . All expenses of the Plan and the Plan Administrator will be
paid by the Employers. To the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator , any such expense may be char ged against specific Participant Accounts,
thereby reducing the obligation of the Employers. No member of the P AC (which serves as the Plan Administrator) or PIC, and no individual acting as the
delegate of the P AC or PIC, shall be liable for any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or omission on his or her own part,
excepting his or her own willful misconduct. The Employers (other than the Company) will indemnify and hold harmless each member of the P AC and PIC and
any employee of the Company (or a Company af filiate, if recognized as an af filiate for this purpose by the Plan Administrator) acting as the delegate of the P AC
or PIC against any and all expenses and liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising in connection with this Plan out of his or her
membership on the P AC or PIC (or his or her serving as the delegate of the P AC or PIC), excepting only expenses and liabilities arising out of his or her own
willful misconduct or bad faith.

The Employer shall withhold from amounts due under this Plan, any amount necessary to enable the Employer to remit to the appropriate government entity or
entities on behalf of the Participant as may be required by the federal income tax provisions of the Code, by an applicable state’ s income tax provisions, and by
an applicable city , county or municipality’ s earnings or income tax provisions. Further , the Employer shall withhold from the payroll of, or collect from, a
Participant the amount necessary to remit on behalf of the Participant any Social Security or Medicare taxes which may be required with respect to amounts
deferred or accrued by a Participant hereunder , as determined by the Employer . In addition, to the extent required by Section 409A, amounts deferred under this
Plan shall be reported on each Participant’ s Form W -2 for the applicable tax year , and any amounts that become taxable hereunder shall be reported as taxable
wages on the
26
Participant’ s Form W -2 for the applicable tax year . All such reporting and withholding shall be performed based on the rules and procedures of Section 409A.
7.6    Conformance with Section 409A.
At all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. In all cases, the provisions of this Section
shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.

ARTICLE VIII – CLAIMS PROCEDURE
8.1    Claims for Benefits.
If a Participant, Beneficiary or other person (hereafter , “Claimant”) does not receive timely payment of any benefits which he or she believes are due and
payable under the Plan, he or she may make a claim for benefits to the Plan Administrator . The claim for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan
Administrator . If the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant within 90 days after the Plan Administrator initially received
the benefit claim. However , if special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the
extension to the Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 90-day period. Any
notice of a denial of benefits shall advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial, any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his
or her claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to appeal his or her claim for benefits.
8.2    Appeals of Denied Claims.

review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he or she received the notice denying his or her claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be
communicated to the Claimant within 60 days after receipt of a request for appeal. The notice shall set forth the basis for the Plan Administrator ’s decision.
However , if special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the appeal, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the
Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 60-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 60-day period. In no event shall the
Plan Administrator ’s decision be rendered later than 120 days after receipt of a request for appeal.
28
8.3    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under this Article VIII and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Participant, Beneficiary or
any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or
violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a
cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received
the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which
payments shall commence, or (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. For purposes of this
subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged interference with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or
constructive knowledge of the acts that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-
year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other
communications following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 8.2 shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
8.4 Restriction on V enue.

ARTICLE IX – AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
9.1     Amendment to the Plan.
(a) The Company , or its delegate, has the right in its sole discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time and in any manner , including the terms
and conditions of Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions, the terms on which distributions are made, and the form and timing of distributions.
However , except for mere clarifying amendments necessary to avoid an inappropriate windfall, no Plan amendment shall reduce the balance of a
Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account as of the date such amendment is adopted. In addition, the Company shall have the limited right to amend the
Plan at any time, retroactively or otherwise, in such respects and to such extent as may be necessary to fully qualify it under existing and applicable laws
and regulations, and if and to the extent necessary to accomplish such purpose, may by such amendment decrease or otherwise af fect benefits to which
Participants may have already become entitled, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary .
(b) The Company’ s right to amend the Plan shall not be af fected or limited in any way by a Participant’ s Separation from Service, death or disability . Prior
practices by the Company or an Employer shall not diminish in any way the rights granted the Company under this Section. Also, it is expressly
permissible for an amendment to af fect less than all of the Participants covered by the Plan.
(c) Any amendment shall be in writing and adopted by the Company or by any of ficer of the Company who has authority or who has been granted or
delegated the authority to amend this Plan. An amendment or restatement of this Plan shall not af fect the validity or scope of any grant or delegation of
such authority , which shall instead be solely determined based upon the terms of the grant or delegation (as determined under applicable law). All
Participants and Beneficiaries shall be bound by such amendment.
30
(d) Any amendments made to the Plan shall be subject to any restrictions on amendment that are applicable to ensure continued compliance under Section
409A.
9.2    Termination of Plan.
(a) The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The Company reserves the right to discontinue and terminate the Plan at
any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or an impending change, in the tax laws of the United States or any State within the
United States). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be binding upon all af fected Participants) and
their Beneficiaries, but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited at that time to any Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account. If this
Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), the termination resolution shall provide for how amounts theretofore credited to af fected Participants’ ARC
Equalization Accounts will be distributed.
(b) This Section is subject to the same restrictions related to compliance with Section 409A that apply to Section 9.1. In accordance with these restrictions,
the Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to terminate the Plan and make distributions in connection with a Change in Control
(as defined in Section 409A), and the maximum flexibility with respect to how and to what extent to carry this out following a Change in Control (as
defined in Section 409A) as is permissible under Section 409A. The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms under which a distribution may be
made in connection with any Change in Control with respect to deferrals made under this 409A Program.
31
ARTICLE X – MISCELLANEOUS
10.1    Limitation on Participant Rights.
Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be retained in the Employer's or Company's employ (or any right or interest in this Plan or any
assets of the Company or Employer other than as herein provided). The Company and Employer reserve the right to terminate the employment of any
Participant without any liability for any claim against the Company or Employer under this Plan, except for a claim for payment of benefits as provided herein.
10.2    Unfunded Obligation of Individual Employer .
The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from the general assets of the Participant’ s
individual Employer . Nothing contained in this Plan requires the Company or Employer to set aside or hold in trust any amounts or assets for the purpose of
paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant, Beneficiary , nor any other person shall have any property interest, legal or equitable, in any specific
Employer asset. This Plan creates only a contractual obligation on the part of a Participant’ s individual Employer , and the Participant has the status of a general
unsecured creditor of his or her Employer with respect to benefits granted hereunder . Such a Participant shall not have any preference or priority over , the rights
of any other unsecured general creditor of the Employer . No other Employer guarantees or shares such obligation, and no other Employer shall have any liability
to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary . In the event a Participant transfers from the employment of one Employer to another , the former Employer shall
transfer the liability for benefits made while the Participant was employed by that Employer to the new Employer (and the books of both Employers shall be
adjusted appropriately).
10.3    Other Benefit Plans.
This Plan shall not af fect the right of any Eligible Employee or Participant to participate in and receive benefits under and in accordance with the provisions of
any other employee benefit plans which are now or hereafter maintained by any Employer , unless
32
the terms of such other employee benefit plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it would cause such other plan to violate a requirement for tax-favored
treatment.
10.4    Receipt or Release.
Any payment to a Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against
the Plan Administrator , the Employer and the Company , and the Plan Administrator may require such Participant or Beneficiary , as a condition precedent to
such payment, to execute a receipt and release to such ef fect.
10.5    Governing Law .
This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in accordance with ERISA and, to the extent not preempted by ERISA, in accordance
with the laws of the State of New Y ork. If any provisions of this instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully ef fective.
10.6    Adoption of Plan by Related Employers.
The Plan Administrator may select as an Employer any division of the Company , as well as any member of the PepsiCo Or ganization, and permit or cause such
division or or ganization to adopt the Plan. The selection by the Plan Administrator shall govern the ef fective date of the adoption of the Plan by such related
Employer . The requirements for Plan adoption are entirely within the discretion of the Plan Administrator and, in any case where the status of an entity as an
Employer is at issue, the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be absolutely conclusive.
10.7    Rules of Construction.
The provisions of this Plan shall be construed according to the following rules:
(a) Gender and Number . Whenever the context so indicates, the singular or plural number and the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall be deemed to
include the other (or others).
33
(b) Examples . Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a
similar ef fect, such passage of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to
such passage in a manner that avoids limitation on its breadth of application).
(c) Compounds of the W ord “Here” . The words "hereof", “herein”, "hereunder" and other similar compounds of the word "here" shall mean and refer to the
entire Plan, not to any particular provision or section.
(d) Effect of Specific References . Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion shall create no inference that the Plan
Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provisions, is less complete or broad.
(e) Subdivisions of the Plan Document . This Plan document is divided and subdivided using the following progression: articles, sections, subsections,
paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a
decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower -case letters in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numbers in parentheses.
Subparagraphs are designated by lower -case roman numerals in parenthesis. Clauses are designated by upper -case letters in parentheses. Any reference
in a section to a subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified designation
contained in that same section. A similar reading shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a subsection and subparagraph references within
a paragraph.
(f) Invalid Provisions . If any provision of this Plan is, or is hereafter declared to be void, voidable, invalid or otherwise unlawful, the remainder of the Plan
shall not be af fected thereby .
34
10.8    Successors and Assigns; Nonalienation of Benefits.
This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided, however , that the amounts credited to
the ARC Equalization Account of a Participant are not (except as provided in Sections 5.5) subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer ,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance, char ge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to anticipate, alienate,
sell, transfer , assign, pledge, encumber , char ge or otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits payable hereunder , including, without limitation, any assignment
or alienation in connection with a separation, divorce, child support or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the Company or
any Employer . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator reserves the right to make payments in accordance with a divorce decree, judgment or
other court order as and when cash payments are made in accordance with the terms of this Plan from the ARC Equalization Account of a Participant. Any such
payment shall be char ged against and reduce the Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account.
10.9    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the Plan Administrator's opinion, a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to receive any payment hereunder is under a legal disability or is
incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his or her financial af fairs, the Plan Administrator may direct the Employer to make payments to such
person or to the legal representative of such person for his or her benefit, or to apply the payment for the benefit of such person in such manner as the Plan
Administrator considers advisable. Any payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making
of such payment to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan.
35

employees within the meaning of ERISA sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1). The plan provides benefits for Savings Plan participants in excess of the limitations
imposed by Code section 401(a)(17) on benefits under the Savings Plan (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan).
11.3    Allocation of Benefits Among Plans.

APPENDIX A – MERGER OF PGB SUPPLEMENT AL SA VINGS PLAN
A.1    Scope.
This Article sets forth special provisions applicable to amounts earned under the PBG Supplemental Savings Plan (“PBG Plan”) prior to the mer ger of that plan
with and into this Plan. Amounts earned under the PBG Plan prior to the mer ger shall be credited to a subaccount of the Participant’ s ARC Equalization
Account (“PBG Plan Subaccount”). All other defined terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term under Article II unless otherwise
indicated.
A.2    Pr ovisions Applicable to Amounts Earned Under PBG Plan.
Except as otherwise set forth in this Section A.2, the terms and conditions applicable to a Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount are governed by the prior
document for the PBG Plan.
(a) Investment Mapping . A Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount shall be mapped to the phantom investment options that are available for Equalized
Automatic Retirement Contributions under Article V of this Plan according to the same mapping method that will apply for purposes of transferring the
Participants’ account balance under the PBG Savings Plan to the investment options available under the Savings Plan, except as otherwise provided by
the Plan Administrator . Once the Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount balance has been mapped as provided in the preceding sentence, the PBG Plan
Subaccount shall be subject to the investment provisions set forth in Article V .
(b) Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund . Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the portion of a Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount that is invested in the
phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund shall not be subject to mapping, but instead shall remain invested in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund
until such time as the Participant makes a reinvestment election. Thereafter , such portion of the Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount shall remain eligible
for investment and reinvestment in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund
38
(notwithstanding any restrictions on investment in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund that may apply generally under Article V) in accordance
with procedures established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose.
(c) Time and Form of Payment . A Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount shall be paid on the first day of the calendar month following the Distribution
Valuation Date that next follows the earliest of the following:
(1) The Participant’ s Separation from Service;
(2) The Participant’ s death; or
(3) A change in control of the Participant’ s Employer (other than the successor to the Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc.), as defined in Section 409A.
Distributions upon Separation from Service under this subsection shall be subject to Section 6.5 (Delay for Key Employees), except that no priority shall
be given to Section 6.4.
(d) Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund Restrictions. To the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Rule 16b-3(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Act”), the Company may arrange for tracking of any such transaction defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(1) of the Act involving the phantom PepsiCo
Common Stock Fund and the Company may bar any such transaction to the extent it would not be exempt under Rule 16b-3(f). The Company will
impose blackout periods pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 whenever the Company determines that circumstances warrant.
Further , the Company may impose quarterly blackout periods on insider trading in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund as need (as determined by
the Company), timed to coincide with the release of the Company’ s quarterly earnings reports. The commencement and termination of these blackout
periods in each quarter , the parties to which they apply and the activities they restrict shall be as set forth in the of ficial insider trading policy
promulgated by the Company from time to time.
39
(e)    Impact of Securities Law on Distributions. The provisions of (d) above and this subparagraph (e), shall apply in determining whether a
Participant’ s distribution shall be delayed beyond the date applicable under Article VI of the Plan.
(i)    In General. This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the Act. Accordingly , in the case of a deferral or other
action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e) of the Act, if it were approved by the Company’ s Board
of Directors or the Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that the Plan shall be administered by delegates of the Compensation
Committee, in the case of a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act, in a manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any
additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the maximum possible extent.
(ii)    Approval of Distributions. This subsection shall govern the distribution of a deferral that (i) is wholly or partly invested in the Phantom
PepsiCo Common Stock Fund at the time the deferral would be valued to determine the amount of cash to be distributed to a Participant, (ii) was not
covered by an agreement, made at the time of the Participant’ s original phantom investment election, that any investments in the phantom PepsiCo
Common Stock Fund would, once made, remain in that fund until distribution, (iii) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act at the
time the interest in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would be liquidated in connection with the distribution, and (iv) if paid at the time the
distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in a violation of Section 16 of the Act because there is an opposite way
transaction that would be matched with the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund (either as a
“discretionary transaction,” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular transaction, as applicable) (a “Covered Distribution”). In the case of
a Covered Distribution, if the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the
40
phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution has not received Board Approval by the time the distribution would be made
if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then the actual distribution to the Participant shall be delayed only until the
earlier of:
(1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in
the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution, and
(2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the Participant is no longer subject to Section 16
of the Act, when the balance related to the distribution is no longer invested in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund, or when the time
between the liquidation and an opposite way transaction is suf ficient.

ARTICLE I – INTRODUCTION
PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") established the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program (the “Plan”) to permit Eligible Directors to defer certain compensation paid
to them as Directors.
The Plan consists of two primary components, each of which is subject to separate documentation: (i) deferrals under the Plan that were earned and vested prior
to the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear (the “Pre-409A Program”), and (ii) and deferrals under the Plan that were not earned and vested prior to the 2004-2005
Compensation Y ear (the “409A Program”). The 409A Program is governed by this document. The Pre-409A Program is governed by a separate set of documents.
Except as otherwise provided herein, this document reflects the provisions in ef fect from and after January 1, 2005, and the rights and benefits of individuals who are
Participants in the Plan from and after that date (and of those claiming through or on behalf of such individuals) shall be governed by the provisions of this document in
the case of actions and events occurring on or after January 1, 2005, with respect to deferrals that are subject to the 409A Program. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the term “actions and events” shall include all distribution trigger events and dates. The rights and benefits with respect to persons who only participated in
the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the Pre-409A Program documents that were in ef fect at such time, and shall not be
governed by the 409A Program documents.
The Plan was restated on March 10, 201 1. This restatement amended the Plan’ s rules regarding installment payment options by (i) adding a 10-year installment
payment option to the Plan, and (ii) eliminating the prohibition on the payment of installments after a Participant has attained age 80. The restatement also extended the
minimum deferral period for elective deferrals to the first day of the Plan Y ear following the date that is 12 months after the date the Director Compensation would
otherwise be payable to the Participant. All of these changes are ef fective for deferral elections made on and after March 1 1, 201 1.
The document for the 409A Program was restated as of September 19, 2012. This restatement reflected changes in the Company’ s payment of Retainer
Compensation, which shifted from payment annually in advance (on each October 1) to semiannually in arrears (with the first payment in arrears to be made in
December 2013 for services as a Director during the period June 1, 2013 to November 30, 2013).
The document for the 409A Program was most recently restated as of February 2, 2017. This restat ement reflected the shift in responsibility of reviewing and
reporting on director compensation from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to the Compensation Committee approved by the Board of Directors
on November 17, 2016.
Together , the documents for the 409A Program and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single plan. However , amounts subject to
the terms of this 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the
Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are
1
intended to permit the Pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A and the administration of the Plan shall be consistent with this intent.
For federal income tax purposes, the Plan is intended to be a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan that is unfunded and unsecured. For purposes of
ERISA, the Plan is intended to be exempt from ERISA coverage as a plan that solely benefits non-employees (or alternatively , a plan described in Sections 201(2),
301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of management or highly compensated employees).

ARTICLE IV – DEFERRAL OF COMPENSA TION

(a)    Each Eligible Director may make an election to defer under the Plan in 10% increments up to 100% of his or her Retainer Compensation for an
applicable period in the manner described in Section 4.02. Such election to defer shall apply to Retainer Compensation in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below ,
whichever applies as of the time in question.
(1)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning on or after October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a Director joining the Board after 201 1), a
Director ’s deferral election shall apply to Retainer Compensation that, in the absence of a deferral election, would be paid to the Director during a single
calendar year . A newly Eligible Director may only defer the portion of his or her Retainer Compensation, which otherwise would be payable in the calendar
year in which he or she becomes an Eligible Director , to the extent that it is earned for services performed after the date of his or her election. For this purpose,
if a valid Election Form is received prior to the date on which the Eligible Director becomes a Director and the Election Form is ef fective under Section 4.02 as
of the date on which the Eligible Director becomes a Director , then the Director shall be deemed to earn all of his or her Retainer Compensation for the calendar
year in which he or she becomes an Eligible Director after the date of the election; otherwise, only Retainer Compensation earned for months that begin after
when the newly Eligible Director ’s Election Form is received are subject to deferral. Any Retainer Compensation deferred by an Eligible Director for a calendar
year will be deducted on each payment date during the calendar year for which he or she has Retainer Compensation and is an Eligible Director . In accordance
with the default rule in T reasury Regulation § 1.409A-2(a)(13), Retainer Compensation that is paid – (i) following the end of a calendar year (in accordance
with normal payment timing arrangements for the payroll period that contains the last day of such calendar year), and (ii) for services performed during such

accordance with a deferral election for such following calendar year).
(2)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning before October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a Director joining the Board after 201 1), a
Director ’s deferral election shall apply to Retainer Compensation that is earned for services performed in the corresponding Compensation Y ear. A newly
Eligible Director may only defer the portion of his or her eligible Retainer Compensation for the Compensation Y ear in which he or she becomes an Eligible
Director that is earned for services performed after the date of his or her election. For this purpose, if a valid Election Form is received prior to the date on which
the Eligible Director becomes a Director and the Election Form is ef fective under Section 4.02 as of the date on which the Eligible Director becomes a Director ,
then the Director shall be deemed to receive all of his or her Retainer Compensation for the Compensation Y ear in which he or she becomes an Eligible Director
after the date of the election. Any Retainer Compensation deferred by an Eligible Director for a Compensation Y ear will be deducted for each payment period
during the Compensation Y ear for which he or she has Retainer Compensation and is an Eligible Director . Retainer
12
Compensation paid after the end of a Compensation Y ear for services performed during such initial Compensation Y ear shall be treated as Director
Compensation for services performed during such initial Compensation Y ear.

information that may be requested by the Plan Administrator from time to time. In addition, the Election Form must meet the requirements of Section 4.02.

Director ’s deferral election for Retainer Compensation shall be made no later than November 15 of the calendar year that immediately precedes the calendar
year in which such Retainer Compensation would be paid in the absence of a deferral election. If November 15 of such calendar year is not a business day , then
the deferral election must be made by the first business day following November 15 of such year . A newly Eligible Director may submit an Election Form (i)
prior to becoming an Eligible Director , or (ii) on or after becoming an Eligible Director , but any form submitted must be received within 30 days of when he or
she first becomes an Eligible Director (and such Election Form will be ef fective immediately upon receipt or , if later , the commencement of the individual’ s
status as an Eligible Director).
(2)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning before October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a Director joining the Board after 201 1), a
Director ’s deferral election for Retainer Compensation earned for services performed in a Compensation Y ear shall be made no later than December 31 of the
calendar year immediately prior to the beginning of the Compensation Y ear (although the Plan Administrator may adopt policies that encourage or require
earlier submission of election forms). If December 31 of such year is not a business day , then the deadline for deferral elections will be the first business day
preceding December 31 of such year . In addition, an individual, who has been nominated for Director status, must submit an Election Form prior to becoming
an Eligible Director or otherwise prior to rendering services as an Eligible Director , and such Election Form will be ef fective immediately upon commencement
of the individual’ s status as an Eligible Director or otherwise upon commencement of his or her services as an Eligible Director .
(b)    General Provisions . A separate deferral election under subsection (a) above must be made by an Eligible Director in accordance with paragraph
(1) or (2) below , whichever applies as of the time in question.
13
(1)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning on or after October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a Director joining the Board after 201 1), a
separate deferral election under subsection (a) above must be made by an Eligible Director for each calendar year ’s Retainer Compensation. If a properly
completed and executed Election Form is not actually received by the Plan Administrator (or , if authorized by the Plan Administrator for this purpose, the
Recordkeeper) by the time prescribed in subsection (a)(1) above, the Eligible Director will be deemed to have elected not to defer any Retainer Compensation
for the applicable calendar year . Except as provided in the next sentence, an election is irrevocable once received and determined by the Plan Administrator to
be properly completed (and such determination shall be made not later than the last date for making the election in question). Increases or decreases in the
amount or percentage an Eligible Director elects to defer for a calendar year shall not be permitted from and after the beginning of the calendar year to which
the deferral election applies (or in the case of a Newly Eligible Director ’s first calendar year , from and after the ef fective date of his or her deferral election for
such calendar year). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if an Eligible Director receives a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency pursuant
to Section 6.06, the Plan Administrator may cancel the Eligible Director ’s deferral election for the calendar year in which such distribution occurs. If an election
is cancelled because of a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency , such cancellation shall permanently apply to the deferral election for such
calendar year , and the Director may be eligible to make a new deferral election only for a subsequent calendar year (and only as permitted by the rules in
Sections 4.01 and 4.02).
(2)    Effective for Compensation Y ears beginning before October 1, 2013 (October 1, 2012, for a Director joining the Board after 201 1), a
separate deferral election under subsection (a) above must be made by an Eligible Director for each Compensation Y ear’s Retainer Compensation that is eligible
for deferral. If a properly completed and executed Election Form is not actually received by the Plan Administrator (or , if authorized by the Plan Administrator
for this purpose, the Recordkeeper) by the time prescribed in subsection (a)(2) above, the Eligible Director will be deemed to have elected not to defer any
Retainer Compensation for the applicable Compensation Y ear. Except as provided in the next sentence, an election is irrevocable once received and determined
by the Plan Administrator to be properly completed (and such determination shall be made not later than the last date for making the election in question).
Increases or decreases in the amount or percentage an Eligible Director elects to defer shall not be permitted from and after the beginning of the calendar year
during which the applicable Compensation Y ear begins (or in the case of a Newly Eligible Director ’s first Compensation Y ear, from and after the date he or she
becomes an Eligible Director); provided that if an Eligible Director receives a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency pursuant to Section 6.06,
the Plan Administrator may cancel the Eligible Director ’s deferral election for the year in which such distribution occurs. If an election is cancelled because of a
distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency , such cancellation shall permanently apply to the deferral election for such year , and the Director may
be eligible to make a new deferral election only for a subsequent year (and only as permitted by the rules in Sections 4.01 and 4.02).
14
(c)    Beneficiaries . A Participant may designate on the Election Form (or in some other manner authorized by the Plan Administrator) one or more
Beneficiaries to receive payment, in the event of his or her death, of the amounts credited to his or her Account; provided that, to be ef fective, any Beneficiary
designation must be in writing, signed by the Participant, and must meet such other standards (including any requirement for spousal consent) as the Plan Administrator
shall require from time to time. The Beneficiary designation must also be filed with the Plan Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator
for this purpose) prior to the Participant’ s death. An incomplete Beneficiary designation, as determined by the Plan Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by
the Plan Administrator for this purpose), shall be void and of no ef fect. In determining whether a Beneficiary designation that relates to the Plan is in ef fect, unrevoked
designations that were received under the Pre-409A Program or prior to the Ef fective Date shall be considered. A Beneficiary designation of an individual by name
remains in ef fect regardless of any change in the designated individual’ s relationship to the Participant. Any Beneficiary designation submitted to the Plan
Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator for this purpose) that only specifies a Beneficiary by relationship shall not be considered an
effective Beneficiary designation and shall be void and of no ef fect. If more than one Beneficiary is specified and the Participant fails to indicate the respective
percentage applicable to two or more Beneficiaries, then each Beneficiary for whom a percentage is not designated will be entitled to an equal share of the portion of
the Account (if any) for which percentages have not been designated. At any time, a Participant may change a Beneficiary designation for his or her Account in a
writing that is signed by the Participant and filed with the Plan Administrator (or Recordkeeper , if designated by the Plan Administrator for this purpose) prior to the
Participant’ s death, and that meets such other standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time. An individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary with
respect to a Participant’ s Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all payments have been made from the Account.
4.03     Period of Deferral; Form of Payment :
(a)    Period of Deferral . An Eligible Director making a deferral election shall specify a deferral period on his or her Election Form by designating
either a Specific Payment Date or the date he or she incurs a Separation from Service. Solely for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible Director ’s Specific
Payment Date shall not be later than his or her 80th birthday (and the specification of such a later date shall be deemed instead to specify the Director ’s 80th birthday as
the Specific Payment Date). In addition, an Eligible Director shall be deemed to have elected a period of deferral of not less than the first day of the Plan Y ear after (i)
for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, the date that is 12 months after the date the Retainer Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral, and (ii) for
elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, the end of the Plan Y ear during which the Director Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral. If the Specific
Payment Date selected by an Eligible Director would result in a period of deferral that is less than the minimum, the Eligible Director shall be deemed to have selected
a Specific Payment Date equal to the minimum period of deferral as provided in the preceding sentence. If an Eligible Director fails to af firmatively designate a period
of deferral on his or her Election Form, he or she shall be deemed to have specified the date on which he or she incurs a Separation from Service.
15
(b)    Form of Payment . This subsection (b) is ef fective for elective deferral elections filed for Compensation Y ears beginning from and after October 1,
2009; see the Appendix for rules applicable prior to that date.
(1)    Elections on or After March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible Director making a deferral
election shall specify a form of payment on his or her Election Form by designating either a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a
period 5 or 10 years.
(2)    Elections Prior to March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible Director making a deferral election
shall specify a form of payment on his or her Election Form by designating either a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period
of 5 years but not later than the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday . If the Eligible Director elects installment payments and the installments would otherwise
extend beyond the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday , such election shall be treated as an election for installments over a period of whole and partial years that
ends on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday; provided that the amounts to be distributed in connection with the installments prior to the Eligible Director ’s 80th
birthday shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.08 by assuming that the installments shall continue for the full number of installments with the entire
remaining amount of the relevant Deferral Subaccount distributed on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday .
If an Eligible Director fails to make a form of payment election for a deferral under paragraphs (1) or (2) above, he or she shall be deemed to have elected a lump sum
payment. Initial form of payment elections for Mandatory Deferrals are governed by Section 4.05.
4.04     Second Look Election :
(a)    General . Subject to Subsection (b) below , a Participant who has made a valid initial deferral in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
Article may subsequently make another one-time election regarding the time and/or form of payment of his or her deferral. This opportunity to modify the Participant’ s
initial election is referred to as a “Second Look Election.”
(b)    Requirements for Second Look Elections . A Second Look Election must be made on an Election Form that the Plan Administrator provides for
this purpose, and it must comply with all of the following requirements:
(1)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment based on a Specific Payment Date, the Participant may only make a Second Look
Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s original Specific Payment Date. In addition, in this case the Participant’ s Second Look
Election must provide for a new Specific Payment Date that is at least 5 years after the original Specific Payment Date. For Second Look Elections made prior
to March 1 1, 201 1, if the Specific Payment Date applicable pursuant to the Second Look Election is after the Participant’ s 80th birthday , either by the
Participant’ s choice or if necessary to comply with the 5-year rule stated above, the Second Look Election is void.
16
(2)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment based on the Participant’ s Separation from Service, the Participant may only make a
Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’ s Separation from Service. In addition, in this case the Participant must
elect a new Specific Payment Date that turns out to be at least 5 years after the Participant’ s Separation from Service. If the new Specific Payment Date selected
in the Second Look Election turns out to be less than five years after the Participant’ s Separation from Service, the Second Look Election is void.
(3)    A Participant may make only one Second Look Election for each individual deferral, and each Second Look Election must comply with
all of the relevant requirements of this Section.
(4)    A Participant who uses a Second Look Election to change the form of the Participant’ s payment from a lump sum to installments shall be
subject to the rules for installment payment elections in Sections 4.03(b)(1) and (2), and such installment payments must begin no earlier than 5 years after when
the lump sum payment would have been paid based upon the Participant’ s initial election.
(5)    If a Participant’ s initial election specified payment in the form of installments and the Participant wants to elect instead payment in a
lump sum, the earliest payment date of the lump sum must be no earlier than 5 years after the first payment date that applied under the Participant’ s initial
installment election.
(6)    For purposes of this Section and compliance with Section 409A, all of a Participant’ s installment payments related to a specific deferral
election shall be treated as a single payment.
A Second Look Election will be void and payment will be made based on the Participant’ s original election under Section 4.03 if all of the relevant provisions of
this subsection (b) are not satisfied in full. However , if a Participant’ s Second Look Election becomes ef fective in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b), the
Participant’ s original election shall be superseded (including any Specific Payment Date specified therein), and the original election shall not be taken into account with
respect to the deferral that is subject to the Second Look Election.
(c)    Plan Administrator ’s Role . Each Participant has the sole responsibility to elect a Second Look Election by contacting the Plan Administrator (or , if
authorized by the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper) and to comply with the requirements of this Section. The Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may provide
a notice of a Second Look Election opportunity to some or all Participants, but the Recordkeeper and Plan Administrator is under no obligation to provide such notice
(or to provide it to all Participants, in the event a notice is provided only to some Participants). The Recordkeeper and the Plan Administrator have no discretion to
waive or otherwise modify any requirement for a Second Look Election set forth in this Section or in Section 409A.
17
4.05     Mandatory Deferrals:
(a)    General . As provided in this Section, the Board of Directors of the Company may require that Director Compensation be deferred under the Plan.
Such portion of an Eligible Director ’s Director Compensation that the Board of Directors of the Company requires to be deferred under this Section 4.05 shall be
referred to as a “Mandatory Deferral.”
(b)    Time for Committee’ s Determination . To be ef fective hereunder , any determination by the Board of Directors of the Company to require a
Mandatory Deferral of a portion of an Eligible Director ’s Director Compensation must be made no later than the December 31 immediately preceding the calendar year
in which the Eligible Director performs the services to which such Director Compensation relates (or , to the extent the Eligible Director is not permitted to make any
payment election with respect to such Mandatory Deferral and it would result in a later deadline, immediately prior to the time the Eligible Director first has a legally
binding right to such Director Compensation). As of such date or time, the determination by the Board of Directors of the Company to require the deferral of the
Director Compensation shall be irrevocable. Any Mandatory Deferral shall be credited to a separate Deferral Subaccount that is maintained for such Mandatory
Deferral.
(c)    Current Mandatory Deferrals . Pursuant to a September 14, 2007 resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company , a Mandatory Deferral of
$150,000 shall be credited as of October 1 of each year to each individual who is an Eligible Director on such October 1, commencing with a Mandatory Deferral on
October 1, 2007; provided that (1) a Director newly appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company shall be credited with a pro-rated Mandatory
Deferral as of the commencement date of his or her status as a Director , with such pro-rated amount determined by multiplying such Mandatory Deferral by the ratio of
the number of full and partial quarters remaining during the Applicable 12-Month Period (as defined below) as of such commencement date over four , and (2) the
Board of Directors of the Company retains the discretion to change the amount subject to Mandatory Deferral or eliminate Mandatory Deferrals entirely with respect to
Applicable 12-Month Periods after the 2007-2008 Compensation Y ear. At the same time, any such discretion shall not alter the determination to defer Director
Compensation to the extent such determination has become irrevocable with respect to specific Director Compensation in accordance with subsection (b) above.
However , the preceding sentence shall not limit the discretion of the Company’ s Board of Directors to forfeit outright specific Director Compensation. For purposes of
this Section, “Applicable 12-Month Period” shall mean the 12-month period that begins on October 1 of a year and ends on September 30 of the following year .
(d)    Time and Form of Payment . Each Mandatory Deferral shall be distributed in accordance with Section 6.07. The Eligible Director shall specify the
form of payment of each of his or her Mandatory Deferrals in accordance with the following:
(1)    Elections on or After March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made on or after March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible Director shall designate either
a lump sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 or 10 years.
18
(2)    Elections Prior to March 1 1, 201 1. Effective for elections made prior to March 1 1, 201 1, an Eligible Director shall designate either a lump
sum payment or annual installment payments to be paid over a period of 5 years. Installments are not available if the first installment would begin on or after the
Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday . If the Eligible Director elects installment payments and the installments would otherwise begin before and extend beyond the
Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday , such election shall be treated as an election for installments over a period of whole and partial years that ends on the Eligible
Director ’s 80th birthday; provided that the amounts to be distributed in connection with the installments prior to the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday shall be
determined in accordance with Section 6.08 by assuming that the installments shall continue for the full number of installments, with the entire remaining
amount of the relevant Deferral Subaccount distributed on the Eligible Director ’s 80th birthday . No such election shall be permitted for the Mandatory Deferral
for the 2007-2008 Compensation Y ear.
If permitted under paragraphs (1) or (2) above, an Eligible Director shall make a form of payment election with respect to a Mandatory Deferral no later than December
31 immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Eligible Director provides the services to which the Mandatory Deferral relates (although the Plan
Administrator may adopt policies that encourage or require earlier submission of election forms). In addition, an individual shall not be eligible to make a form of
payment election for a Mandatory Deferral granted to an individual for his first Applicable 12-Month Period as an Eligible Director , unless such individual submits the
election prior to becoming an Eligible Director or otherwise prior to rendering services as an Eligible Director , and then such election shall be ef fective immediately
upon commencement of the individual’ s status as an Eligible Director or otherwise upon commencement of his or her services as an Eligible Director . If an Eligible
Director does not (or is not permitted to) make a form of payment election for a Mandatory Deferral, the Mandatory Deferral shall be paid in a lump sum. The Eligible
Director shall be entitled to elect to change the time and form of payment in accordance with Section 4.04 only to the extent expressly permitted by the Board of
Directors.
19
ARTICLE V – INTERESTS OF P ARTICIP ANTS
5.01     Accounting for Participants’ Interests :
(a)    Deferral Subaccounts . Each Participant shall have at least one separate Deferral Subaccount for each separate deferral of Director Compensation
made by or for the Participant under this Plan. A Participant’ s deferral shall be credited as of the date of the deferral to his or her Account as soon as administratively
practicable following the date the compensation would be paid in the absence of a deferral (or as specified in Section 4.05, in the case of a Mandatory Deferral). A
Participant’ s Account is a bookkeeping device to track the value of the Participant’ s deferrals and the Company’ s liability therefor . No assets shall be reserved or
segregated in connection with any Account, and no Account shall be insured or otherwise secured.
(b)    Account Earnings or Losses . As of each V aluation Date, a Participant’ s Account shall be credited with earnings and gains (and shall be debited for
expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to the Participant’ s Account had actually been invested in accordance with this Article. The Plan provides
only for “phantom investments,” and therefore such earnings, gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual. However , they shall be applied to measure the
value of a Participant’ s Account and the amount of the Company’ s liability to make deferred payments to or on behalf of the Participant.
5.02     Phantom Investment of Account :
(a)    General . Each of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts shall be invested on a phantom basis as provided in this Section.
(1)    Participants Who Are Currently Directors . The Deferral Subaccounts of a Participant who is currently a Director shall be invested on a
phantom basis solely in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to subsection (b) below .
(2)    All Other Participants . Not before the later of a Participant’ s diversification date (as defined below) and March 1 1, 201 1, the Deferral
Subaccounts of a Participant who ceases to be a Director may be invested on a phantom basis in any combination of phantom investment options specified by
the Participant (or following the Participant’ s death, by his or her Beneficiary) from the option in subsection (b) and those options of fered by the Plan
Administrator under subsection (c) below for this purpose from time to time. A Participant’ s diversification date shall be the first day of the calendar quarter
beginning after the first anniversary of when he or she ceases to be a Director . Prior to the later of a Participant’ s diversification date and March 1 1, 201 1, the
Deferral Subaccounts of a Participant who ceases to be a Director shall be invested on a phantom basis solely in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to subsection
(b) below . The ef fective date of an investment election that is permissible under this subsection is determined under subsection (d) below .
(3)    Participants Who Return to Director Status . If a former Director subsequently returns to Director status, deferrals made during the period
prior to his or
20
her return to Director status shall be subject to paragraph (2) above, and deferrals made during the period in which he or she is again a Director shall be subject
to paragraph (1) above.
(b)    Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock . Participant Accounts invested in this phantom option are adjusted to reflect an investment in PepsiCo
Common Stock. An amount deferred into this option is converted to phantom shares (or units) of PepsiCo Common Stock of equivalent value by dividing such amount
by the Fair Market V alue of a share of PepsiCo Common Stock (or of a unit in the Account) on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this
option by the Plan Administrator . The Plan Administrator shall adopt a fair valuation methodology for valuing a phantom investment in this option, such that the value
shall reflect the complete value of an investment in PepsiCo Common Stock in accordance with the following paragraphs below .
(1)    The Plan Administrator shall value a phantom investment in PepsiCo Common Stock pursuant to an accounting methodology which
unitizes partial shares as well as any amounts that would be received by the Account as dividends (if dividends were paid on phantom shares/units of PepsiCo
Common Stock as they are on actual shares of equivalent value). For the time period this methodology is chosen, partial shares and the above dividends shall be
converted to units and credited to the Participant’ s investment in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock.
(2)    A Participant’ s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock is valued as of a V aluation Date by multiplying the number of phantom
shares (or units) credited to his or her Account on such date by the Fair Market V alue of a share of PepsiCo Common Stock (or of a unit in the Account) on such
date.
(3)    If shares of PepsiCo Common Stock change by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, mer ger, consolidation, spin-of f,
combination or exchange of shares or any other corporate change treated as subject to this provision by the Plan Administrator , such equitable adjustment shall
be made in the number and kind of phantom shares/units credited to an Account or Deferral Subaccount as the Plan Administrator may determine to be
necessary or appropriate.
(4)    In no event will shares of PepsiCo Common Stock actually be purchased or held under this Plan, and no Participant shall have any rights
as a shareholder of PepsiCo Common Stock on account of an interest in this phantom option.
(c)    Other Funds . From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate which (if any) other investment options shall be available as phantom
investment options under the Plan. These phantom investment options shall be described in materials provided to Participants from time to time. Any of these phantom
investment options shall be administered under procedures implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator . Unless otherwise specified in these materials or
procedures, in the case of any such phantom investment option that is based on a unitized fund, an amount deferred or transferred into such option is converted to
phantom units in the applicable fund of equivalent value by dividing such amount by the NA V of a unit in such fund on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is
treated as invested in this
21
option by the Plan Administrator . Thereafter , a Participant’ s interest in each such phantom option is valued as of a V aluation Date (or a Distribution V aluation Date) by
multiplying the number of phantom units credited to his or her Account on such date by the NA V of a unit in such fund on such date. The Plan Administrator may
discontinue any phantom investment option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for transferring a Participant’ s phantom investment from the
discontinued option to a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects another replacement option in accordance with such requirements as the Plan
Administrator may apply).
(d)    Fund T ransfers . A Participant may reallocate previously deferred amounts in a Deferral Subaccount (to the extent subsection (c)’ s phantom
investment options are available for such amounts) by properly completing and submitting a fund transfer form provided by the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper
and specifying, in one percent increments, the reallocation of his or her Deferral Subaccount among the phantom investment options then of fered by the Plan
Administrator for this purpose. (The rules relating to non-paper formats for Election Forms shall also apply to the fund transfer form.) If a fund transfer form provides
for investing less than or more than 100% of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount, it will be void and disregarded. Any transfer form that is not void under the
preceding sentence shall be ef fective as of the V aluation Date next occurring after its receipt by the Recordkeeper , but the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper may also
specify a minimum number of days in advance of which such transfer form must be received in order for the form to become ef fective as of such next V aluation Date. If
more than one fund transfer form is received on a timely basis, the form that the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper determines to be the most recent shall be followed.
(e)    Authority of Recordkeeper . Any valuation or other determination that is required to be made under this Section by the Plan Administrator may
also be made by the Recordkeeper , if the Recordkeeper has been authorized by the Plan Administrator to make such valuation or determination.
(f)    Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund Restrictions . Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section, the Plan Administrator may at any
time alter the ef fective date of any investment or allocation involving the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund pursuant to Section 7.03(j) (relating to safeguards
against insider trading). The Plan Administrator may also, to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Rule 16b-3(f) of the Act, arrange for tracking of any such
transaction defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(1) of the Act and bar any such transaction to the extent it would not be exempt under Rule 16b-3(f). The Company may also
impose blackout periods pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 whenever the Company determines that circumstances warrant. Further , the
Company may impose quarterly blackout periods on insider trading in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund as needed (as determined by the Company), timed to
coincide with the release of the Company’ s quarterly earnings reports. The commencement and termination of these blackout periods in each quarter , the parties to
which they apply and the activities they restrict shall be as set forth in the of ficial insider trading policy promulgated by the Company from time to time. These
provisions shall apply notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary except Section 7.07 (relating to compliance with Section 409A).
22
5.03     Vesting of a Participant’ s Account :
A Participant’ s interest in the value of his or her Account shall at all times be 100% vested, which means that it will not forfeit as a result of his or her
Separation from Service.
5.04     Prohibited Misconduct .
(a)    Effective for Mandatory Deferrals and elective deferrals of Director Compensation that are credited to the Plan during or subsequent to the 201 1-
2012 Compensation Y ear, a Participant who engages in “Prohibited Misconduct” shall, at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (and in addition
to any other remedies available to the Board and/or the Company), forfeit the entire amount in his or her Account attributable to – (i) Mandatory Deferrals of Director
Compensation that are credited to the Plan during or subsequent to the 201 1-2012 Compensation Y ear, including all current and future earnings and gains thereon, and
(ii) all current and future earnings and gains attributable to elective deferrals of Director Compensation that are credited to the Plan during or subsequent to the 201 1-
2012 Compensation Y ear.
(b)    For purposes of subsection (a) above, “Prohibited Misconduct” shall mean: (i) the use for profit or disclosure to unauthorized persons of
confidential information or trade secrets of the Company; (ii) the breach of any contract with the Company or violation of any obligation to the Company , including,
without limitation, a violation of the Company’ s Worldwide Code of Conduct; (iii) engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or of another
company based on information gained as a result of the Participant’ s position with the Company; or (iv) the commission of a felony or other serious crime. Nothing
contained in the Plan or in any other confidentiality provision to which the Participant may be subject as a result of the Participant serving as a Director , shall prohibit
the Participant from communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Company , participating in government
investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to government authorities.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its
attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.
23
ARTICLE VI – DISTRIBUTIONS
6.01     General :
A Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount(s) shall be distributed as provided in this Article, subject in all cases to Section 7.03(j) (relating to safeguards against
insider trading) and Section 7.06 (relating to compliance with Section 16 of the Act). All Deferral Subaccount balances shall be distributed in cash; provided, however ,
that ef fective for distributions made after September 12, 2008, the distribution of a Participant’ s interest in phantom PepsiCo Common Stock shall be paid in shares of
PepsiCo Common Stock which will be deemed to have been distributed under the PepsiCo, Inc. 2007 Long T erm Incentive Plan or any successor plan thereto and will
count against the limit on the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock available for distribution thereunder . If the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock to
be distributed is not a whole number of shares, the number of shares to be distributed will be rounded down to the closest whole number of shares and the remaining
amount will be paid in cash based on the Fair Market V alue of a share of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Distribution V aluation Date corresponding to the distribution.
In no event shall any portion of a Participant’ s Account be distributed earlier or later than is allowed under Section 409A. The following general rules shall apply for
purposes of interpreting the provisions of this Article VI.
(a)    Section 6.02 (Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a Specific Payment Date and
the Specific Payment Date is reached before the Participant’ s Disability or death. If such a Participant dies prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.04 shall apply
to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If such a Participant becomes Disabled prior to the Specific Payment Date,
Section 6.05 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(b)    Section 6.03 (Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a Separation from
Service and then the Participant Separates from Service (other than as a result of death). Subsections (c) and (d) of this Section provide for when Section 6.04 or 6.06
take precedence over Section 6.03.
(c)    Section 6.04 (Distributions on Account of Death) applies when the Participant dies. If a Participant is entitled to receive or is receiving a
distribution under Section 6.02 or 6.03 (see below) at the time of his or her death, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.04
would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(d)    Section 6.05 (Distributions on Account of Disability) applies when the Participant becomes Disabled. If a Participant who becomes Disabled dies,
Section 6.04 shall take precedence over Section 6.05 to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If a Participant is
entitled to receive or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02 or 6.03 at the time of his Disability , Section 6.05 shall take precedence over those sections to the
extent Section 6.05 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
24
(e)    Section 6.06 (Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency) applies when the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emer gency prior to
when a Participant’ s Account is distributed under Sections 6.02 through 6.05. In this case, the provisions of Section 6.06 shall take precedence over Sections 6.02
through 6.05 to the extent Section 6.06 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of the Participant’ s Account.
6.02     Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date :
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon the occurrence of a Specific Payment Date. In the event a Participant’ s Specific Payment Date
for a Deferral Subaccount is reached before (i) the Participant’ s Disability or (ii) the Participant’ s death, such Deferral Subaccount shall be distributed based on the
occurrence of such Specific Payment Date in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
(a)    If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of a lump sum pursuant to Sections 4.03 or 4.04, whichever is applicable, the
Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or immediately precedes the Specific Payment Date, and the resulting
amount shall be paid in a single lump sum on the Specific Payment Date.
(b)    If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of installments pursuant to Section 4.03 or 4.04, whichever is applicable, the
Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or immediately precedes the Specific Payment Date and the first
installment payment shall be paid on the Specific Payment Date. Thereafter , installment payments shall continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the
Participant on the Election Form or the Second Look Election (whichever is applicable, and subject in each case to the provisions of this Plan that constrain such
elections), except as provided in Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 (relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of
each installment shall be determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Subsection, if before the date the last installment distribution
is processed for payment the Participant would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to a distribution on account of death or
Disability), the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts that would otherwise be distributed based on such Specific Payment Date shall instead be
distributed in accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it would result
in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section 6.04 or 6.05.
6.03     Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service :
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon Separation from Service. When used in this Section, the phrase “Separation from Service”
shall only refer to a Separation from Service that is not for Disability or death.
(a)    If the Participant’ s Separation from Service is prior to the Specific Payment Date that is applicable to a Deferral Subaccount, the Participant’ s
deferral election pursuant to Sections 4.03 or 4.04 ( i.e., time and form of payment) shall continue to be given
25
effect, and the Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed based upon the provisions of Section 6.02.
(b)    If the Participant has selected payment of his or her deferral on account of Separation from Service, distribution of the related Deferral
Subaccount shall commence as follows:
(1)    for deferrals of Director Compensation other than Mandatory Deferrals, distribution of the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence
on the first day of the Plan Y ear following the end of the Plan Y ear in which the Participant’ s Separation from Service occurs; and
(2)    for Mandatory Deferrals, distribution of the related Deferral Subaccount shall commence on the first day of the calendar quarter
beginning after the first anniversary of the Participant’ s Separation from Service occurs.
(c)    The distribution provided in subsection (b) shall be made in either a single lump sum payment or in installment payments depending upon the
Participant’ s deferral election under Sections 4.03, 4.04 or 4.05. If the Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of a lump sum, the Deferral Subaccount shall be
valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or immediately precedes the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the resulting amount
shall be distributed in a lump sum on the date specified in subsection (b) above. If a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount is to be paid in the form of installments pursuant
to Section 4.03 or 4.04, whichever is applicable, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the last Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or immediately
precedes the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the first installment payment shall be paid on the date specified in subsection (b) above. Thereafter ,
installment payments shall continue in accordance with the schedule elected by the Participant on his/her deferral election form or Second Look Election (and subject in
each case to the provisions of this Plan that constrain such elections), except as provided in Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 (relating to distributions on account of death,
Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment shall be determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
Subsection, if before the date the last installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections
6.04 or 6.05 (relating to a distribution on account of death or Disability), the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts that would otherwise be
distributed based on such Separation from Service shall instead be distributed in accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or
Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section 6.04 or 6.05.
(d)    Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, if the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Separation
from Service (or at such other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall not be paid, as a
result of the Participant’ s Separation from Service, earlier than the date that is at least 6 months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service. In such event:
26
(1)    any applicable lump sum payment shall be valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date that corresponding to the date that is 6 months
after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the resulting amount shall be distributed on the date that is 6 months after the date of the
Participant’ s Separation from Service; and
(2)    any installment payments that would otherwise have been paid during such 6 month period shall be valued as of the Distribution
Valuation Date that corresponds to the date that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service pursuant to Section 6.08 and the resulting
amount(s) shall be distributed in a lump sum on the date that is 6 months after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service and the installment stream
shall continue from that point in accordance with the applicable schedule.
(e)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments for one or more Deferral Subaccounts in accordance with Section 6.02 at the time of his or her
Separation from Service, such installment payments shall continue to be paid based upon the Participant’ s deferral election (but subject to acceleration under Sections
6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
6.04     Distributions on Account of Death :
(a)    Upon a Participant’ s death, the Participant’ s Account under the Plan shall be valued as of the first Distribution V aluation Date of the first Plan
Year following the Participant’ s death and the resulting amount shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment on such date. If the Participant is receiving
installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s death, such installment payments shall continue in accordance with the terms of the Participant’ s deferral election
that governs such payments until the time that the lump sum payment is due to be paid under the provisions of the preceding sentence of this Subsection. Immediately
prior to the time that such lump sum payment is to be paid all installment payments shall cease and the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Account shall be
distributed at such scheduled payment time in a single lump sum. Amounts paid following a Participant’ s death, whether a lump sum or continued installments, shall be
paid to the Participant’ s Beneficiary . If some but not all of the persons designated as Beneficiaries by a Participant to receive his or her Account at death predecease the
Participant, the Participant’ s surviving Beneficiaries shall be entitled to the portion of the Participant’ s Account intended for such pre-deceased persons in proportion to
the surviving Beneficiaries’ respective shares.
(b)    If no designation is in ef fect at the time of a Participant’ s death (as determined by the Plan Administrator) or if all persons designated as
Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed as follows:
(1)    If the Participant is married at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Participant’ s
spouse; and
27
(2)    If the Participant is not married at the time of his/her death, all payments made pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Participant’ s
estate.
The Plan Administrator shall determine whether a Participant is “married” and shall determine a Participant’ s “spouse” based on the state or local law where the
Participant has his/her primary residence at the time of death. The Plan Administrator is authorized to make any applicable inquires and to request any documents,
certificates or other information that it deems necessary or appropriate in order to make the above determinations.
(c)    Prior to the time the value of the Participant’ s Account is distributed under this Section, the Participant’ s Beneficiary may apply for a distribution
under Section 6.06 (relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency).
(d)    Any claim to be paid any amounts standing to the credit of a Participant in connection with the Participant’ s death must be received by the
Recordkeeper or the Plan Administrator at least 14 days before any such amount is paid out by the Recordkeeper . Any claim received thereafter is untimely , and it shall
be unenforceable against the Plan, the Company , the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper or any other party acting for one or more of them.
6.05     Distributions on Account of Disability :
If a Participant incurs a Disability , the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section.
(a)    Prior to the time that an amount would become distributable under this Article, if a Participant believes he or she is suf fering from a Disability , the
Participant shall file a written request with the Recordkeeper for payment of the entire amount credited to his or her Account in connection with Disability . After a
Participant has filed a written request pursuant to this Section, along with all supporting material that may be required by the Recordkeeper from time to time, the
Recordkeeper shall determine within 45 days (or such other number of days as allowed by applicable law if special circumstances warrant additional time) whether the
Participant meets the criteria for a Disability . In addition, to the extent required under Section 409A, if the Company becomes aware that the Participant appears to meet
the criteria for a Disability , the Company shall advise the Recordkeeper and the Recordkeeper shall proceed to determine if the Participant meets the criteria for a
Disability under this Plan, even if the Participant has yet not applied for payment from this Plan. To the extent practicable, the Participant shall be expected to permit
whatever medical examinations are necessary for the Recordkeeper to make its determination. If the Recordkeeper determines that the Participant has satisfied the
criteria for a Disability , the Participant’ s Account shall be valued as of the Distribution V aluation Date that occurs on or immediately precedes the date on which the
Participant became Disabled and the resulting amount shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the Plan Y ear following the end of the Plan
Year in which the Disability determination is made.
(b)    If the Participant is receiving installment payments at the time of the Participant’ s Disability , such installment payments shall continue to be paid
in accordance with the provisions of the Participant’ s applicable deferral election until the time that the lump sum
28
payment is due to be paid under the provisions of Subsection (a). Immediately prior to the time that such lump sum payment is scheduled to be paid, all installment
payments shall cease and the remaining balance of the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed at the time specified in Subsection (a) in a single lump sum.
6.06     Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency :
Prior to the time that an amount would become distributable under Sections 6.02 through 6.05, a Participant or Beneficiary may file a written request with the
Recordkeeper for accelerated payment of all or a portion of the amount credited to the Participant’ s Account based upon an Unforeseeable Emer gency . After an
individual has filed a written request pursuant to this Section, along with all supporting material that may be required by the Recordkeeper from time to time, the
Recordkeeper shall determine within 60 days (or such other number of days that is necessary if special circumstances warrant additional time) whether the individual
meets the criteria for an Unforeseeable Emer gency . If the Recordkeeper determines that an Unforeseeable Emer gency has occurred, the Participant or Beneficiary shall
receive a distribution from his or her Account on the date that such determination is finalized by the Recordkeeper . However , such distribution shall not exceed the
dollar amount necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emer gency (plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution) after taking
into account the extent to which the Unforeseeable Emer gency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by
liquidation of the Participant’ s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).
6.07     Distributions of Mandatory Deferrals :
This Section 6.07 shall govern the distribution of all Mandatory Deferrals under the Plan. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.07, a Participant’ s
Deferral Subaccount(s) for Mandatory Deferrals shall be distributed upon the earliest of the following to occur:
(a)    The Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than on account of a Disability or death) pursuant to the distribution rules of Section 6.03;
(b)    The Participant’ s death pursuant to the distribution rules of Section 6.04;
(c)    The Participant’ s Disability pursuant to the distribution rules of Section 6.05; or
(d)    The occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emer gency with respect to the Participant pursuant to the distribution rules of Section 6.06.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may specify dif ferent terms for the distribution of Mandatory Deferrals. Such
specification may always occur not later than when the Mandatory Deferral becomes irrevocable under Section 4.05(c). Such specification may also occur later , but
only to the extent that such later specification satisfies the requirements of Section 4.04 (as if it were an election by the Participant). In addition, to the extent expressly
permitted by the Board of Directors, the Participant may make a Second Look Election under Section 4.04.
29
6.08     Valuation :
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Participant's Deferral Subaccount shall continue to be credited with
earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the Distribution V aluation Date that is used in determining the amount of the
distribution under this Article. If a particular Section in this Article does not specify a Distribution V aluation Date to be used in calculating the distribution, the
Participant's Deferral Subaccount shall continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V until the
Distribution V aluation Date on or most recently preceding the date of such distribution. In determining the value of a Participant’ s remaining Deferral Subaccount
following an installment distribution from the Deferral Subaccount (or a partial distribution under Section 6.06 relating to a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable
Emer gency), such distribution shall reduce the value of the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of the close of the Distribution V aluation Date on or most recently
preceding the payment date for such installment (or partial distribution). The amount to be distributed in connection with any installment payment shall be determined
by dividing the value of a Participant’ s Deferral Subaccount as of such Distribution V aluation Date (determined before reduction of the Deferral Subaccount as of such
Distribution V aluation Date in accordance with the preceding sentence) by the remaining number of installments to be paid with respect to the Deferral Subaccount.
6.09     Impact of Section 16 of the Act on Distributions :
The provisions of Section 7.06 shall apply in determining whether a Participant’ s distribution shall be delayed beyond the date applicable under the preceding
provisions of this Article VI.
6.10     Actual Payment Date :
An amount payable on a date specified in this Article VI shall be paid no later than the later of (a) the end of the calendar year in which the specified date
occurs, or (b) the 15th day of the third calendar month following such specified date. In addition, the Participant (or Beneficiary) is not permitted to designate the
taxable year of the payment.
30
ARTICLE VII – PLAN ADMINISTRA TION
7.01     Plan Administrator :
The Plan Administrator is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator has the authority to name one or more delegates to carry out
certain responsibilities hereunder , as specified in the definition of Plan Administrator . To the extent not already set forth in the Plan, any such delegation shall state the
scope of responsibilities being delegated and is subject to Section 7.06 below .
7.02     Action :
Action by the Plan Administrator may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Plan Administrator adopts from time to time or that the Company’ s Law
Department determines are legally permissible.
7.03     Powers of the Plan Administrator :
The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have (and shall be permitted to delegate) all powers necessary to accomplish that
purpose, including the following:
(a)    To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
(b)    To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility , participation and deferrals, to make allocations and
determinations required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants’ Accounts;
(c)    To compute and certify to the Company the amount and kinds of payments to Participants or their Beneficiaries, and to determine the time and
manner in which such payments are to be paid;
(d)    To authorize all disbursements by the Company pursuant to this Plan;
(e)    To maintain (or cause to be maintained) all the necessary records for administration of this Plan;
(f)    To make and publish such rules for the regulation of this Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms hereof;
(g)    To delegate to other individuals or entities from time to time the performance of any of its duties or responsibilities hereunder;
(h)    To change the phantom investment under Article V ;
(i)    To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal counsel to assist in operating and administering the Plan; and
31
(j)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan except Section 7.07 (relating to compliance with Section 409A), the Plan Administrator or the
Recordkeeper may take any action the Plan Administrator determines is necessary to assure compliance with any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as
may be in ef fect from time to time. Such actions may include altering the distribution date of Deferral Subaccounts. Any such actions shall alter the normal operation of
the Plan to the minimum extent necessary .
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits, to
determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan,
and its decisions on such matters will be final and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion
of the Plan Administrator , even if (1) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (2) a determination is not expressly called for by the
Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or call for a determination. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be
paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to them. In the event of a review by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal, any
exercise of the Plan Administrator ’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly shown to be arbitrary and capricious.
7.04     Compensation, Indemnity and Liability :
The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without compensation for services hereunder . All expenses of the Plan and the Plan Administrator will be
paid by the Company . To the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator , any such expense may be char ged against specific Participant Accounts, thereby
reducing the obligation of the Company . No member of the Board of Directors (who serves as the Plan Administrator), and no individual acting as the delegate of the
Board of Directors, shall be liable for any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or omission on his or her own part, excepting his or her
own willful misconduct. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Board of Directors and any employee of the Company (or a Company
affiliate, if recognized as an af filiate for this purpose by the Plan Administrator) acting as the delegate of the Board of Directors against any and all expenses and
liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising in connection with this Plan out of his or her membership on the Board of Directors (or his or her
serving as the delegate of the Board of Directors), excepting only expenses and liabilities arising out of his or her own willful misconduct or bad faith.
7.05     Withholding :
The Company shall withhold from amounts due under this Plan, any amount necessary to enable the Company to remit to the appropriate government entity or
entities on behalf of the Participant as may be required by the federal income tax provisions of the Code, by an applicable state’ s income tax provisions, and by an
applicable city , county or municipality’ s earnings or income tax provisions. Further , the Company shall withhold from the payroll of, or collect from, a Participant the
amount necessary to remit on behalf of the Participant any Social Security and/or Medicare taxes which may be required with respect to amounts deferred or accrued by
a
32
Participant hereunder , as determined by the Company . In addition, to the extent required by Section 409A, amounts deferred under this Plan shall be reported to the
Internal Revenue Service as provided by Section 409A, and any amounts that become taxable hereunder pursuant to Section 409A shall be reported as taxable
compensation to the Participant as provided by Section 409A.
7.06     Section 16 Compliance :
(a)    In General . This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the Act. Accordingly , in the case of a deferral or other action
under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), if it were approved by the Company’ s Board of Directors or Compensation
Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that the Plan shall be administered by delegates of the Board of Directors, in the case of a Participant who is subject to
Section 16 of the Act, in a manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the maximum
possible extent.
(b)    Approval of Distributions : This Subsection shall govern the distribution of a deferral that (i) is being distributed to a Participant in cash, (ii) is
wholly or partly invested in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund at the time the deferral would be valued to determine the amount of cash to be distributed to a
Participant, (iii) either was the subject of a Second Look Election or was not covered by an agreement or Plan provisions, applicable at the time of the Participant’ s
original deferral election, that any investments in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would, once made, remain in that fund until distribution of the deferral,
(iv) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act at the time the interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would be liquidated in
connection with the distribution, and (v) if paid at the time the distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in a violation of Section 16 of
the Act because there is an opposite way transaction that would be matched with the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the PepsiCo Common Stock Fund (either
as a “discretionary transaction,” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular transaction, as applicable) (a “Covered Distribution”). In the case of a Covered
Distribution, if the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution has not received Board
Approval by the time the distribution would be made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then the actual distribution to the
Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier of:
(1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the
Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution, or
(2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the Participant is no longer subject to Section 16 of the
Act, or when the time between the liquidation and an opposite way transaction is suf ficient.
33
7.07     Conformance with Section 409A :
Effective from and after January 1, 2009, at all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A,
and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A
Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.
34
ARTICLE VIII – CLAIMS PROCEDURE
8.01     Claims for Benefits:
If a Participant, Beneficiary or other person (hereafter , "Claimant") does not receive timely payment of any benefits which he or she believes are due and
payable under the Plan, he or she may make a claim for benefits to the Plan Administrator . The claim for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan
Administrator . If the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant within 90 days after the Plan Administrator initially received the
benefit claim. However , if special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the
Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 90-day period. Any notice of a denial of
benefits shall advise the Claimant of the basis for the denial, any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim, and the steps
which the Claimant must take to appeal his or her claim for benefits.
8.02     Appeals of Denied Claims :
Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written appeal for a review of his or her claim by the Plan Administrator . The request for
review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he or she received the notice denying his or her claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be
communicated to the Claimant within 60 days after receipt of a request for appeal. The notice shall set forth the basis for the Plan Administrator's decision. If special
circumstances require an extension of time for processing the appeal, the Plan Administrator will furnish notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the termination
of the initial 60-day period and such extension may not exceed one additional, consecutive 60-day period. In no event shall the Plan Administrator ’s decision be
rendered later than 120 days after receipt of a request for appeal.
8.03     Special Claims Procedures for Disability Determinations:
Notwithstanding Sections 8.01 and 8.02 to the contrary , if the claim or appeal of the Claimant relates to Disability benefits, such claim or appeal shall be
processed pursuant to the applicable provisions of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1 relating to Disability benefits, including Sections 2560.503-
1(d), 2560.503-1(f)(3), 2560.503-1(h)(4) and 2560.503-1(i)(3).
35
ARTICLE IX – AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
9.01     Amendment of Plan:
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has the right in its sole discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time
and in any manner , including the manner of making deferral elections, the terms on which distributions are made, and the form and timing of distributions. However ,
except for mere clarifying amendments necessary to avoid an inappropriate windfall, no Plan amendment shall reduce the amount credited to the Account of any
Participant as of the date such amendment is adopted. Any amendment shall be in writing and adopted by the Committee. All Participants and Beneficiaries shall be
bound by such amendment. Any amendments made to the Plan shall be subject to any restrictions on amendment that are applicable to ensure continued compliance
under Section 409A.
9.02     Termination of Plan :
(a)    The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The Company , acting by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors, or through its entire Board of Directors, reserves the right to discontinue and terminate the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason
(including a change, or an impending change, in the tax laws of the United States or any State). Termination of the Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial
termination shall be binding upon all af fected Participants) and their Beneficiaries, but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited at that time to any
Participant's Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), the termination resolution shall provide for how amounts theretofore credited to af fected
Participants' Accounts will be distributed.
(b)    This Section is subject to the same restrictions related to compliance with Section 409A that apply to Section 9.01. In accordance with these
restrictions, the Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to terminate the Plan and make distributions in connection with a change in ownership
or effective control of the Company or a change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company , all within the meaning of Section 409A (a “Change
in Control”), and the maximum flexibility with respect to how and to what extent to carry this out following a Change in Control as is permissible under Section 409A.
The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms under which a distribution may be made in connection with any change in control with respect to deferrals made
under this 409A Program.
36
ARTICLE X – MISCELLANEOUS
10.01     Limitation on Participant's Rights :
Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company . The Company reserves the right to terminate the
service of any Participant without any liability for any claim against the Company under this Plan, except for a claim for payment of deferrals as provided herein.
10.02     Unfunded Obligation of the Company:
The benefits provided by this Plan are unfunded. All amounts payable under this Plan to Participants are paid from the general assets of the Company . Nothing
contained in this Plan requires the Company to set aside or hold in trust any amounts or assets for the purpose of paying benefits to Participants. Neither a Participant,
Beneficiary , nor any other person shall have any property interest, legal or equitable, in any specific Company asset. This Plan creates only a contractual obligation on
the part of the Company , and the Participant has the status of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts of compensation deferred hereunder .
Such a Participant shall not have any preference or priority over , the rights of any other unsecured general creditor of the Company . No other Company af filiate
guarantees or shares such obligation, and no other Company af filiate shall have any liability to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary .
10.03     Other Plans:
This Plan shall not af fect the right of any Eligible Director or Participant to participate in and receive benefits under and in accordance with the provisions of
any other Director compensation plans which are now or hereafter maintained by the Company , unless the terms of such other plan or plans specifically provide
otherwise or it would cause such other plan to violate a requirement for tax favored treatment.
10.04     Receipt or Release:
Any payment to a Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against the Plan
Administrator , the Recordkeeper and the Company , and the Plan Administrator may require such Participant, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a
receipt and release to such ef fect.
10.05     Governing Law:
This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in accordance with applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by federal
law, in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina. If any provisions of this instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully ef fective.
37
10.06     Gender , Tense and Examples:
In this Plan, whenever the context so indicates, the singular or plural number and the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall be deemed to include the other .
Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passage
of the Plan shall be construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids
limitation on its breadth of application).
10.07     Successors and Assigns; Nonalienation of Benefits:
This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided, however , that the amounts credited to
the Account of a Participant are not (except as provided in Section 7.05) subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, char ge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer , assign, pledge,
encumber , char ge or otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits payable hereunder , including, without limitation, any assignment or alienation in connection with a
separation, divorce, child support or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the Company . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan

I. Cancellation Elections:
Pursuant to Q&A-20(a) of IRS Notice 2005-1, each Eligible Director shall have the right to cancel his or her election to defer Director Compensation for the
2004-2005 Compensation Y ear. Such election to cancel must be filed with the Plan Administrator prior to the end of the 2004-2005 Compensation Y ear and must
follow any other procedures and timing requirements established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (such procedures and timing requirements to be consistent

(b)    Form of Payment . The default form of payment for initial deferral elections is a single lump sum that shall be paid at the time applicable under
Article IV . A Participant may only change the default payment from a lump sum to installments by means of a Second Look Election that meets all of the
requirements of Section 4.04. Form of payment elections for Mandatory Deferrals are governed by Section 4.05.
III. Modifications to Article VI:
The rules set forth in this Article A, Section III apply to any distributions that have occurred or would occur based on events, including any Separations from
Service, or Specific Payment Dates that occurred prior to January 1, 2009.
For purposes of this Article A, Section III, the term “Retirement” shall mean Separation from Service after attaining eligibility for retirement. A Participant
attains eligibility for retirement when he or she attains age 50 while serving as a director on the Board of Directors of the Company .
For purposes of this Article A, Section III, a new Section 6.05 is added as specified below , and existing Sections 6.05 and 6.06 (as set forth in the main portion
of the Plan document) are renumbered as Sections 6.06 and 6.07 respectively .
A For this purpose, Sections 6.01(a)-(f)  read as follows:
A-1
(a) Section 6.02 (Distributions Based on a Specific Payment Date) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a Specific Payment Date and the
Specific Payment Date is reached before the Participant’ s (i) Separation from Service (other than for Retirement), (ii) Disability , or (iii) death. However ,
if such a Participant Separates from Service (other than for Retirement or death) prior to the Specific Payment Date (or prior to processing of the first
installment payment due in connection with the Specific Payment Date), Section 6.03 shall apply . If such a Participant dies prior to the Specific Payment
Date, Section 6.04 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If such a Participant becomes
Disabled prior to the Specific Payment Date, Section 6.06 shall apply to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s
Account.
(b) Section 6.03 (Distributions on Account of a Separation from Service) applies (i) when a Participant has elected to defer until a Separation from Service
and then the Participant Separates from Service (other than for Retirement or death), or (ii) when applicable under Subsection (a) above).
(c) Section 6.04 (Distributions on Account of Death) applies when the Participant dies. If a Participant is entitled to receive or is receiving a distribution
under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 (see below) at the time of his or her death, Section 6.04 shall take precedence over those sections to the extent Section
6.04 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(d) Section 6.05 (Distributions on Account of Retirement) applies when a Participant has elected to defer until a Separation from Service and then the
Participant Separates from Service on account of his or her Retirement. Subsections (c) and (e) of this Section provide for when Section 6.04 or Section
6.06 take precedence over Section 6.05.
(e) Section 6.06 (Distributions on Account of Disability) applies when the Participant becomes Disabled. If a Participant who becomes Disabled dies,
Section 6.04 shall take precedence over Section 6.06 to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account. If a
Participant is entitled to receive or is receiving a distribution under Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.05 at the time of his Disability , Section 6.06 shall take
precedence over those sections to the extent Section 6.06 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of a Participant’ s Account.
(f) Section 6.07 (Distributions on Account of Unforeseeable Emer gency) applies when the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emer gency prior to when a
Participant’ s Account is distributed under Sections 6.02 through 6.06. In this case, the provisions of Section 6.07 shall take precedence over Sections
6.02 through 6.06 to the extent Section 6.07 would result in an earlier distribution of all or part of the Participant’ s Account.
B For this purpose, Section 6.02  reads as follows:
A-2
This Section shall apply to distributions that are to be made upon the occurrence of a Specific Payment Date. In the event a Participant’ s Specific Payment Date
for a Deferral Subaccount is reached before (i) the Participant’ s Disability , or (ii) the Participant’ s Separation from Service (other than Retirement) or (iii) the
Participant’ s death, such Deferral Subaccount shall be distributed based on the occurrence of such Specific Payment Date in accordance with the following
terms and conditions:
(a) If the Participant has not made a valid Second Look Election that includes installment payments, the Deferral Subaccount shall be valued as of the
Distribution V aluation Date that corresponds to the Participant’ s Specific Payment Date, and the resulting amount shall be paid in a single lump sum.
(b) If the Participant has made a valid Second Look Election that includes installment payments, the first installment payment shall be paid (based on the
schedule elected in the Participant’ s Second Look Election) on the Specific Payment Date. Thereafter , installment payments shall continue in accordance
with the schedule elected by the Participant, except as provided in Sections 6.03, 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 (relating to distributions on account of a Separation
from Service, death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency). The amount of each installment shall be determined under Section 6.08. Notwithstanding
the preceding provisions of this Subsection, if before the date the first installment distribution is processed for payment the Participant Separates from
Service other than for Retirement) or the Participant would be entitled to a distribution in accordance with Sections 6.03, 6.04 or 6.06 (relating to a
distribution on account of Separation from Service, death or Disability), the Participant’ s Deferral Subaccounts that would otherwise be distributed based
on such Specific Payment Date shall instead be distributed in accordance with Section 6.04 or 6.05 (relating to distributions on account of death or
Disability), whichever applies, but only to the extent it would result in an earlier distribution of the Participant’ s Subaccounts in the case of Section 6.04
or 6.06.
C For this purpose, Section 6.03  reads as follows:
A Participant’ s total Account shall be distributed upon the occurrence of a Participant's Separation from Service (other than for Retirement, Disability or death)
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section. When used in this Section, the phrase “Separation from Service” shall only refer to a Separation
from Service that is not for Retirement, Disability or death.
(a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), a Participant’ s total Account balance, shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the first
Plan Y ear after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(b) If the Participant incurs a Separation from Service after making a valid Second Look Election (and before the first payment has been processed in
accordance with such Second Look Election), each Deferral Subaccount to which the Second Look Election applies shall be distributed in a single lump
sum payment on the
A-3
latest of the following: (1) the first day of the calendar quarter beginning on or after the fifth anniversary of the payment date selected in the Participant’ s
original deferral election under Section 4.03, (2) the first day of the Plan Y ear following the Separation from Service, or (3) the date applicable under
Subsection (c). However , if the Plan Administrator determines that Section 409A would permit a lump sum payment to be made earlier than the date
specified in clause (1) of the preceding sentence, then the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting the earliest date permissible under Section
409A for the date in clause (1). If the Participant’ s Separation from Service occurs on or after the date the first payment is processed, payment will be
made in accordance with the Second Look Election (but subject to acceleration under Sections 6.04, 6.06 and 6.07 relating to distributions on account of
death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
(c) If the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Key
Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall not be paid, as a result of the Participant’ s Separation from
Service, earlier than the date that is at least 6 months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
D For this purpose, a new Section 6.05  reads as follows:
6.05    Distributions on Account of Retirement :
If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service on account of his or her Retirement, the Participant’ s Account shall be distributed in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Section.
(a) If the Participant’ s Retirement is prior to the Specific Payment Date that is applicable to a Deferral Subaccount, the Participant’ s deferral election
pursuant to Sections 4.03 or 4.04 ( i.e., time and form of payment) shall continue to be given ef fect, and the Deferral Subaccounts shall be distributed
based upon the provisions of Section 6.02.
(b) If the Participant has selected payment of his or her deferral on account of Separation from Service, distribution of the related Deferral Subaccount shall
commence on the first day of the first Plan Y ear after the date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service. Such distribution shall be made in a single
lump sum payment under Section 4.03. However , if the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Retirement (or at such
other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then such Participant’ s Account shall not be paid, as a result of the
Participant’ s Retirement, earlier than the date that is at least 6 months after the Participant’ s Retirement.
(c) If the Participant is receiving installment payments for one or more Deferral Subaccounts in accordance with Section 6.02 at the time of his or her
Retirement, such installment payments shall continue to be paid based upon the Participant’ s Second Look Election (but subject to acceleration under
Sections 6.04, 6.06 and
A-4
6.07 relating to distributions on account of death, Disability and Unforeseeable Emer gency).
IV.    Modification to Article VII .
For periods ef fective from and after January 1, 2005 and on or before December 31, 2008, the language of Section 7.07 shall be replaced in its entirety with the
following language:
7.07    Conformance with Section 409A :
At all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of
deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. Any action that
may be taken (and, to the extent possible, any action actually taken) by the Plan Administrator , the Recordkeeper or the Company shall not be taken (or shall be
void and without ef fect), if such action violates the requirements of Section 409A or if such action would adversely af fect the grandfather of the Pre-409A
Program. If the failure to take an action under the Plan would violate Section 409A, then to the extent it is possible thereby to avoid a violation of Section 409A,
the rights and ef fects under the Plan shall be altered to avoid such violation. A corresponding rule shall apply with respect to a failure to take an action that
would adversely af fect the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. Any provision in this Plan document that is determined to violate the requirements of Section
409A or to adversely af fect the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program shall be void and without ef fect. In addition, any provision that is required to appear in this
Plan document to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, but that is not expressly set forth, shall be deemed to be set forth herein, and the Plan shall be
administered in all respects as if such provision were expressly set forth. A corresponding rule shall apply with respect to a provision that is required to preserve
the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not
contained in this Section.

W I T N E S S E T H:
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and shareholders of PepsiCo have approved the PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), for the purposes and subject to the
provisions set forth in the Plan; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to it in the Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PepsiCo (the “Committee”), at a meeting held on or prior

WHEREAS, awards granted under the Plan are to be evidenced by an Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
 
A. Terms and Conditions Applicable to PSUs. These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the PSUs with a March 1, 2017 Grant Date granted to the Participant as
indicated on the Award Summary.
1. Grant. In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company and agreeing to be bound by the covenants of Paragraph C, PepsiCo hereby grants to the
Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, a target number of PSUs as indicated on the Award Summary. All PSUs granted hereunder are intended to be Performance
Awards (as defined in the Plan) that satisfy the conditions for the Performance-Based Exception (as defined in the Plan) under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”).
2. Vesting and Payment. PSUs may only vest while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Subject to Paragraphs A.3 and A.4 below, the PSUs earned in
accordance with Paragraph A.3 shall vest on March 1, 2020 (the “Vesting Date”) and be paid as soon as practicable after such date (the “Payment Date”). PSUs that become earned
and payable shall be settled in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock, with the Participant receiving one share of PepsiCo Common Stock for each PSU earned. No fractional shares shall

withhold upon the settlement of PSUs in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of the issuance of shares. Unless
the Participant makes other arrangements to satisfy this withholding obligation in accordance with procedures approved by the Company in its discretion, the Company will withhold
shares to satisfy the required withholding obligation related to the settlement of PSUs.
1
3. Earning and Forfeiture of PSUs.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Participant can earn a specified number of PSUs with respect to the 2017-2019 three year performance period (the
“Performance Period,” which shall constitute a “Performance Period” as defined in the Plan), determined based on the achievement of performance targets established by the
Committee. Any portion of the PSU Award that is not earned in accordance with this Paragraph A.3 shall be forfeited and cancelled. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the PSU Award shall be earned as follows:
(a) One-half of the PSU Award shall be earned based on and subject to the level of achievement with respect to a Performance Measure selected by the Committee for the
Performance Period pursuant to the performance scale established by the Committee and communicated to the Participant. The Committee shall determine and certify the results of the
level of achievement of such Performance Measure.
(b) One-half of the PSU Award shall be earned based on and subject to the level of achievement with respect to a second Performance Measure selected by the Committee
for the Performance Period pursuant to the performance scale established by the Committee and communicated to the Participant. The Committee shall determine and certify the
results of the level of achievement of such Performance Measure.
(c) Notwithstanding the achievement of any performance targets established under Paragraphs A.3(a) and (b) above, for any PSUs to vest or become payable the Committee
must determine that the minimum level of performance established by the Committee with respect to a third Performance Measure selected by the Committee for the Performance
Period, and communicated to the Participant, has been met. If the Committee determines that the minimum level of performance has not been met, then no PSUs held by the
Participant shall vest or become payable, and the PSU Award shall be forfeited and cancelled.
Notwithstanding the level of performance achieved with respect to such Performance Measure, or the level of performance achieved with respect to the performance targets
established under Paragraphs A.3(a) and (b) above, the Committee has the discretion to reduce the number of PSUs to be paid. The Committee’s right to exercise this discretion with
respect to the earned portion of the PSU Award shall continue until the date on which the PSUs are delivered to the Participant.
Any PSUs that are not earned in accordance with this Paragraph A.3 shall be forfeited and cancelled. Except in the case of death or Total Disability, the portion of the PSU
Award with respect to which a Participant has satisfied the performance criteria will be payable in one payment on the Payment Date.
4. Effect of Termination of Employment, Retirement, Death and Total Disability.
(a) Termination of Employment. PSUs may vest and become payable only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the
termination of the Participant’s active employment with the Company. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all unvested PSUs shall automatically be forfeited and cancelled
upon the date that the Participant’s active employment with the Company terminates regardless of whether any such PSUs have previously been earned in accordance with Paragraph
A.3 above. An authorized severance leave of absence will not be treated as active employment, and, as a result, the vesting of PSUs will not be extended by any such period.
(b) Retirement Prior to Age 62. If the Participant’s employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date by reason of the Participant’s Retirement prior to attaining at least age
62, then a whole number of
2
the PSUs granted hereunder shall vest on the Participant’s last day of active employment with the Company, with such number determined in proportion to the Participant’s active
service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date (the “Vesting Period”). All PSUs that vest in accordance with
the foregoing sentence shall remain subject to the earning and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs A.2 and A.3 (with subparagraphs 3(a) and 3(b) of Paragraph A each being applied to
one half of the PSU Award that vests in accordance with the foregoing sentence and with subparagraph 3(c) being applied to such vested portion of the PSU Award) and shall be paid
on the original Payment Date.
(c)  Retirement on or After Age 62. If the Participant’s employment terminates by reason of the Participant’s Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then the PSUs
granted hereunder shall become fully vested on the Participant’s last day of active employment with the Company. All such vested PSUs shall remain subject to the earning and
forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs A.2 and A.3 (with subparagraphs 3(a) and 3(b) of Paragraph A each being applied to one half of the PSU Award that vests in accordance with the
foregoing sentence and with subparagraph 3(c) being applied to such vested portion of the PSU Award) and shall be paid on the original Payment Date.
(d) Death or Total Disability. If the Participant’s employment terminates by reason of death or Total Disability, then the target number of PSUs set forth in the Award
Summary shall become fully vested on the Participant’s last day of active employment with the Company (which, for purposes of Total Disability, means the effective date of Total
Disability), and shall be paid as soon as practicable following the date of termination.
(e) Transfers to a Related Entity. In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity and such transfer is arranged and approved by PepsiCo, the PSUs shall continue to
vest (and their time of payment shall be determined) after such transfer by treating the Participant’s employment with the Related Entity as employment with the Company for
purposes of this Agreement. All such PSUs shall remain subject to the earning and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs A.2 and A.3 and shall be paid on the original Payment Date.
5. No Rights as Shareholder. The Participant shall have no rights as a holder of PepsiCo Common Stock with respect to the PSUs granted hereunder unless and until such
PSUs have been settled in shares of Common Stock that have been registered in the Participant’s name as owner.
6. Dividend Equivalents. During the Vesting Period, the Participant shall accumulate dividend equivalents with respect to the PSUs, which dividend equivalents shall be paid
in cash (without interest) to the Participant only if and when the applicable PSUs vest and become payable. Dividend equivalents shall equal the dividends actually paid with respect to
PepsiCo Common Stock during the Vesting Period while (and to the extent) the PSUs remain outstanding and unpaid. For purposes of determining the dividend equivalents
accumulated under this Paragraph C.5, any Performance Stock Units that become payable hereunder shall be considered to have been outstanding from the Grant Date. Upon the
forfeiture of PSUs, any accumulated dividend equivalents attributable to such PSUs shall also be forfeited.
B. Terms and Conditions Applicable to LTC Award. These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the LTC Award with a March 1, 2017 Grant Date granted to the
Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
1. Grant. In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company and agreeing to be bound by the covenants of Paragraph C, PepsiCo hereby grants to the
Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, an LTC Award in the target amount indicated on the Award Summary. The LTC Award granted hereunder is intended to be a
Performance Award (as defined in the Plan) that satisfies the conditions for the Performance-Based Exception (as defined in the Plan) under Code Section 162(m).
3
2. Vesting and Payment. The LTC Award may only vest while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Subject to Paragraphs B.3 and B.4 below, the LTC Award
earned in accordance with Paragraph B.3 shall vest on the Vesting Date and be paid in cash as soon as practicable after such date (the “Payment Date”). Any amount that the
Company may be required to withhold upon the settlement of the LTC Award in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the
time of payment. Unless the Participant makes other arrangements to satisfy this withholding obligation in accordance with procedures approved by the Company in its discretion, the
Company will withhold a portion of the cash settlement amount of the LTC Award sufficient to satisfy any related required withholding obligation.
3. Earning and Forfeiture of LTC Award.
(a) The Participant can earn a specified percentage of the target amount of the LTC Award granted hereunder, equal to the product of (i) the target amount of the LTC
Award set forth in the Award Summary, and (ii) the Relative TSR Performance Factor.
(b) The Relative TSR Performance Factor shall be determined based on the percentile ranking of PepsiCo’s total shareholder return for the Performance Period relative to an
index of peer companies selected by the Committee, calculated in accordance with the method established by the Committee and in accordance with a performance scale established
by the Committee (“Relative TSR”). The Relative TSR Performance Factor shall be rounded to the second decimal. The Relative TSR Performance Factor for Relative TSR
performance between the levels identified in the preceding sentence shall be determined by straight-line interpolation.
(c) Notwithstanding the achievement of the performance target established under Paragraph B.3 (b) above, no LTC Award shall vest or become payable if Relative TSR is
less than 25th percentile relative to the index of peer companies selected by the Committee pursuant to Paragraph B.3(b).
(d) Notwithstanding the achievement of the performance target established under Paragraph B.3 (b) above, no LTC Award shall become payable in excess of the target
amount of the LTC Award unless PepsiCo’s absolute total shareholder return for the Performance Period is greater than zero.
(e)  In addition, for any LTC Award to vest or become payable the Committee must determine that the minimum level of performance established by the Committee with
respect to a Performance Measure (as defined in the Plan) selected by the Committee for the Performance Period, and communicated to the Participant, has been met. If the Committee
determines that the minimum level of performance has not been met, then no LTC Award held by any such Participant shall vest or become payable, and such LTC Award shall be
forfeited and cancelled.
Notwithstanding the level of performance achieved with respect to such Performance Measure, the Committee has the discretion to reduce the amount of the LTC Award
earned to reflect the level of performance achieved with respect to the performance targets established under Paragraphs B.3(b). The Committee’s right to exercise this discretion with
respect to the amount of the LTC Award earned shall continue until the date on which the LTC Award is paid to the Participant.
Any LTC Award not earned in accordance with this Paragraph B.3 shall be forfeited and cancelled. Except in the case of death or Total Disability, the LTC Award for which
a Participant has satisfied the performance criteria will be payable in one payment on the Payment Date.
4
4. Effect of Termination of Employment, Retirement, Death and Total Disability.
(a) Termination of Employment. The LTC Award may vest and become payable only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon
the termination of the Participant’s active employment with the Company. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), any unvested portion of the LTC Award shall automatically be
forfeited and cancelled upon the date that the Participant’s active employment with the Company terminates regardless of whether any portion of such LTC Award has previously been
earned in accordance with Paragraph B.3 above. An authorized severance leave of absence will not be treated as active employment, and, as a result, the vesting of any LTC Award
will not be extended by any such period.
(b) Retirement Prior to Age 62. If the Participant’s employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date by reason of the Participant’s Retirement prior to attaining at least age
62, then a portion of the target LTC Award granted hereunder shall vest on the Participant’s last day of active employment with the Company, with such number determined in
proportion to the Participant’s active service (measured in calendar days) during the Vesting Period. Any portion of an LTC Award that vests in accordance with the foregoing sentence
shall remain subject to the earning and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3 and shall be paid on the original Payment Date.
(c) Retirement on or After Age 62. If the Participant’s employment terminates by reason of the Participant’s Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then the LTC Award
granted hereunder shall become fully vested on the Participant’s last day of active employment with the Company. Any such vested LTC Award shall remain subject to the earning and
forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3 and shall be paid on the original Payment Date.
(d) Death or Total Disability. If the Participant’s employment terminates by reason of death or Total Disability, then the target amount of the LTC Award set forth in the
Award Summary shall become fully vested on the Participant’s last day of active employment with the Company (which, for purposes of Total Disability, means the effective date of
Total Disability), and shall be paid as soon as practicable following the date of termination.
(e) Transfers to a Related Entity. In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity and such transfer is arranged and approved by PepsiCo, the LTC Award shall
continue to vest (and the time of payment shall be determined) after such transfer by treating the Participant’s employment with the Related Entity as employment with the Company
for purposes of this Agreement. Any such LTC Award shall remain subject to the earning and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3 and shall be paid on the original Payment
Date.
C. Prohibited Conduct. In consideration of the Company disclosing and providing access to Confidential Information, as more fully described in Paragraph C.2 below, after the
date hereof, the grant by the Company of the PSUs and the LTC Award, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
Participant and the Company, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows.
 
1. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation. The Participant hereby covenants and agrees that at all times during his or her employment with the Company and for a period of
twelve months after the termination of the Participant’s employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever (including a termination due to the Participant’s Retirement), he or
she will not, without the prior written consent of PepsiCo’s chief human resources officer or chief legal officer, either directly or indirectly, for himself/herself or on behalf of or in
conjunction with any other person, partnership, corporation or other entity, engage in any activities prohibited in the following Paragraphs C.1(a) through (c):
 
5
(a) The Participant shall not, in any country in which the Company operates, accept any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, provide services in any capacity,
or acquire any ownership interest that involves the Participant’s Participation in an entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces Covered Products, unless such entity makes retail
sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the Company;
 
(b) With respect to Covered Products, the Participant shall not directly or indirectly solicit for competitive business purposes any customer or Prospective Customer of the
Company called on, serviced by, or contacted by the Participant in any capacity during his or her employment; or
 
(c) The Participant shall not in any way, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Participant’s recommendation, suggestion, identification or
advice), solicit any Company employee to leave the Company’s employment or to accept any position with any other entity.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Paragraph C.1, the Participant shall not be considered to be in violation of Paragraph C.1(a) solely by reason of owning, directly or indirectly, up to
five percent (5%) in the aggregate of any class of securities of any publicly traded corporation engaged in the prohibited activities described in Paragraph C.1(a).
2. Non-Disclosure. In order to assist the Participant with his or her duties, the Company shall continue to provide the Participant with access to confidential and proprietary
operational information and other confidential information that is either information not known by actual or potential competitors, customers and third parties of the Company or is
proprietary information of the Company (“Confidential Information”). Such Confidential Information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a result of
his or her positions with the Company. Examples of such Confidential Information include, without limitation, non-public information about the Company’s customers, suppliers,
distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations, structure and methods of operation; its product lines, formulae and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions;
its research and know-how; its production techniques; its financial data; its advertising and promotional ideas and strategy; information maintained in its computer systems; devices,
processes, compilations of information and records; and its plans and strategies.  The Participant agrees that such Confidential Information remains confidential even if committed to
the Participant’s memory.  The Participant agrees, during the term of his or her employment and at all times thereafter, not to use, divulge, or furnish or make accessible to any third
party, company, corporation or other organization (including but not limited to, customers or competitors of the Company), without the Company’s prior written consent, any
Confidential Information of the Company, except as necessary in his or her position with the Company.  Nothing in this Agreement, the Plan, any other Award made under the Plan or
in any other confidentiality provision to which the Participant may be subject as a result of the Participant’s employment with the Company shall prohibit the Participant from, without
notice to the Company, communicating with government agencies, providing information to government agencies, participating in government agency investigations, filing a
complaint with government agencies, or testifying in government agency proceedings concerning any possible legal violations or from receiving any monetary award for information
provided to a government agency.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.
Further, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act: “An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade
secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or
investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.  An individual who
files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
6
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not
disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.”
 
3. Return of Confidential Information and Company Property. The Participant agrees that whenever the Participant’s employment with the Company ends for any reason, (a)
all documents containing or referring to the Company’s Confidential Information as may be in the Participant’s possession, or over which the Participant may have control, and all
other property of the Company provided to the Participant by the Company during the course of the Participant’s employment with the Company will be returned by the Participant to
the Company immediately, with no request being required; and (b) all Company computer and computer-related equipment and software, and all Company property, files, records,
documents, drawings, specifications, lists, equipment, and similar items relating to the business of the Company, whether prepared by the Participant or otherwise, coming into the
Participant’s possession or control during the course of his employment shall remain the exclusive property of the Company, and shall be delivered by the Participant to the Company
immediately, with no request being required.
 
4. Misconduct. During the term of his or her employment with the Company, the Participant shall not engage in any of the following acts that are considered to be contrary to
the Company’s best interests: (a) breaching any contract with or violating any obligation to the Company, including the Company’s Code of Conduct, Insider Trading Policy or any
other written policies of the Company, (b) unlawfully trading in the securities of PepsiCo or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment
with the Company, (c) committing a felony or other serious crime, (d) engaging in any activity that constitutes gross misconduct in the performance of his or her employment duties or
(e) engaging in any action that constitutes gross negligence or misconduct and that causes or contributes to the need for an accounting adjustment to PepsiCo’s financial results.
 
5. Reasonableness of Provisions. The Participant agrees that: (a) the terms and provisions of this Agreement are reasonable and constitute an otherwise enforceable agreement
to which the terms and provisions of this Paragraph C are ancillary or a part of; (b) the consideration provided by the Company under this Agreement is not illusory; (c) the restrictions
contained in this Paragraph C are necessary and reasonable for the protection of the legitimate business interests and goodwill of the Company; and (d) the consideration given by the
Company under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provision by the Company of Confidential Information to the Participant, gives rise to the Company’s interest in the
covenants set forth in this Paragraph C.
 
6. Repayment and Forfeiture. The Participant specifically recognizes and affirms that each of the covenants contained in Paragraphs C.1 through C.4 of this Agreement is a
material and important term of this Agreement that has induced the Company to provide for the award of the PSUs and the LTC Award granted hereunder, the disclosure of
Confidential Information referenced herein, and the other promises made by the Company herein.  The Participant further agrees that in the event that (i) the Company determines that
the Participant has breached any term of Paragraphs C.1 through C.4 or (ii) all or any part of Paragraph C is held or found invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever by a
court of competent jurisdiction in an action between the Participant and the Company, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity the Company may have available to it, the
Company may in its sole discretion:
 
(a)  cancel any unpaid PSUs or any LTC Award granted hereunder; and
 
7
(b)  require the Participant to pay to the Company the value (determined as of the date paid) of any PSUs and any portion of any LTC Award granted hereunder that
have been paid out.
In addition to the provisions of this Paragraph C.6, the Participant agrees that he or she will be bound by the terms of any Company compensation clawback policy
applicable to the Participant that the Company may adopt from time to time.
 
7. Equitable Relief. In the event the Company determines that the Participant has breached or attempted or threatened to breach any term of Paragraph C, in addition to any
other remedies at law or in equity the Company may have available to it, it is agreed that the Company shall be entitled, upon application to any court of proper jurisdiction, to a
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction (without the necessity of (a) proving irreparable harm, (b) establishing that monetary damages are inadequate or (c) posting any
bond with respect thereto) against the Participant prohibiting such breach or attempted or threatened breach by proving only the existence of such breach or attempted or threatened
breach.
8. Extension of Restrictive Period. The Participant agrees that the period during which the covenants contained in this Paragraph C shall be effective shall be computed by
excluding from such computation any time during which the Participant is in violation of any provision of Paragraph C.
9. Acknowledgments. The Company and the Participant agree that it was their intent to enter into a valid and enforceable agreement.  The Participant and the Company
thereby acknowledge the reasonableness of the restrictions set forth in Paragraph C, including the reasonableness of the geographic area, duration as to time and scope of activity
restrained.  The Participant further acknowledges that his or her skills are such that he or she can be gainfully employed in noncompetitive employment and that the agreement not to
compete will not prevent him or her from earning a living.  The Participant agrees that if any covenant contained in Paragraph C of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to contain limitations as to time, geographical area, or scope of activity that are not reasonable and impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or
other business interest of the Company, then the court shall reform the covenant to the extent necessary to cause the limitations contained in the covenant as to time, geographical area,
and scope of activity to be restrained to be reasonable and to impose a restraint that is not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of the Company
and to enforce the covenants as reformed.
10. Provisions Independent. The covenants on the part of the Participant in this Paragraph C shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other agreement, including
any employee benefit agreement, and independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of the Participant against the Company,
whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of such covenants.
11. Notification of Subsequent Employer. The Participant agrees that the Company may notify any person or entity employing the Participant or evidencing an intention of
employing the Participant of the existence and provisions of this Agreement.
12. Transfers to a Related Entity. In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity as a result of actions by PepsiCo, any reference to “Company” in this Paragraph C
shall be deemed to refer to such Related Entity in addition to the Company.
8
D. Additional Terms and Conditions.
1. Adjustment for Change in Common Stock. In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of PepsiCo Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, spin-off or other similar corporate change the number and type of shares to which the PSUs
held by the Participant relate shall be adjusted to such extent (if any), determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee.
 
2. Nontransferability. Unless the Committee specifically determines otherwise: (a) the PSUs and LTC Award are personal to the Participant and (b) neither the PSUs nor the LTC
Award shall be transferable or assignable, other than in the case of the Participant’s death by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported transfer or assignment
shall be null and void.
 
3. Definitions. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
(a)  “Covered Products” means any product that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the Company is producing, marketing, selling or licensing such
product anywhere in the world: beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks, tea, water, juice drinks, sports drinks, coffee drinks, energy drinks and value added
dairy drinks; juices and juice products; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks, meat snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies; hot cereals; pancake mixes;
value-added rice products; pancake syrup; value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals; dry pasta products; or any product or service that the Participant had reason to know was
under development by the Company during the Participant’s employment with the Company.
 
(b) “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include, without limitation: (i) serving as a director, officer, employee consultant or contractor with respect to such a business
entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business entity or one or
more products it produces.
(c) “Prospective Customer” shall mean any individual or entity of which the Participant has gained knowledge as a result of the Participant’s employment with the Company
and with which the Participant dealt with or had contact with during the six (6) months preceding his or her termination of employment with the Company.
(d) “Related Entity” shall mean any entity (i) as to which PepsiCo directly or indirectly owns 20% or more, but less than a majority, of the entity’s voting securities, general
partnership interests, or other voting or management rights at the relevant time and (ii) which the Committee or its delegate deems in its sole discretion to be a related entity at the
relevant time.
  
(e) “Retirement” shall mean (i) early, normal or late retirement as used in the U.S. pension plan of the Company in which the Participant participates (if any) and for which
the Participant is eligible pursuant to the terms of such plan or (ii) termination of employment after attaining at least age 55 and completing at least 10 years of service with the
Company (or, if earlier, after attaining at least age 65 and completing at least five years of service with the Company), with the number of years of service completed by a Participant
subject to clause (ii) to be calculated in accordance with administrative procedures established from time to time under the Plan.
 
(f) “Total Disability” shall mean being considered totally disabled under the PepsiCo Long-Term Disability Program (as amended and restated from time to time), with such
status having resulted in
9
benefit payments from such plan or another Company-sponsored disability plan and 12 months having elapsed since the Participant was so considered to be disabled from the cause of
the current disability. The effective date of a Participant’s Total Disability shall be the first day that all of the foregoing requirements are met.
 
4. Notices. Any notice to be given to PepsiCo in connection with the terms of this Agreement shall be addressed to PepsiCo at 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York
10577, Attention: Senior Vice President, Total Rewards, or such other address as PepsiCo may hereafter designate to the Participant. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been
duly given when personally delivered, addressed as aforesaid, or when enclosed in a properly sealed envelope or wrapper, addressed as aforesaid, and deposited, postage prepaid, with
the federal postal service.
 
5. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any assignee or successor in interest to PepsiCo, whether by merger, consolidation or the sale
of all or substantially all of PepsiCo’s assets. PepsiCo will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all
of the business and/or assets of PepsiCo expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that PepsiCo would be required to
perform it if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Participant or his or her legal representative and any person to
whom the PSUs and LTC Award may be transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
 
6. No Contract of Employment; Agreement’s Survival. This Agreement is not a contract of employment.  This Agreement does not impose on the Company any obligation to
retain the Participant in its employ and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company to terminate the Participant’s employment relationship at any time. This Agreement shall
survive the termination of the Participant’s employment for any reason. If an entity ceases to be a majority-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo for purposes of Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
Act or a Related Entity, such cessation shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to be a termination of employment with the Company with respect to any Participant
employed by such entity, unless the Committee or its delegate determines otherwise in its sole discretion.
 
7. Registration, Listing and Qualification of Shares. The Committee may require that the Participant make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as
the Committee deems appropriate to assure compliance with or exemption from the requirements of any securities exchange, any foreign, federal, state or local law, any governmental
regulatory body, or any other applicable legal requirement, and PepsiCo Common Stock shall not be issued unless and until the Participant makes such representations and agreements
and furnished such information as the Committee deems appropriate.
8. Amendment; Waiver. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be amended in writing by the chief human resources officer or chief legal officer of PepsiCo (or either
of their delegates); provided, however, that (i) no such amendment shall adversely affect the awards granted hereunder without the Participant’s written consent (except to the extent
the Committee reasonably determines that such amendment is necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law, including the provisions of Code Section 409A and the
regulations thereunder pertaining to the deferral of compensation, or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which PepsiCo Common Stock is listed or quoted); and (ii) the
amendment must be permitted under the Plan. The Company’s failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement or failure to exercise, or any delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or any such right, power or remedy which the Board (as defined in
the Plan), the Committee or the Company has under this Agreement.
10
 
9. Severability or Reform by Court. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is deemed by a court to be broader than permitted by applicable law, then such provision
shall be reformed (or otherwise revised or narrowed) so that it is enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared by a
court to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected.
 
10. Plan Terms. The PSUs, the LTC Award and the terms and conditions set forth herein are subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Plan and any guidelines,
policies or regulations which govern administration of the Plan. The Committee reserves its rights to amend or terminate the Plan at any time without the consent of the Participant;
provided, however, that PSUs and LTC Awards outstanding under the Plan at the time of such action shall not, without the Participant’s written consent, be adversely affected thereby
(except to the extent the Committee reasonably determines that such amendment or termination is necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law, including the provisions of
Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder pertaining to the deferral of compensation, or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which PepsiCo Common Stock is
listed or quoted). All interpretations or determinations of the Committee or its delegate shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Participant (and his or her legal representatives
and any recipient of a transfer of the PSUs or LTC Award permitted by this Agreement) on any question arising hereunder or under the Plan or other guidelines, policies or regulations
which govern administration of the Plan.
 
11. Participant Acknowledgements. By entering into this Agreement, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that:
 
(a) the PSUs and the LTC Award will be exclusively governed by the terms of the Plan, including the right reserved by the Company to amend or cancel the Plan at any time
without the Company incurring liability to the Participant (except for PSUs and LTC Awards already granted under the Plan);
 
(b) the Participant has been provided a copy of PepsiCo’s Prospectus relating to the Plan, the PSUs (and the shares covered thereby) and the LTC Award;
 
(c) PSUs and LTC Awards are not a constituent part of the Participant’s salary and that the Participant is not entitled, under the terms and conditions of his/her employment, or
by accepting or being awarded any PSUs or LTC Awards pursuant to this Agreement, to require options, performance stock units, cash or other awards to be granted to him/her in the
future under the Plan or any other plan;
 
(d) upon payment of PSUs or LTC Awards, the Participant will arrange for payment to the Company an estimated amount to cover employee payroll taxes resulting from such
payment and/or, to the extent necessary, any balance may be withheld from the Participant’s wages;
 
(e) benefits received under the Plan will be excluded from the calculation of termination indemnities or other severance payments;
(f) in the event of termination of the Participant’s employment, a severance or notice period to which the Participant may be entitled under local law and which follows the
date of termination specified in a notice of termination or other document evidencing the termination of the Participant’s employment will not be treated as active employment for
purposes of this Agreement and, as a result, vesting of unvested PSUs or LTC Awards will not be extended by any such period;
 
(g) this Agreement will be interpreted and applied so that the PSUs and the LTC Award, to the extent possible, will not be subject to Code Section 409A. To the extent such
awards are subject to Code
11
Section 409A because of the Participant’s eligibility for Retirement, then payments limited to the earliest permissible payment date under Code Section 409A shall be made following
a Change in Control only (i) upon a Change in Control if it qualifies under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) (a “409A CIC”), and (ii) upon a termination of employment if it occurs
after a 409A CIC and it constitutes a Section 409A separation from service (and in this case, the six-month delay of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) shall apply to “specified
employees,” determined under the default rules of Section 409A or such other rules as apply generally under the Company’s Section 409A plans). Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, this Agreement will be modified to the extent the Committee reasonably determines is necessary or appropriate for such PSUs or LTC Awards to comply with Code
Section 409A; and
(h) the non-disclosure provisions set forth in Paragraph C.2. supersede and replace in their entirety the non-disclosure provisions set forth in the Plan as in effect on the date
hereof, in any agreement evidencing an Award made under the Plan and in any other Awards made under the Plan.
 
 
12. Right of Set-Off. The Participant agrees, in the event that the Company in its reasonable judgment determines that the Participant owes the Company any amount due to
any loan, note, obligation or indebtedness, including but not limited to amounts owed to the Company pursuant to the Company’s tax equalization program or the Company’s policies
with respect to travel and business expenses, and if the Participant has not satisfied such obligation(s), then the Company may instruct the plan administrator to withhold and/or sell
shares of PepsiCo Common Stock acquired by the Participant upon settlement of the PSUs (to the extent such PSUs are not subject to Code Section 409A), or the Company may
deduct funds equal to the amount of such obligation from other funds due to the Participant from the Company (including with respect to any LTC Award) to the maximum extent
permitted by Code Section 409A.
 
13. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Participant hereby consents and agrees to electronic delivery of any Plan documents, proxy materials, annual reports and other
related documents.  The Participant hereby consents to any and all procedures that the Company has established or may establish for an electronic signature system for delivery and
acceptance of Plan documents (including documents relating to any programs adopted under the Plan), and agrees that his or her electronic signature is the same as, and shall have the
same force and effect as, his or her manual signature.  Participant consents and agrees that any such procedures and delivery may be effected by a third party engaged by the Company
to provide administrative services related to the Plan, including any program adopted under the Plan.
 
14. Data Privacy. Participant hereby acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and/or transfer of Personal Data as defined and described in this Paragraph
D.14.  Participant is not obliged to consent, however a failure to provide consent, or the withdrawal of consent at any time, may impact Participant’s ability to participate in the Plan. 
The Company and/or Participant’s employer collects and maintains certain personal information about Participant that may include name, home address and telephone number, date of
birth, social security number or other government or employer-issued identification number, salary grade, hire data, salary, citizenship, job title, any shares of PepsiCo Common Stock,
or details of all performance stock units, long-term cash awards or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, cancelled, purchased, vested, or unvested (collectively “Personal
Data”).  The Company may use, process and/or transfer Personal Data amongst themselves to implement, administer and/or manage Participant’s participation in the Plan. The
Company may further use, process, analyze and/or transfer Personal Data for its overall administration, management and/or improvement of the Plan and/or to comply with any
applicable laws and regulations. The Company maintains technical, administrative and physical safeguards designed to protect Personal Data.  The Company may share and/
12
or transfer Personal Data, in electronic or other format, to third parties including but not limited to the Plan’s service provider. Such third parties assist in the implementation,
administration and/or management of the Plan or Participant’s participation in the Plan, for example to facilitate the holding of shares of stock on Participant’s behalf or to process the
Participant’s election to deposit shares of stock acquired pursuant to the Plan with a broker or other third party. Third parties retained by the Company may use the Personal Data as
authorized by the Company to provide the requested services. Third parties may be located throughout the world, including but not limited to the United States.  Third parties often
maintain their own published policies that describe their privacy and security practices. The Company is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third parties.
Participant may access, review or amend certain Personal Data by contacting the Company and/or the Plan’s service provider.
 
15. Stock Ownership Guidelines/Share Retention Policy. The Participant agrees as a condition of this grant that, in the event that the Participant is or becomes subject to the
Company’s Stock Ownership Guidelines and/or Share Retention Policy, the Participant shall not sell any shares obtained upon settlement of the PSUs unless such sale complies with
the Stock Ownership Guidelines and the Share Retention Policy as in effect from time to time.
 
16. Governing Law. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs D.10 and D.11, this Agreement shall be governed, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York, without giving effect to conflict of law rules or principles.
 
17. Choice of Venue. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs D.10 and D.11, any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of or based on any right arising
out of this Agreement may be brought against the Participant or the Company only in the courts of the State of New York or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the Participant and the Company consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any
such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein.
 
18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains all the understanding and agreements between the Participant and the Company regarding the subject matter hereof.
