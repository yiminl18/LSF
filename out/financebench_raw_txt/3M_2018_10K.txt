Research and Patents
 
Research and product development constitutes an important part of 3M’s activities and has been a major driver of 3M’s sales and profit growth. Research,
development and related expenses totaled $1.821 billion in 2018, $1.870 billion in 2017 and $1.764 billion in 2016. Research and development, covering
basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion
in 2018, $1.352 billion in 2017 and $1.248 billion in 2016. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which
include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process
research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects
and impairments.
 
The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign
patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to
specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 
The Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of
related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments.
 
Raw Materials
 
In 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy
productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and
multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the
Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future
shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful
management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources.
3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.
 
Environmental Law Compliance
 
3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making,
necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past
operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).
 
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed.
Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally
no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
 
In 2018, 3M expended approximately $27 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for
remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital
expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers,
containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of
business. Consistent with the Company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known
projects are presently expected to be approximately $75 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify
manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.

While the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental
compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7,
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company may also make forward-
looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In
addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.
 
Forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance. Words such as
“plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “forecast” and other words and terms
of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include, among others, statements relating to:
·
the Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial performance, and market
position,
·
worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial conditions of our
suppliers and customers, trade restrictions such as tariffs in addition to retaliatory counter measures, and natural and other disasters or climate
change affecting the operations of the Company or our suppliers and customers,
·
new business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products,
·
the scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,
·
the outcome of contingencies, such as legal and regulatory proceedings,
·
future levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,
·
future availability of and access to credit markets,
·
pension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,
·
asset impairments,
·
tax liabilities,
·
information technology security, and
·
the effects of changes in tax (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), environmental and other laws and regulations in the United States and other
countries in which we operate.
 
The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Table of Contents
 
Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual
future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of
factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,” “Financial Condition and Liquidity” and annually in “Critical
Accounting Estimates.” Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be
considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional
information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on
Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.
 
Item 1A.  
Risk Factors
 
 
 
Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors
is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
Results of Operations.”
 
* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions.
 The Company operates in more
than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company’s business is subject to global
competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as
slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions,
inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade
restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in
the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or
climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest
rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
 
* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.
 The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of capital. The major
rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which
include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has
an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. The
Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the
Company’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the
Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.
 
* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.
 Demand for the Company’s products, which impacts revenue
and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company’s response to downward
pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of
customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve
incentive goals; (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in
customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company’s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to
disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available
data.
 
* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and
earnings. 
Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are
derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be
adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
 
10
 
Table of Contents
 
* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to
continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.
 This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in
product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of
new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
 
* The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy,
including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters
and other factors.
 The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their
derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural
and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a
material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no
assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.
 
* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business
strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. 
The Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure
and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to
acquisitions, future results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.
 
* The Company’s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.
 The Company utilizes various
tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and
internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing
3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource
planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.
 
* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system as part of
business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information
technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers,
and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. 
In the ordinary course of business,
the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,
transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data,
including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to
privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training,
monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company’s information technology networks and
infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power
outages, computer viruses, ransomware, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other
catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. While we have
experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of vulnerabilities to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure,
none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its
ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruptions or
shutdowns, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance
coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.
 
* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.
 The
performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in
market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan
11
 
Table of Contents
 
assets, and relevant legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and
adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
 
* The Company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product
liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, or other matters.
The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are
often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance
receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or
judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable
development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular
period. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note
16 “Commitments and Contingencies” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

3M owns the majority of its physical properties. 3M’s physical facilities are highly suitable for the purposes for which they were designed. Because 3M is a
global enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, properties are often used by multiple business segments.

Item 5. 
Market for Registrant’
 
s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
 
Equity compensation plans’ information is incorporated by reference from Part III, Item 12, “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management and Related Stockholder Matters,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Item 5. At January 31, 2019, there were
76,596 shareholders of record. 3M’s stock ticker symbol is MMM and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE), the Chicago Stock
Exchange, Inc., and the SWX Swiss Exchange. Cash dividends declared and paid totaled $1.36 and $1.175 per share for each quarter in 2018 and 2017,
respectively.
 
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
 
Repurchases of 3M common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In
February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end
date. In November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new
program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date.

Year 2018 and fourth quarter EPS:
 
For the fourth quarter of 2018, net income attributable to 3M was $1.347 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared to $523 million, or $0.85 per diluted
share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 167 percent on a per diluted share basis. Adjusting for the impacts related to the resolution of the
Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD) matter and accounting for the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), as further described in the
Operating income, operating income margin, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the
Minnesota NRD resolution and the measurement period adjustment to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP
measures) 
section below, net income attributable to 3M was $1.366 billion, or $2.31 diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $1.285 billion,
or $2.10 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 10.0 percent on a per diluted share basis.
 
For full year 2018, net income attributable to 3M was $5.349 billion, or $8.89 per diluted share basis, compared to $4.858 billion, or $7.93 per diluted share,
for full year 2017, an increase of 12.1 percent on a per diluted share. Adjusting for the NRD matter and the TCJA as described further below, net income
was $6.295 billion, or $10.46 per diluted share for the full year 2018, compared to $5.620 billion, or $9.17 per diluted share for full year 2017, an increase
of 14.1 percent on a per diluted share basis.
 
These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the section that follows.
 
Additional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in earnings per diluted share follows:
 
2017 divestiture of identity management business
:
·
In May 2017, 
3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain
of $457 million, which was reported within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business. The earnings per share impact reflects the specific
income tax rate used for this divestiture.
 
Organic growth/productivity and other:
·
Fourth quarter and full year 2018 year-on-year benefits include higher organic local-currency sales, selling price increases, and business
transformation, which is having a positive impact on 3M’s productivity efforts. Higher raw material costs partially offset these year-on-year
benefits.
·
Lower year-on-year restructuring (other than activity related to the Communication Markets Division divestiture), portfolio and footprint actions
increased pre-tax earnings by approximately $58 million and $307 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively. These charges
included $24 million related to exit activities and $80 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs taken in the first quarter
of 2017, $99 million in restructuring actions and $51 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs taken in the second quarter
of 2017, $35 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs taken in the third quarter of 2017, in addition to $23 million
related to exit activities and $41 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs taken in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
Acquisitions/other divestiture gains:
·
In aggregate, acquisitions, year-on-year divestitures gains (other than the sale of the Communication Markets Division and identity management
business), and lost operating income from divested businesses (other than lost income related to the  divestiture of the Communication Markets
Division) decreased earnings per diluted share by 12 cents year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2018 and decreased earnings per diluted share by
10 cents for full year 2018.
·
Remaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division decreased earnings per
diluted share by 3 cents and 5 cents year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2018, respectively.
16
 
Table of Contents
 
Foreign exchange impacts:
·
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings year-on-year by approximately $27 million and approximately $42 million,
or the equivalent of 3 cents and 5 cents per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign
currency changes on tax rates.
 
Legal-related charges
·
In the second quarter of 2018, 3M reached agreements in principle on a number of respiratory mask/asbestos claims and an oral care product
liability matter, the implications of which resulted in an increase in certain legal accruals. Refer to Note 16 for further details.
 
Other expense:
·
Fourth quarter 2018’s interest expense (net of interest income) decreased $72 million, primarily due to the $96 million early extinguishment of
debt charge in the fourth quarter 2017 that was not repeated in 2018. Full year 2018’s interest expense (net of interest income) increased $8
million year-on-year as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and higher borrowing costs.
·
On a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense, in addition to
lower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year.
 
Income tax rate, excluding Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) measurement period adjustment:
·
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 21.6 percent, a decrease of 47 percentage points versus 2017. The effective tax rate for
full year 2018 was 23.4 percent, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points versus 2017.
·
The effect of income taxes on items that had specific tax rates are reflected within their respective diluted earnings per share impacts in the table
above for both the fourth quarter and full year 2018. Additionally, as discussed in the section below titled 
Operating income, operating income
margin, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Minnesota NRD resolution and
the measurement period adjustment to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures)
, excluding the
Minnesota NRD Resolution and measurement period adjustment related to TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 20.5 percent and 20.1
percent in the fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018, respectively. Excluding the $762 million impact related to the enactment of the TCJA in the
fourth quarter of 2017, the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 was 23.0 percent and 25.4 percent,
respectively.
·
Factors that decreased the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 primarily related to the favorable aspects of the TCJA such
as the decrease in the U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to
transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities (further discussed below), and increased benefits from the R&D tax credit.
These decreases were partially offset by the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income
(GILTI) provision, and lower excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.
 
Shares of common stock outstanding:
·
Lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share by 8 cents and 18 cents per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year 2018,
respectively. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 declined 3.4 percent and 1.8 percent year-on-
year, respectively, which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares relates to the Company’s
purchase of $1.3 billion and $4.9 billion of its own stock in the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively.

Table of Contents
 
 
2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions and exit activities:
·
In June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $494 million as a
result of this divestiture. Additionally in December 2018, 3M completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration
services portion of the business based in Germany and reflected a pre-tax gain of $15 million as a result of this divestiture. Both divestitures were
reported within the Company’s Electronics and Energy business.  During the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, management approved
and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets
Division divestiture. These actions affected approximately 1,200 positions worldwide and resulted in a second quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of
$105 million and a fourth quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates. The aggregate net
impact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 2 cents and 50 cents per diluted share for the
fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, and reflects the specific income tax rate associated with these items.
 
Year 2017 EPS:
 
2017 divestiture of identity management business
:
·
In May 2017, 
3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain
of $457 million. The earnings per share impact reflects the specific income tax rate used for this divestiture.
 
Organic growth/productivity and other:
·
Organic growth/productivity in 2017 included benefits from higher organic local-currency sales, raw material cost decreases from sourcing cost
reduction projects, and business transformation, which had a positive impact on 3M’s productivity efforts. These benefits were partially offset by
higher defined benefit pension service cost expenses. During 2017, organic growth and productivity were the primary drivers for the year-on-year
benefit.
·
Year-on-year incremental strategic investments decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $413 million in 2017. These incremental strategic
investments are comprised of 3M’s investments in growth initiatives and optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint.
 
Acquisitions/other divestiture gains:
·
Acquisitions and divestitures (other than the sale of the identity management business) had a neutral impact to earnings per diluted share for full
year 2017. Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related primarily to the acquisition of Scott
Safety (fourth quarter 2017). The net impact related to Scott Safety included income from operations, more than offset by the transaction and
integration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to financing costs of Scott Safety are also included. The net impact related to Scott
Safety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Full year 2017 had year-on-year operating income impacts from the
following divestitures: Polyfoam and the remaining portion of the library system business (both in first quarter 2016), protective films business
and cathode battery technology out-license business (both in fourth quarter 2016), prescription safety eyewear business (January 2017), tolling
and automated license/number plate recognition business (second quarter of 2017), and electronic monitoring business (fourth quarter 2017). The
incremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestiture impact, net of lost operating loss/(income) during 2017 was an increase of approximately 7
cents per diluted share.
 
Foreign exchange impacts:
·
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $111 million year-on-year in 2017, excluding the impact
of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 13 cents per diluted share for the full year 2017.
 
Legal – respirator mask actuarial reserve
·
In the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Company’s regular review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, the Company increased its
accruals. Refer to Note 16 for more details
.
 
18
 
Table of Contents
 
Other expense:
·
Other expense decreased earnings per share for 2017, largely due to the loss on extinguishment of debt, higher U.S. average balances, and higher
interest rates. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a charge of $96 million, which contributed to a year-on-year decrease of 11 cents per
diluted share. Additionally, the portion of interest expense related to the financing costs of acquiring Scott Safety, which was equivalent to a year-
on-year decrease of 2 cents per diluted share, is included in the acquisitions and divestitures impact described above.
·
On a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense, in addition to
lower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year
 
Income tax rate, excluding Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) measurement period adjustment:
·
The effect of income taxes on items that had specific tax rates are reflected within their respective diluted earnings per share impacts in the table
above for full year 2017. As discussed in the section below, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of
the TCJA, which was equivalent to a decrease of $1.24 per diluted share in 2017. The effective tax rate was 35.5 percent, an increase of 7.2
percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 25.4 percent in the full year 2017, a decrease of
2.9 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the fourth quarter and full year 2017 change in tax rate was driven largely by
increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, favorable geographic mix and other items, as referenced in Note 10.
 
Shares of common stock outstanding:
·
Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2017 declined 1.0 percent year-on-year, which benefited earnings per share. The Company
purchased $2.1 billion of its own stock in 2017.
 
Operating income, operating income margin, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the
Minnesota NRD resolution and the measurement period adjustment to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP
measures):
 
As further discussed in Note 16, in February 2018, 3M reached an agreement with the State of Minnesota that resolved the previously disclosed Natural
Resource Damages (NRD) lawsuit filed by the State against the Company related to certain PFCs present in the environment. Under the terms of the
settlement, 3M agreed to provide an $850 million grant to the State for a special “3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.” This Fund will enable
projects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to residents and enhancing groundwater
recharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space
preservation. 3M recorded a charge of $897 million ($710 million after-tax), inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018
associated with the resolution of this matter. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a related $60 million tax expense resulting from the Company’s
ongoing IRS examination under the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) and new guidance released under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Also during the
first quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a tax expense of $217 million related to a measurement period adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded in
December 2017 from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). In the fourth quarter 2018, 3M finalized the tax impact related to TCJA with a
reversal of previously recorded tax expense in the amount of $41 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The
expense was primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and was net of remeasurement of
3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount was subject to
adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by SEC guidance.
In addition to providing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of the
NRD resolution and enactment/measurement period adjustments to the impact of the enactment of the TCJA. These items represent significant
charges/benefits that impacted the Company’s financial results. Operating income, operating income margin, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings
per share are all measures for which 3M provides the GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are
they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company’s operations. The
Company believes that discussion of
19
 
Table of Contents
 
results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of these
items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

From a business segment perspective, 3M achieved total sales growth in three business segments and organic local-currency sales growth (which includes
organic volume and selling price impacts) in all five business segments. Operating income margins were 22.4 percent, with all five business segments above
21 percent.
 
·
In Industrial, total sales decreased 0.3 percent, while organic local currency sales increased 2.5 percent, with organic sales growth in advanced
materials, industrial adhesives and tapes, separation and purification, abrasives, and automotive aftermarket. Operating income margins were
21.2 percent, up 1.6 percentage points, with 1.2 percentage points of this increase driven by benefits from expenses related to portfolio and
footprint actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 that were not repeated in the fourth quarter of 2018.
·
In Safety and Graphics, total sales increased 0.3 percent, or 3.3 percent on an organic local currency basis. Organic sales increased in personal
safety and commercial solutions while organic sales declined in transportation safety and roofing granules. Operating income margins were 22.0
percent, down 3.9 percentage points, with 2.8 percentage points of this decrease driven by year-on-year impact of 2017 divestiture gains,
partially offset by acquisitions and portfolio and footprint actions that were not repeated in 2018.
·
In Health Care, total sales increased 2.4 percent, or 4.8 percent on an organic local currency sales basis. Organic sales were led by food safety,
health information systems, medical solutions, and oral care. Organic sales declined in drug delivery systems. Operating income margins were
30.2 percent, down 0.8 percentage points.
·
In Electronics and Energy, total sales decreased 4.5 percent, while organic local currency sales increased 4.1 percent. Electronics-related total
sales increased 2.1 percent, or 3.2 percent on an organic local currency basis, with increases in both electronics materials solutions and display
materials and systems. Energy-related total sales decreased 22.7 percent, while organic sales increased 4.5 percent, driven by growth in electrical
markets. Operating income margins were 29.5 percent, up 3.5 percentage points, with 1.9 percentage points of this increase related to the impact
of the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division.
·
In Consumer, total sales increased 0.1 percent, or 1.9 percent on an organic local currency basis. Organic sales grew in home improvement and
stationery and office, while home care, and consumer health care declined. Operating income margins

were 21.3 percent, down 1.1 percentage points, which included an increase of 0.5 percentage points related to 2017 portfolio and footprint actions
that were not repeated in 2018.

Additional information beyond what is included in the preceding table is as follows:
 
·
In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China/Hong Kong total sales decreased 3 percent, driven by foreign currency translation impacts, while
organic local-currency sales increased 1 percent. In Japan, total sales and organic local-currency sales were flat.
·
In the EMEA geographic area, West Europe total sales decreased 7 percent due to the impact of lost sales from divested businesses in addition to
foreign currency translation impacts, while organic local-currency sales were flat.
·
In the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 1 percent in Mexico, or 5 percent on an organic local currency basis. In
Canada, total sales were flat, as organic local currency sales growth of 5 percent was offset by foreign currency translation impacts and lost sales
from divested businesses. In Brazil, total sales decreased 11 percent, as organic local-currency sales growth of 5 percent was more than offset by
foreign currency translation impacts.
 
Foreign currency translation decreased year-on-year sales by 2.3 percent, with the translation-related sales decreases in Latin America/Canada, EMEA and
Asia Pacific. Selling prices increased by 1.4 percent year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2018, with strong price growth in Latin America/Canada, EMEA
and the U.S. In Asia Pacific, price increases were lower compared to other geographic areas, as strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact
on price.

Additional information beyond what is included in the preceding table is as follows:
 
·
In the Asia Pacific geographic area, where 3M’s Electronics and Energy business is concentrated, sales benefited from strengthened demand
across most electronics market segments, in addition to strong growth in 3M’s Safety and Graphics business. Total sales in China/Hong Kong
grew 16 percent and Japan grew 5 percent. On an organic local-currency sales basis, China/Hong Kong grew 18 percent and Japan grew 8
percent.
·
In the EMEA geographic area, West Europe total sales grew 5 percent, with organic local-currency sales growth of 3 percent along with an
increase related to foreign currency translation.
·
In the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 4 percent in Mexico, as organic local-currency sales growth of 6 percent was
partially offset by divestitures. In Canada, total sales increased 8 percent, with organic-local currency sales growth of 7 percent. In Brazil total
sales growth of 9 percent was driven by foreign currency translation, while organic local-currency sales increased 2 percent.

Table of Contents
 
Foreign currency translation increased year-on-year sales by 0.5 percent, with the translation-related sales increase in Latin America/Canada and EMEA
partially offset by the decreases in Asia Pacific. Selling prices were flat year-on-year for 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in electronics had a
negative impact on price. Latin America/Canada and EMEA had price growth, while the U.S. selling prices declined slightly.
 
Financial condition:
 
3M generated $6.4 billion of operating cash flow in 2018, an increase of $199 million when compared to 2017. This followed a decrease of $422 million
when comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash
flows. In November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, which replaced the
Company’s February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own
stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock
in 2019. In February 2019, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the
61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an A1
credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital
markets funding throughout business cycles.
 
Raw materials:
 
In 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy
productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and
multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the
Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future
shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful
management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources.
3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.
 
 
Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:
 
On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 89 percent funded at year-end 2018. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is
approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded. The U.S.
non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2018 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were -
0.5%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified
pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2018
discount rate was 4.36%, up 0.68 percentage points from the year-end 2017 discount rate of 3.68%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a
decrease valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan’s funded status increased 2 percentage points in 2018
due to the lower PBO resulting from the significant discount rate increase and a $200 million contribution to the plan. Additional detail and discussion of
international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).
 
3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2019. The
Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and
postretirement expense in 2019 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $130 million pre-tax
when compared to 2018. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional
information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.

2019 closed acquisitions:
 
In February 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of the technology business of M*Modal for cash of approximately $0.7 billion, subject to closing and other
adjustments, and assumption of approximately $0.3 billion of M*Modal’s debt. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, M*Modal is a leading healthcare
technology provider of cloud-based, conversational artificial intelligence-powered systems that help physicians efficiently capture and improve the patient
narrative. The transaction will be reflected within the Company’s Health Care business.

Operating income margins decreased in 2018 versus 2017, driven primarily by the charge related to the Minnesota NRD resolution (as discussed in the
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
 section below). A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material
cost management, portfolio and footprint actions, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement service cost effects.
Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement service cost expense is
recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M’s
defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense increased $21 million in 2018, compared to an increase of $16 million in 2017. Refer to
Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.
 
The Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business
transformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well
as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.
 
Cost of Sales:
 
Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.
 
Cost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased during 2018 primarily due to foreign currency effects (net of hedge losses). Additionally, cost of
sales for full year 2018 were increased by the second quarter 2018 and fourth quarter 2018 Communication Markets Division related restructuring charges
as discussed in Note 5. This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018, and
selling price increases. Selling prices increased net sales year-on-year by 1.1 percent for full year 2018. These were partially offset by raw material cost
increases and higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense.
 
Cost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity, portfolio actions and footprint
optimization, foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher defined benefit pension expense. This was partially offset by a year-on-year
reduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing cost reduction projects. Selling prices were flat year-on-year for the full year 2017.
27
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
 
SG&A in dollars increased 14.7 percent for full year 2018 when compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily associated with the
Communication Markets Division-related restructuring charges (as discussed in Note 5) and the charge related to the Minnesota NRD resolution (as
discussed earlier in the “
Operating income, operating income margin, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted
for impacts of the Minnesota NRD resolution and the measurement period adjustment to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)
- (non-GAAP measures)
” section and further in Note 16). This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization
charges that did not repeat in 2018.
 
Research, Development and Related Expenses:
 
R&D in dollars decreased $49 million for full year 2018 when compared to the same period last year. The decrease primarily relates to R&D no longer
incurred related to the Communication Markets Division, which was primarily divested in the second quarter of 2018 and completed in the fourth quarter of
2018. 3M continued to invest in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets
and disrupt existing markets. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.6 percent in 2018, compared to 5.9 percent in 2017 and 2016.
 
Gain on Sale of Businesses:
 
In the first quarter of 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress
monitoring. In addition, 3M divested a polymer additives compounding business, formerly part of the Company’s Industrial business, and reflected a gain
on final closing adjustments from a prior divestiture which, in aggregate, were not material. These divestitures resulted in a gain on sale of businesses of
$24 million. 3M also divested an abrasives glass products business, formerly part of the Company’s Industrial business, which resulted in a gain on sale of
less than $15 million in the second quarter of 2018. Also, 3M reflected an immaterial gain from an earnout on a previous divestiture in the fourth quarter of
2018.
 
In June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated. This business, with annual sales
of approximately $400 million, consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry including 3M’s
xDSL, FTTx, and structured cabling solutions and, in certain countries, telecommunications system integration services. This divestiture resulted in a gain
on sale of $494 million. In December 2018, the Company completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services portion of
the business based in Germany, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million. Both the June 2018 and December 2018 divestiture impacts were reported within
the Company’s Electronics and Energy business.
 
Refer to Note 3 for additional detail on these divestitures. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2017 and 2016, resulting in gains of $586 million and $111
million, respectively. Refer to Note 3 for additional detail on these divestitures.
 
Operating Income Margin:
 
3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Refer to the table below for a reconciliation of operating
income margins for 2018 and 2017.

Year 2018 and fourth quarter operating income:
 
Operating income margins were flat in the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and declined 2.3 percentage points in full
year 2018 when compared to full year 2017.
 
Additional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in operating income margins follows:
 
2017 divestiture of identity management business:
·
Operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to the gain on the May 2017 divestiture of the Company’s former identity management
business.
 
Organic volume/productivity and other:
·
Operating income margins increased year-on-year due to benefits from organic local-currency growth and productivity, in addition to lower year-
on-year portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges.
·
Operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined
contribution expense.
 
Acquisitions/other divestiture gains:
·
Acquisition impacts (primarily related to Scott Safety), in addition to lower year-on-year divestiture gains (excluding the identity management
business and Communication Markets), decreased operating margins year-on-year.
·
Remaining stranded costs to be addressed from the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division reduced operating margins year-on-year.
·
Operating income margins increased year-on-year due to the lost lower-margin operating income from divested businesses.
 
Selling price and raw material impact:
·
Higher selling prices, partially offset by raw material cost increases, benefited operating income margins year-on-year.
 
Foreign exchange impacts:
·
Foreign currency effects (net of hedge gains) increased operating margins year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2018, but decreased operating
income margins year-on-year for the full year 2018.
 
29
 
Table of Contents
 
Legal-related charges:
·
In the second quarter of 2018, 3M reached agreements in principle on a number of respiratory mask/asbestos claims and an oral care product
liability matter, the implications of which resulted in an increase in certain legal accruals. Refer to Note 16 for further details.
 
2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions:
·
In June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $494 million as a
result of this divestiture. Additionally in December 2018, completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services
portion of the business based in Germany and reflected a pre-tax gain of $15 million as a result of this divestiture. Both divestitures were
reported within the Company’s Electronics and Energy business.  During the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, management approved
and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets
Division divestiture. These actions resulted in a second quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $105 million and a fourth quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of
$22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates.
 
MN NRD Resolution:
·
Operating income margins for full year 2018 decreased 2.3 percentage points year-on-year. Excluding the first quarter 2018 impact of the
Minnesota NRD resolution (as discussed earlier in the “
Operating income, operating income margin, income before taxes, net income, earnings
per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Minnesota NRD resolution and the measurement period adjustment to the impact of
the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures)
” section and further in Note 14), operating margins increased 0.4
percentage points year-on-year for full year 2018.
 
Year 2017 operating income:
 
Operating income margins increased 1.0 percentage points for the full year 2017 when compared to the same period last year.
 
2017 divestiture of identity management business:
·
Operating income margins increased year-on-year due to the gain on the May 2017 divestiture of the Company’s former identity management
business.
 
Organic volume/productivity and other:
·
Operating income benefited from higher organic local-currency sales growth and productivity, partially offset by actuarial adjustments to the
Company’s respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual.
·
Operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher year-on-year defined benefit pension service cost expense.
·
Operating margins also decreased due to incremental strategic investments in growth, productivity and portfolio actions, in addition to charges
related to 3M’s optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint.
 
Acquisitions/other divestiture gains:
·
Acquisitions and divestitures consist of the transactions and integration costs, net of income, that relate to the acquisition of Scott Safety, in
addition to the year-on-year divestiture gains (other than identity management business, refer to Note 3) and non-repeating operating losses from
divested businesses, which combined, benefited operating income margins for the full year 2017.
 
Selling price and raw material impact:
·
3M benefited from raw material sourcing cost reduction projects year-on-year.
 
Foreign exchange impacts:
·
Foreign currency effects (net of hedge gains) decreased operating income margins year-on-year.
 
Other Expense (Income), Net:
 
See Note 6 for a detailed breakout of this line item.

Table of Contents
 
Interest expense increased during 2018 and 2017 due to higher average debt balances and higher U.S. borrowing costs. In addition, in October 2017, via
cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment
charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included within interest expense. Capitalized interest related to property, plant and
equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.
 
Interest income increased year-on-year in both 2018 and 2017 due to higher average interest rates.
 
Effective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with 3M’s adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, all pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost components
(except the service cost component) are reported within other expense (income), net. For additional details, refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting
Policies). Year-on-year pension and postretirement net periodic benefit non-service costs increased $55 million and $68 million for the year 2018 and 2017,
respectively. The year-on-year increases were primarily due to an increase in the net actuarial amortization expense.

The effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.4 percent, compared to 35.5 percent in 2017, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2017 was
35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many
factors, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017 as further described in the Overview, “
Income, earnings per
share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -(non-GAAP measures)” 
section and in Note 10. During the fourth
quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. As a result of finalizing estimates related to TCJA,
the Company recorded additional net charges in the amount of $176 million as measurement period adjustments in 2018. The expense is primarily related to
the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and
liabilities.
 
The TCJA establishes new tax laws that affected 2018 and will affect future periods, including, but not limited to: 1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate
tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, 2) the creation of a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), 3) addition of
provisions incentivizing foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), 4) significant change to the U.S. federal tax implications of dividends, 5) limitations on
the deductibility of certain executive compensation, and 6) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction. Considering the impacts of the TCJA
and other factors, the Company currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2019 will be approximately 20 to 22 percent. The tax rate can vary from quarter
to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, and employee share-based payment accounting; as well as
recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.
 
Refer to Note 10 for further discussion of income taxes.

Currency Effects:
 
3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $42 million and $111 million in 2018 and 2017,
respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the
transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to
reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-

year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $92 million and $152 million in 2018 and 2017,
respectively. Refer to Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities. 
 
PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEG
 
MENT
 
For a detailed discussion of the markets served and types of products offered by 3M’s business segments, see Item 1, Business Segments. Financial
information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, as part of 3M’s
continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes:
 
Consolidation of customer account activity within international countries – expanding dual credit reporting
·
The Company consolidated its customer account activity in each country into centralized sales districts for certain countries that make up
approximately 70 percent of 3M’s 2017 international net sales. Expansion of these initiatives, which previously had been deployed only in the
U.S., reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual
credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides
customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. The expansion of alignment of customer accounts within
additional countries increased the attribution of dual credit across 3M’s business segments. Additionally, certain sales and operating income
results for electronic bonding product lines that were previously equally divided between the Electronics and Energy business segment and the
Industrial business segment are now reported similarly to dual credit.
 
Centralization of manufacturing and supply technology platforms
·
Certain shared film manufacturing and supply technology platform resources formerly reflected within the Electronics and Energy business
segment were combined with other shared and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated.
 
In addition, as discussed in Note 1, 3M adopted ASU No. 2017-07, 
Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost
, effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. As a result, operating income for 3M’s business segments has been revised
to reflect non-service components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs within other expense (income), net.
 
Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five business
segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer.
 
Corporate and Unallocated:
 
In addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding
business segments table and in Note 18. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and
losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring
charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its
business segments. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other
arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of
miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $1.1 billion in full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. Beginning in the second quarter
of 2018, the operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in Corporate and
Unallocated. In addition, in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, operating expenses included the restructuring charge of $105 million and $22
million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates, respectively, as discussed in Note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following
the Communication Markets Division divestiture. In the first quarter of 2018, the Minnesota NRD resolution ($897 million), inclusive of legal fees and
other related
32
 
Table of Contents
 
obligations, was reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement service-cost expense allocation to
Corporate and Unallocated increased year-on-year.
 
Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $74 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. In both the first and second quarters of 2017, a
portion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the fourth quarter, an incremental $58 million was reflected within
Corporate and Unallocated related to the Company’s actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual. In addition, 3M’s defined benefit
pension and postretirement service cost expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased by approximately $30 million in 2017. 
 
Operating Business Segments:
 
Information related to 3M’s business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Organic local-currency sales include both organic volume impacts plus
selling price impacts. Acquisition and divestiture impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. Foreign currency

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AR
 
EA
 
While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also
utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to
3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different
geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular
geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic
areas is provided in Note 19.
 
Refer to the “Overview” section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment.

efficiency. In 2018, 63% of 3M’s capital spending was within the United States, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Latin
America/Canada. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales
in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes.
Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”
 
 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA
 
TES
 
Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement obligations, asset
impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the
Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.
 
Legal Proceedings:
 
The categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related
insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and
Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 16) for additional information
about such estimates.
 
 
Pension and Postretirement Obligations:
 
 
3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The
primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension
and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, 
Compensation —
Retirement Benefits
, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires
employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of
financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income,
which is a component of stockholders’ equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are
39
 
Table of Contents
 
appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial
instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in
determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
 
Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or
termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of
the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period
and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments
that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately
using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to
the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit
payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in
the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
 
Using this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:

Another significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is
based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management.
For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%, a decrease from 7.25% in 2018.
Refer to Note 13 for information on how the 2018 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement
benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average
expected return for the international pension plan is 4.90% for 2019, compared to 5.02% for 2018.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of
$483 million and a benefit of $73 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special
termination benefits and other) for a total 
 
consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $410 million, up from $334 million in
2017.
 
In 2019, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $420 million while non-service pension and
postretirement net benefit costs (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $140
million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $280 million, a decrease of approximately $130 million
compared to 2018.
 
The table below summarizes the impact on 2019 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease
in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2018 net periodic benefit cost. The
table assumes all other factors are held constant, including the slope of the discount rate yield curves.

Asset Impairments:
 
As of December 31, 2018, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.7 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $2.7 billion. Management
makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This
includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are
closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an
impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.
 
Of the $2.7 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520
million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating
the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to
estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated
royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book
value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter
of 2018, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent
in aggregate.
 
3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of
each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level
below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At
3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.
 
An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit,
and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a
price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for
stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted
cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method
indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than
planned due to economic or other conditions.
 
As described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in
reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the
first quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and
determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2018 annual impairment test and is in the context of
the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.
 
As of October 1, 2018, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 89 percent of the goodwill. These ten
reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health
Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and
Transportation Safety. The estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 79 percent or more. 3M’s market
value at both December 31, 2018, and September 30, 2018, was significantly in excess of its shareholders’ equity of approximately $10 billion.
 
As discussed in Note 3, 3M sold its Communication Markets division in 2018, which comprised substantially all of the $272 million reduction in goodwill
associated with divestitures during 2018.
 
In 2018, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis. Where applicable, 3M used a
weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were
41
 
Table of Contents
 
weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management’s estimates of the
likelihood of each scenario occurring.
 
3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M’s
businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised
of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2018, no goodwill
impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.
 
Factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive
conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of
this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first
quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting
units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M
would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in
2019 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.
 
 
Income Taxes:
 
The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of
jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of
disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The
Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for
additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the
Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these
amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period
when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
 
Starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continuing into 2018, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and remeasurement of
3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. As discussed in Note 10, this expense was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI
 
TY
 
The strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company
to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital
deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be
supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for
cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund
dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities
for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those
international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S.
operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
 
3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to
the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum
maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2018, there was approximately $435 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.
 
Total Debt:
 
The strength of 3M’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s
maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA-
credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service.
 
The Company’s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September
2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency
effects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal
amount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year
end 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” section.
 
Effective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate
amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in
connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time)
of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous
aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012,
2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and the 2018 debt referenced above, is approximately $15.3 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of
issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note
12.
 
In March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year
revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion
(at lenders’ discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75 billion
credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is
calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on
all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at
December 31, 2018. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:
 
At December 31, 2018, 3M had $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $160 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other
high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries
and by the United States totaled approximately $3.975 billion and $180 million, respectively. Specifics concerning marketable securities investments are
provided in Note 11.
 
Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):
 
Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines
net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to
investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt
as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs.
Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by
other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors
as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.
 
Working capital decreased $125 million compared with December 31, 2017. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $568 million,
driven by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories (discussed
further below). Current liability balance changes increased working capital by $443 million, primarily due to decreases in short-term debt.
 
Accounts receivable increased $109 million from December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased sales. Foreign currency impacts decreased December 31,
2018 accounts receivable by $166 million and divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased accounts receivable by $29 million. Inventory increased $332
million from December 31, 2017, impacted by maintenance of additional inventory during
44
 
Table of Contents
 
the deployment in the U.S. of the Company’s ERP system. Foreign currency impacts decreased December 31, 2018 inventory by $154 million and
divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased inventory by $23 million.
 
Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a
substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average
invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is
provided in the below table.
 
In 2018, ROIC of 22.2 percent was higher than 2017. 
 
The increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was negatively impacted by the measurement period
adjustments taken in 2018 to the expense recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA, the impact from the resolution of the Minnesota
natural resource damages (NRD) resolution, and the impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions
related to addressing corporate functional costs following the divestiture, which combined reduced ROIC by 2 percentage points in 2018.
 
In 2017, ROIC of 21.3 percent was lower than 2016. This decrease related to the net impact of the enactment of the TCJA and increases in commercial
paper borrowings in conjunction with the December 2017 U.S. defined benefit pension plan contribution, which combined reduced ROIC by 3 percentage
points in 2017.

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items
can significantly impact cash flows.
 
In 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $199 million compared to the same period last year, with the increase primarily made up of
higher net income and lower year-on-year pension and postretirement contributions. The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD
resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were
increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by
$406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided
earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.
 
In 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash
flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S.
defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of
accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108
million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million.

Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing
efficiency. The Company expects 2019 capital spending to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.
 
3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating
pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to
capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as
information technology (IT) and laboratory facilities.
 
Refer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic
alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2018 primarily relate to the sale of 3M’s
Communication Markets Division and the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress
monitoring within the Safety and Graphics business segment.
 
Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily
attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale.
Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit
insurance, plus investments in equity securities.

2018 Debt Activity:
 
Total debt was approximately $14.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and $13.9 billion at December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to the third quarter
2018 issuance of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes, which was partially offset by the $450 million third quarter repayment and 500 million Euro fourth
quarter repayment of maturing medium-term notes, the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency
effects, and lower year on year commercial paper balance. Outstanding commercial paper was $435 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $745
million at December 31, 2017. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in
“Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. 3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper
issuances.
 
Proceeds from debt for 2018 primarily relate to the September 2018, issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3-year fixed rate medium-term
notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of 3.00%, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2024 with a coupon
rate of 3.25%, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year floating rate medium-term notes due 2024 with a rate based on a floating three-month
LIBOR index, $600 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2028 with a coupon rate of 3.625%, and $650 million
aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2048 with a coupon rate of 4.00%. 
Refer to Note 12 for more detail of these debt
issuances.

Table of Contents
 
2017 Debt Activity:
 
The Company’s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Increases in debt related to October 2017
debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of
international subsidiaries. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the
October 2017 $305 million debt tender. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected
in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances.
 
Proceeds from debt for 2017 primarily related to the October 2017 issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term
notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 2.25%, $850 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2027 with a coupon
rate of 2.875%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%. Refer to
Note 12 for more detail of these debt issuances.
 
In October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $110 million of its
$330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its $750 million principal amount of 5.70% notes due 2037. The Company
recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest expense associated with the differential between
the carrying value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses.
 
2016 Debt Activity:
 
Total debt at December 31, 2016 increased $853 million when compared to year-end 2015, with the increase primarily due to May 2016 debt issuances
(approximately $1.1 billion at issue date exchange rates) and September 2016 debt issuances of approximately $1.75 billion. This increase was partially
offset by the repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes due September 2016 along with the net impact of repayments and
borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea (approximately $0.8 million decrease), which is reflected in “Change in short-term
debt—net” in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances.
 
Proceeds from debt for 2016 primarily related to the May 2016 issuance of 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 5.75-year fixed rate medium-
term notes due February 2022 with a coupon rate of 0.375% and 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed rate medium-term notes due
2031 with a coupon rate of 1.50%. In September 2016, 3M issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due
2021 with a coupon rate of 1.625%, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2026 with a coupon rate of
2.250%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2046 with a coupon rate of 3.125%. All of these 2016
issuances were under the medium-term notes program (Series F). 
 
Repurchases of Common Stock:
 
Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In
November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, which replaced the
Company’s February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own
stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion and $3.8 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company expects full-year 2019 gross share repurchases
to be between $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. The
Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.
 
Dividends Paid to Shareholders:
 
Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $3.193 billion ($5.44 per share) in 2018, $2.803 billion ($4.70 per share) in 2017, and $2.678 billion ($4.44 per
share) in 2016. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2019, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an
increase of 6 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.76 per share and marked the 61st consecutive year of dividend increases.

Table of Contents
 
Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital
leases. In addition, in 2017, this included a payment related to the $96 million in interest expense associated with premiums and fees for the early retirement
of debt. See Note 12 for additional details.
 
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):
 
Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be
considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used
by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It
should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as
free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as
they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate
cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and
free cash flow conversion for 2018, 2017 and 2016.
 
In 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from
the enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax impact related to the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381
million pre-tax impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional
costs following the divestiture. On a combined basis, these items reduced free cash flow conversion by 2 percentage points.
 
In 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M
made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points. Refer to the
preceding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” section for discussion of additional items that impacted operating cash flow. Refer to the preceding
“Cash Flows from Investing Activities” section for discussion on capital spending for property, plant and equipment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section
entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 16 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
 
In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major
customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M
personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M’s maximum exposure under these
indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.

Long-term debt payments due in 2019 and 2020 include floating rate notes totaling $124 million and $95 million, respectively, as a result of put provisions
associated with these debt instruments.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily
related to the TCJA’s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer. As discussed in Note 10, this balance was
finalized in 2018.
 
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company.
Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service
agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase
obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure
availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional
purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s
expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for
which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment.
For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
 
Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other,” include the current portion of
the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is
not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the
long-term portion of the total net tax liability of $655 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details.
 
As discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019 and Company
contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are
not included in the preceding table.
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMEN
 
TS
 
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and
floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal
amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.

Table of Contents
 
Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk,
commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.
 
Item 7A. 
Quantitative
 
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
In the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest
rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management provides oversight for risk
management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative
instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit
approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.
 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and
forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to
credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The
Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.
 
Foreign Exchange Rates Risk:
 
Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations
in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in
foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the
occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the
forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to
offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing
transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging
instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s
foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2018. The
dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $2.5
billion at December 31, 2018. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had 4.1 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency
denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the “Net Investment
Hedges” section.
 
Interest Rates Risk:
 
The Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense
using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges.
Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by
reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional
amount of the Company’s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 was $2.4 billion. Additional details about 3M’s long-term debt can be found in Note
12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company’s
long-term debt.
 
Commodity Prices Risk:
 
The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. The related
mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in
the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation
and costs associated with the use of certain commodities and
51
 
Table of Contents
 
precious metals. These instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were outstanding at December 31, 2018 was not
material.
 
Value At Risk:
 
The value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company’s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A
Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and
underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2018. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time
horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and commodity prices related to five
commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge
transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse
and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.

In addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates, recent historical information is as
follows. 3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $42 million and $111 million in 2018
and 2017, respectively. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on
the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to
reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by
approximately $92 million and $152 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
An analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price change would result
in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $75 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-
tax cost or savings of approximately $42 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities,
primarily electricity and natural gas.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 3M Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017,
and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated
Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
 
Basis for Opinions
 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
 
NOTE 1.  Significant Accounting Policies
 
 
Consolidation:
 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All subsidiaries are consolidated.
All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context
indicates otherwise.
 
Foreign currency translation:
 Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Assets and liabilities for
operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at
month-end exchange rates of each applicable month. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.
 
3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela, the financial statements of which are remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent because Venezuela’s
economic environment is considered highly inflationary. The operating income of this subsidiary is immaterial as a percent of 3M’s consolidated operating
income for 2018. The Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local
currency. The government has also operated various expanded secondary currency exchange mechanisms that have been eliminated and replaced from time
to time. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. For the periods presented, the financial statements of 3M’s Venezuelan
subsidiary were remeasured utilizing the rate associated with the secondary auction mechanism, Tipo de Cambio Complementario, which was redesigned
by the Venezuelan government in June 2017 (DICOM), or its predecessor. During the same periods, the Venezuelan government’s official exchange was
Tipo de Cambio Protegido (DIPRO), or its predecessor. During the third quarter of 2018, the Venezuelan government effected a conversion of its currency
to the Sovereign Bolivar (VES), essentially equating to its previous Venezuelan Bolivar divided by 100,000. 3M’s uses of these rates were based upon
evaluation of a number of factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert
currency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing and obtaining currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the
Company’s intent and ability to use a particular exchange mechanism. The Company continues to monitor these circumstances. Changes in applicable
exchange rates or exchange mechanisms may continue in the future. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of net monetary liabilities
denominated in VES of approximately 30 million VES and the DICOM exchange rate was approximately 556 VES per U.S. dollar.
 
A need to deconsolidate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated cash coupled
with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M monitors factors such as its
ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company’s ability to manage its Venezuelan subsidiary’s
capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and economic situation within Venezuela. Based upon a review
of factors as of December 31, 2018, the Company continues to consolidate its Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of
accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with this subsidiary was approximately $145 million and the amount of intercompany receivables due
from this subsidiary and its total equity balance were not significant.
 
3M has subsidiaries in Argentina, the operating income of which is less than one half of one percent of 3M’s consolidated operating income for 2018.
Based on various indices, Argentina’s cumulative three-year inflation rate exceeded 100 percent in the second quarter of 2018, thus being considered highly
inflationary. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the financial statements of the Argentine subsidiaries were remeasured as if their functional
currency were that of their parent. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of net monetary assets denominated in Argentine pesos (ARS) of
approximately 230 million ARS and the exchange rate was approximately 38 ARS per U.S. dollar.
 
Use of estimates:
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
Cash and cash equivalents:
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.
61
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Marketable securities:
 Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in,
first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M
reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320
, Investments-Debt and
Equity Securities
, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-temporary”. A temporary impairment charge results
in an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not
reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate
between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the
underlying collateral, as well as other factors. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or
“other-than-temporary” impairment.
 
Investments:
 
As described in the “New Accounting Pronouncements” section, 3M adopted ASU No. 2016-01, 
Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities
, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, all equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for
under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity
investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price
changes in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7
.
 
Other assets: 
Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and
other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any
changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated
with life insurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable
securities and investments,” respectively.
 
Inventories:
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
 
 
Property, plant and equipment:
 Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. The
estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. Fully
depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts
until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal,
is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of
an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the
impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted
cash flow analysis.
 
Conditional asset retirement obligations: 
A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations
exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the
liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related
assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $122 million and $106 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Goodwill: 
Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between
annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done
at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting
62
 
Table of Contents
 
units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic
characteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying
value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The estimated fair
value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a
discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not
“more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill
assessments.
 
Intangible assets: 
Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an
independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from three to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis
(generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between ten to
seventeen years, patents largely between four to thirteen years, other technology-based largely between five to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames
largely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely between five to thirteen years. Intangible assets are removed from their respective
gross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and
accumulated amortization of the Company’s intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as
incurred, within “Research, development and related expenses.”
 
Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group)
may not be recoverable. 
 
An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or
asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of
the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
 
Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually,
and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be
impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.
 
Restructuring actions:
 Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs,
and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon
distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts
are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees were required to
render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable
employees and recognized as expense over the employees’ remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to
terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will
continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset impairment charges related to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.
 
Revenue (sales) recognition:
 
3M adopted ASU No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, and other related ASUs (collectively, ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition approach. See additional disclosure relative to
adoption of this ASU in Note 2.
 
The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or
significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M’s customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer
manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not
distinct.
 
However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance
obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.
 
63
 
Table of Contents
 
Revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company’s customer arrangements, control transfers to
customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of
goods/services transfers to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the
benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).
 
Revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable
consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates,
trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely
amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes.
The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across
businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.
There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an
expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal
course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other
excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.
 
For substantially all arrangements recognized over time, the Company applies the “right to invoice” practical expedient. As a result, 3M recognizes revenue
at the invoice amount when the entity has a right to invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the
Company’s performance completed to date.
 
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3M’s best
estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
 
The Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous
periods.
 
The Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years
presented. Additionally, the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any
year presented.
 
3M applies ASC 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:
·
Exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less.
·
Practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would
have been one year or less.
·
Portfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration.
·
“Right to invoice” practical expedient based on 3M’s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the
customer of 3M’s performance completed to date.
·
Election to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.
·
Sales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required
remaining performance obligations disclosure.
 
Accounts receivable and allowances: 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains
allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the
best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns. The Company determines the allowances
based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and historical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for
doubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
 
Advertising and merchandising:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $396 million in 2018, $411 million in 2017 and
$385 million in 2016.
64
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Research, development and related expenses:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.821 billion in 2018, $1.870 billion in 2017 and $1.764 billion in
2016. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion in 2018, $1.352 billion in 2017 and $1.248 billion in 2016. Related expenses primarily include
technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of
externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved
investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.
 
 
Internal-use software:
 The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use
software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational
basis is more representative of the software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or capital leases within
property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated
depreciation accounts.
 
Environmental:
 Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably
estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies.
Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
 
Income taxes:
 The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a
valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company
had valuation allowances of $67 million and $81 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax
positions based on the rules under ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
.
 
Earnings per share:
 The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M
common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these
stock-based compensation plans during the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M
common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (2.9 million average options for 2018, 0.8 million average options for 2017, and
3.6 million average options for 2016). The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

Stock-based compensation: 
The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under applicable
accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over
the period in which the share-based compensation vests. However, with respect
65
 
Table of Contents
 
to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the award’s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value
upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax
benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax
benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash
flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and
employee stock option exercises.
 
Comprehensive income:
 Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and
postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow
hedging instruments.
 
Derivatives and hedging activities:
 All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are recorded on the balance sheet at
fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks
generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting
are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to
exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for
hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement
of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.
 
Credit risk:
 The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity
price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors
its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as
counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master
netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate
derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of
derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master
netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
 
Fair value measurements:
 3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a
hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring
that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability
developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the
circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are
unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement.
 
Acquisitions: 
The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
.  This standard requires the acquiring
entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date
fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard
prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent
consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.

New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, and subsequently
issued additional ASUs amending this ASU thought 2017 (collectively, ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
). 
 
3M adopted ASC 606 on
January 1, 2018. The Company’s revenue recognition policy under ASC 606 is described earlier in Note 1 and related additional disclosures are included in
Note 2, Revenue. 3M adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative
net impact of adoption, the January 1, 2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $2 million, primarily relating to the accelerated
recognition for software installation service and training revenue.
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, 
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
, which revises the
accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for
financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The
new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other ownership interests in an entity, including investments in
partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies (collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not
accounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to measure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no
longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available-for-sale in other
comprehensive income (OCI). They also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily
determinable fair values. Instead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will
be permitted to elect a practicability exception and measure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly
transactions). The ASU also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial
liabilities for which the fair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in OCI the portion
of the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. This provision does not
apply to derivative instruments required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. For 3M, this standard was
effective beginning January 1, 2018 via an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for guidance relative to equity
securities without readily determinable fair values which is applied prospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results
of operations and financial condition.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases
, and in July 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-10 and 2018-11 and in December 2018, issued
ASU No. 2018-20, which amended the standard, replacing existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard introduces a lessee model that would
require entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current
accounting. The ASU does not make fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct
financing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as
evaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific
provisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019. As amended, the ASU provides
for retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods
presented. 3M does not plan on recasting prior periods as it adopts this ASU. 3M has conducted analyses, executed project management relative to the
process of adopting this ASU including implementing a new lease accounting system, conducted detailed contract reviews, considered expanded disclosure
requirements, and assessed internal controls impacts. Note 16 provides information regarding rent expense for operating leases and minimum lease
payments for capital and operating leases under existing lease guidance. While 3M will provide expanded disclosures as a result of ASU No. 2016-02, it
does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations. However, 3M expects to record approximately $0.8 billion
of lease assets and lease liabilities related to its operating leases and an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings related to transition upon this ASU’s
adoption in January 2019.
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, 
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
, which revises guidance for the accounting for
credit losses on financial instruments within its scope, and in November 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-19, which amended the standard. The new standard
introduces an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for
available-for-sale debt securities. The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most
financial assets measured at amortized cost and
67
 
Table of Contents
 
certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet
credit exposures. With respect to available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the ASU amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model. For such
securities with unrealized losses, entities will still consider if a portion of any impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a
reduction in income. However, rather than also reflecting that credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that AFS debt
security, the ASU requires that credit losses be reflected as an allowance. As a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in
previous allowances, or portions thereof, reversing back into income. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Entities
are required to apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in
which the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated result of operations and financial condition.
 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, 
Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory
, which modifies existing guidance and is
intended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets. The ASU indicates
that the current exception to income tax accounting that requires companies to defer the income tax effects of certain intercompany transactions would
apply only to intercompany inventory transactions. That is, the exception would no longer apply to intercompany sales and transfers of other assets (e.g.,
intangible assets). Under the existing exception, income tax expense associated with intra-entity profits in an intercompany sale or transfer of assets is
eliminated from earnings. Instead, that cost is deferred and recorded on the balance sheet (e.g., as a prepaid asset) until the assets leave the consolidated
group. Similarly, the entity is prohibited from recognizing deferred tax assets for the increases in tax bases due to the intercompany sale or transfer. For
3M, the ASU was effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated and the January 1,
2018 balance of retained earnings was decreased by less than $2 million.
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, 
Clarifying the Definition of a Business
, which narrows the existing definition of a business and
provides a framework for evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of assets or a business. The ASU requires
an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar
identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities (collectively, the set) is not a business. To be considered a business, the set would need
to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The standard also narrows the definition of
outputs. The definition of a business affects areas of accounting such as acquisitions, disposals and goodwill. Under the new guidance, fewer acquired sets
are expected to be considered businesses. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2018 on a prospective basis and the Company will apply this guidance
to applicable transactions after the adoption date.
 
In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05, 
Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of
Nonfinancial Assets
. This ASU addresses scope-related questions that arose after the FASB issued its revenue guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from
Contracts with Customers
. The new standard clarifies the accounting for derecognition of nonfinancial assets and defines what is considered an in
substance nonfinancial asset. Nonfinancial assets largely relate to items such as real estate, ships and intellectual property that do not constitute a business.
The new ASU impacts entities derecognizing (e.g. selling) nonfinancial assets (or in substance nonfinancial assets), including partial interests therein, when
the purchaser is not a customer. Under the new guidance, the seller would apply certain recognition and measurement principles of ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, even though the purchaser is not a customer. For 3M, this new standard was effective coincident with the
Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09.
 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, 
Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit
Cost
. This ASU changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost
in the income statement. Under the new standard, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost would be included in operating expenses and
only the service cost component would be eligible for capitalization into assets such as inventory. All other net periodic benefit costs components (such as
interest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) would be reported outside of operating income.
3M adopted this ASU is effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis; however, guidance limiting the capitalization to only the service cost component
is applied on prospective basis. The Company previously filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 8, 2018 (which updated 3M’s 2017 Annual Report
on Form 10-K) that provided prior period information reflecting the retrospective adoption of this ASU. The adoption had 
no impact on previously reported
income before income taxes and net income attributable to 3M. However, non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs in prior periods were
reclassified from operating expenses
68
 
Table of Contents
 
and are now reported outside of operating income within other expense (income), net. The financial information herein reflects these impacts for all periods
presented. The prospective impact on costs capitalized into assets was not material
.
 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08
, Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities
, which amends the amortization period
for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under existing standards, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of
yield over the contractual life of the instrument. The new guidance shortens the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain callable debt
securities that have explicit, noncontingent call features and are callable at a fixed price and preset date. The amendments do not require an accounting
change for securities held at a discount. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019 with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-
effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. 3M’s marketable security portfolio
includes very limited instances of callable debt securities held at a premium. As a result, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact
on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09
, Scope of Modification Accounting
, that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based
payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The general model for accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards is to record
the incremental value arising from the changes as additional compensation cost. Under the new standard, fewer changes to the terms of an award would
require accounting under this modification model. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2018. Because the Company does not typically make changes
to the terms or conditions of its issued share-based payment awards, 
 
the adoption of this ASU had no material impact on its consolidated results of
operations and financial condition.
 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-10, 
Determining the Customer of the Operation Services
, that clarifies how an operating entity determines
the customer of the operation services for transactions within the scope of a service concession arrangement. Service concession arrangements are typically
agreements between a grantor and an operating entity whereby the operating entity will operate the grantor’s infrastructure (i.e. airports, roadways, bridges,
and prisons) for a specified period of time. The operating entity also may be required to maintain the infrastructure and provide capital-intensive
maintenance to enhance or extend its life. In such arrangements, typically the operation services (i.e. operation and maintenance of a roadway) would be
used by third parties (i.e. drivers). The ASU clarifies that the grantor, not the third party, is the customer of the operation services in such arrangements. For
3M, this new standard was effective coincident with the Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. Because the Company is not typically a
party to agreements within the scope of accounting for service concession arrangements, the adoption of this ASU had no material impact on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, 
(Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement
of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable
Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception
. The new standard applies to issuers of financial instruments with down-round features. A down-round
provision is a term in an equity-linked financial instrument (i.e. a freestanding warrant contract or an equity conversion feature embedded within a host debt
or equity contract) that triggers a downward adjustment to the instrument’s strike price (or conversion price) if equity shares are issued at a lower price (or
equity-linked financial instruments are issued at a lower strike price) than the instrument’s then-current strike price. The purpose of the feature is typically
to protect the instrument’s counterparty from future issuances of equity shares at a more favorable price. The ASU amends (1) the classification of such
instruments as liabilities or equity by revising the certain guidance relative to evaluating if they must be accounted for as derivative instruments and (2) the
guidance on recognition and measurement of freestanding equity-classified instruments. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption
permitted. Because the Company has not issued financial instruments with down-round features, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on
its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, 
Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities 
and in October 2018, issued ASU No.
2018-16, which amended the standard. The ASU amends existing guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow
companies to better align their hedge accounting with their risk management activities. Existing standards contain certain requirements for an instrument to
qualify for hedge accounting relative to initial and ongoing assessments of hedge effectiveness. While an initial quantitative test to establish the hedge
relationship is highly effective would still be required, the new ASU permits subsequent qualitative assessments for certain hedges instead of a quantitative
test and expands the timeline for performing the initial quantitative assessment. The ASU also simplifies related accounting by eliminating the requirement
to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. Instead, for qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges, the entire change
69
 
Table of Contents
 
in fair value (including the amount attributable to ineffectiveness) will be recorded within other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the
same income statement line that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. For fair value hedges,
generally, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument would also be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The new
standard also simplifies the accounting for fair value hedges of interest rate risks and expands an entity’s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk
components. In addition, the guidance also eases certain documentation requirements, modifies the accounting for components excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness, and requires additional tabular disclosures of derivative and hedge-related information. For 3M, this ASU is effective
January 1, 2019, with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings as
of the adoption date. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, 
Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
, which
permits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising
from the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. An entity that elects to make this reclassification
must consider all items in AOCI that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as
well as the entity’s policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI. The ASU may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period
of adoption. For 3M, this ASU will be adopted effective January 1, 2019 and will result in a reclassification between retained earnings and AOCI. The
Company estimates that the impact from this ASU will increase retained earnings by approximately $0.9 billion, with an offsetting increase to accumulated
other comprehensive loss for the same amount.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, 
Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
, which largely aligns the measurement
and classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with the guidance for share-based payments to employees. The ASU also clarifies
that any share-based payment issued to a customer should be evaluated under ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. The ASU requires a
modified retrospective transition approach. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2019. Because the Company does not grant share-based payments
to nonemployees or customers, this ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-08, 
Clarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and Contributions Made
.
The ASU applies to entities that receive or make contributions, which primarily are not-for-profit entities but also affects business entities that make
contributions. In the context of business entities that make contributions, the FASB clarified that a contribution is conditional if the arrangement includes
both a barrier for the recipient to be entitled to the assets transferred and a right of return for the assets transferred (or a right of release of the business
entity’s obligation to transfer assets). The recognition of contribution expense is deferred for conditional arrangements and is immediate for unconditional
arrangements. The ASU requires modified prospective transition to arrangements that have not been completed as of the effective date or that are entered
into after the effective date, but full retrospective application to each period presented is permitted. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2019. The
Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, 
Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases
, which amends ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases
. The new
ASU includes certain clarifications to address potential narrow-scope implementation issues which the Company is incorporating into its assessment and
adoption of ASU No. 2016-02. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2016-02, which for 3M is January 1, 2019.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, 
Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements
, which amends ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases 
. The new ASU
offers an additional transition method by which entities may elect not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of
adoption and allows lessors to elect a practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components when certain conditions are met. This ASU has the
same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2016-02, which for 3M is January 1, 2019.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, 
Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement
, which eliminates, amends, and
adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amended and new disclosure requirements primarily relate to Level 3 fair value
measurements. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. The removal and amendment of certain disclosures may be early adopted with
retrospective application while the new disclosure requirements are to be applied
70
 
Table of Contents
 
prospectively. As this ASU relates only to disclosures, there will be no impact to the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, 
Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans
, which makes minor changes to the
disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The ASU requires a retrospective transition approach. The
Company elected to early adopt this ASU in the fourth quarter 2018 on a retrospective basis. As this ASU relates only to disclosures, there was no impact to
the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, 
Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That
Is a Service Contract
, which aligns the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement (i.e.
hosting arrangement) with the guidance on capitalizing costs in ASC 350-40, 
Internal-Use Software
. The ASU permits either a prospective or retrospective
transition approach. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. The Company is currently assessing this standard’s impact on its consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.
 
In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-16, 
Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a
Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes
, which adds the OIS rate based on the SOFR to the list of US benchmark interest rates in ASC
815 that are eligible to be hedged. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2017-12, which for 3M is January 1, 2019.
The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-17, 
Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities
, which changes how
entities evaluate decision-making fees under the variable interest guidance. Entities will consider indirect interests held through related parties under
common control on a proportionate basis rather than in their entirety. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. 3M does not have significant
involvement with entities subject to consolidation considerations impacted by variable interest entity model factors. As a result, the Company does not
expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-18, 
Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606
, which clarifies that certain
transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. The ASU
precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue from contracts with customers if the
counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. Further, the ASU amends ASC 808 to refer to the unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 and requires it to
be used only when assessing whether a transaction is in the scope of ASC 606. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. 3M has limited
collaborative arrangements. As a result, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.
 
In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, 
Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments
, which clarifies that receivables
arising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather, should be accounted for in accordance with the lease
standard. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2016-13, which for 3M is January 1, 2020.
 
The Company does not
expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 
In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-20, 
Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors,
 which amends ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases
. The new ASU
provides narrow-scope amendments to help lessors apply the new leases standard. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as
ASU No. 2016-02, which for 3M is January 1, 2019. 
The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of
operations and financial condition.
 
Note 2.  Revenue
 
 
The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 and related standards (collectively, ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
), on January 1, 2018 using
the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative net impact of adopting ASC 606, the January 1,
2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $2 million, primarily
71
 
Table of Contents
 
relating to the accelerated recognition for software installation service and training revenue. This cumulative impact reflects retrospective application of
ASC 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Further, the Company applied the practical expedient permitting the effect of all
contract modifications that occurred before January 1, 2018 to be aggregated in the transition accounting. The impact of applying ASC 606 as compared
with previous guidance applied to revenues and costs was not material for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Contract Balances:
Deferred revenue (current portion) as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $617 million and $513 million, respectively, and primarily relates
to revenue that is recognized over time for one-year software license contracts, the changes in balance of which are related to the satisfaction or partial
satisfaction of these contracts. The balance also contains a deferral for goods that are in-transit at period end for which control transfers to the customer
upon delivery. Approximately $500 million of the December 31, 2017 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. The
amount of noncurrent deferred revenue is not significant.

NOTE 3. 
Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
 
Acquisitions:
 
3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors, growth markets
and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired
businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses.
 
In addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do
not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.
 
There were no acquisitions that closed during 2018.
 
73

In February 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of the technology business of M*Modal for cash of approximately $0.7 billion, subject to closing and other
adjustments, and assumption of approximately $0.3 billion of M*Modal’s debt. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, M*Modal is a leading healthcare
technology provider of cloud-based, conversational artificial intelligence-powered systems that help physicians efficiently capture and improve the patient
narrative. The transaction will be reflected within the Company’s Health Care business.
 
2017 acquisitions:
 
In September 2017, 3M purchased all of the ownership interests of Elution Technologies, LLC, a Vermont-based manufacturer of test kits that help enable
food and beverage companies ensure their products are free from certain potentially harmful allergens such as peanuts, soy or milk. Elution is reported
within the Company’s Health Care business.
 
In October 2017, 3M completed the acquisition of the underlying legal entities and associated assets of Scott Safety, which is headquartered in Monroe,
North Carolina, from Johnson Controls for $2.0 billion of cash, net of cash acquired. Scott Safety is a premier manufacturer of innovative products,
including self-contained breathing apparatus systems, gas and flame detection instruments, and other safety devices that complement 3M’s personal safety
portfolio. The business had revenues of approximately $570 million in 2016. Scott Safety is reported within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business.
Adjustments in 2018 to the purchase price allocation were approximately $7 million and related to identification of certain immaterial acquired assets, tax-
related and contingent liabilities, and resolution of certain acquired working capital and other purchase price adjustments with the seller. The change to
provisional amounts did not result in material impacts to results of operations in 2018 or any portion related to earlier quarters in the measurement period.
The allocation of purchase consideration related to Scott Safety was completed in the third quarter of 2018
. 
 
Pro forma information related to acquisitions has not been included because the impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations was not
considered material. The following table shows the impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the purchase price allocations related to 2017 acquisitions
and assigned finite-lived intangible asset weighted-average lives.

Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2017 totaled $855 million. The associated finite-lived intangible assets
acquired in 2017 are amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life of 15 years (lives ranging from four
to 17 years). Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for which significant assumed renewals or extensions of
underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material.

2016 acquisitions:
 
In September 2016, 3M acquired all of the outstanding shares of Semfinder, headquartered in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. Semfinder is a leading developer
of precision software that enables efficient coding of medical procedures in multiple languages. The purchase price paid for these business combinations
(net of cash acquired) during 2016 aggregated to $16 million. Semfinder is reported within 3M’s Health Care business.
 
Adjustments in 2016 to the preliminary purchase price allocations of other acquisitions within the allocation period primarily related to the identification of
contingent liabilities and certain tax-related items aggregating to approximately $35 million along with other balances related to the 2015 acquisition of
Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. The change to provisional amounts resulted in an immaterial impact to the results of operations in the third quarter of 2016, a
portion of which related to earlier quarters in the measurement period.
 
Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2016 totaled $4 million. The associated finite-lived intangible assets
acquired in 2016 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life of 8 years (lives ranging from
two to 20 years). Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for which significant assumed renewals or extensions of
underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material.
 
Divestitures:
 
3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company’s portfolio considering, among other items, factors relative to the
extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in addition to considering if selling the businesses results in the
greatest value creation for the Company and for shareholders.
 
2018 divestitures:
In February 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring
to TSI, Inc. This business has annual sales of approximately $15 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of less than $20 million that was
reported within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, 3M divested a polymer additives compounding
business, formerly part of the Company’s Industrial business, and reflected a gain on final closing adjustments from a prior divestiture which, in aggregate,
were not material. In May 2018, 3M divested an abrasives glass products business, formerly part of the Company’s Industrial business, with annual sales of
approximately $10 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of less than $15 million. The Company also reflected an immaterial gain in the fourth
quarter from an earnout on a previous divestiture.
In June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated. This business, with annual sales
of approximately $400 million, consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry including 3M’s
xDSL, FTTx, and structured cabling solutions and, in certain countries, telecommunications system integration services. 3M received cash proceeds of $772
million and reflected a pre-tax gain of $494 million as a result of this divestiture. In December 2018, the Company completed the sale of the remaining
telecommunications system integration services portion of the business based in Germany, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million. Both the June 2018
and December 2018 divestiture impacts were reported within the Company’s Electronics and Energy business.
 
2017 divestitures:
In January 2017, 3M sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business, with annual sales of approximately $45 million, to HOYA Vision Care. The
Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $29 million in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of this sale, which was reported within the Company’s Safety and
Graphics business.
 
In May 2017, 3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable, of its identity management business to Gemalto N.V. This business, with
2016 sales of approximately $205 million, is a leading provider in identity management solutions, including biometric hardware and software that enable
identity verification and authentication, as well as secure materials and document readers. In June 2017, 3M also completed the sale of its tolling and
automated license/number plate recognition business, with annual sales of approximately $40 million, to Neology, Inc. 3M’s tolling and automated
license/number plate recognition business includes RFID readers and tags, automatic vehicle classification systems, lane controller and host software, and
back office software and services. It also provides mobile and fixed cameras, software, and services in automated license/number plate recognition. 3M

of $833 million, or $809 million net of cash sold, and reflected a pre-tax gain of $458 million as a result of these two divestitures, which was reported
within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business.
 
In October 2017, 3M sold its electronic monitoring business to an affiliate of Apax Partners. This business, with annual sales of approximately $95 million,

within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M sold the assets of an electrical marking/labeling business within its Electronics and Energy business. The former activity,
proceeds and gain were not considered material.
 
2016 divestitures:
In the first quarter of 2016, 3M completed the sale of the remainder of the assets of 3M’s library systems business to One Equity Partners Capital Advisors
L.P. (OEP). 3M had previously sold the North American business and the majority of the business outside of North America to OEP in the fourth quarter of
2015 which was reported within 3M’s Safety and Graphics business. Also in the first quarter of 2016, 3M sold to Innovative Chemical Products Group, a
portfolio company of Audax Private Equity, the assets of 3M’s pressurized polyurethane foam adhesives business (formerly known as Polyfoam). This

and industrial foam segments in the United States with annual sales of approximately $20 million and was reported within 3M’s Industrial business. The
Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $40 million in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the sales of these businesses.
 
In October 2016, 3M sold the assets of its temporary protective films business to Pregis LLC. This business, with annual sales of approximately $50

The aggregate operating income of these businesses was approximately $25 million, $40 million, and $50 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
The approximate amounts of major assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2018 were not
material. The amounts as of December 31, 2017, included the following:

There were no acquisitions that closed during 2018. Purchased goodwill from acquisitions totaled $1.3 billion in 2017, none of which is deductible for tax
purposes. The acquisition activity in the following table also includes the net impact of adjustments to the preliminary allocation of purchase price within
the one year measurement-period following prior acquisitions, which increased goodwill by $7 million during 2018. The amounts in the “Translation and
other” column in the following table primarily relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The goodwill balance by business segment follows:

Accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as a change in
reporting units or the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division.
 
As described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the
alignment of its businesses around markets and customers. For any product changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the
relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed
its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The
Company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018 for all reporting units and determined that no impairment existed.
In addition, the Company had no impairments of goodwill in 2016 or 2017.

Certain tradenames acquired by 3M are not amortized because they have been in existence for over 55 years, have a history of leading-market share
positions, have been and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an

million shares is authorized but unissued.
 
Cash dividends declared and paid totaled $1.36, $1.175 and $1.11 per share for each quarter in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which resulted in total
year declared and paid dividends of $5.44, $4.70 and $4.44 per share, respectively.
 
Transfer of Ownership Interest Involving Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries
 
During 2018, a wholly owned subsidiary in India was sold to 3M India Limited, which is 75 percent owned by the Company. Because the Company
retained its controlling interest in the subsidiary involved, the sale resulted in a deemed dividend to 3M, resulting in an increase in 3M Company
shareholders’ equity and a decrease in noncontrolling interest. Refer to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for further details.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal (approximately $3 million),
state (approximately $19 million), and international (approximately $50 million), with all amounts before limitation impacts and valuation allowances. The
federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 15 to 20 years, the state after 5 to 10 years, and the international after one to three years or have an
indefinite carryover period. The tax attributes being carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain
losses and foreign tax credits without the same type of taxable income. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has provided $67 million of valuation
allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on management’s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to
these assets will not be realized.

The effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.4 percent, compared to 35.5 percent in 2017, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points, impacted by several factors.
Primary factors that decreased the Company’s effective tax rate included favorable aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) including the decrease in
the U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to transition tax and remeasurement of
deferred tax assets/liabilities (further discussed below), increased benefits from the R&D tax credit, and favorable adjustment to prior year uncertain tax
provisions. These decreases were partially offset by the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income
(GILTI) provision, and lower excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments.
 
The effective tax rate for 2017 was 35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points, impacted by several factors.
Primary factors that increased the Company’s effective tax rate included the impacts due to the TCJA being enacted in 2017 (see further information below)
and remeasurements and establishment of 3M’s uncertain tax positions. The increase was partially offset by actions which related to international taxes that
were impacted by increasing benefits from the Company’s supply chain centers of expertise, changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and
prior year cash optimization actions, higher year-on-year excess tax benefit for employee share-based payment, increased benefits from the R&D tax credit,
a reduction of state taxes, and other items.
 
The TCJA was enacted in December 2017. Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent
beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax
deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. 
The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provided a
measurement period of up to one year from the TCJA’s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740.
 In connection with the
enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and additional net charges of $176 million as
measurement period adjustments in 2018. As further discussed below, 3M completed its accounting for the income tax effects of enactment of the TCJA as
follows:
 
Transition tax
: 3M recorded a provisional income tax expense obligation of $745 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, the Company
recorded an additional obligation of $97 million related to the transition tax portion of the TCJA. The TCJA’s transition
85
 
Table of Contents
 
tax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 3M reflected $649 million in long-term income taxes payable associated with
the transition tax.
 
Remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts:
 3M remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which
they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent under the TCJA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net income tax
expense of $17 million related to remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts. During 2018, 3M recorded an additional net tax
expense of $79 million as an associated measurement period adjustment.
 
3M has recorded current tax on GILTI relative to 2018 operations and will continue to account for GILTI as a period cost when incurred.
 
 
The IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 to 2014, and 2016, but the years have not
closed as the Company is in the process of resolving open issues. The Company remains under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax
returns for the years 2015, 2017 and 2018. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign
jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, no taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which the Company is not
adequately reserved.
 
It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing
federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax
authorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances
including progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the
range by which these potential events could impact 3M’s unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.  
 
The Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:

The total amount of UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $655 million as of December 31, 2018, $526 million as of December 31,
2017, and $333 million as of December 31, 2016. The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties,
and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated
statement of income on a gross basis approximately $12 million of expense, $20 million of expense, and $10 million of expense in 2018, 2017, and 2016,
respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At
December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $69 million and $68
million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is
highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.

Table of Contents
 
As a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, 
 
income from certain manufacturing activities in the following
countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: Thailand (2018), China (2019), Korea (2019),
Switzerland (2023), Singapore (2025), and Brazil (2028). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $227
million (38 cents per diluted share) in 2018, $228 million (37 cents per diluted share) in 2017, and $142 million (23 cents per diluted share) in 2016.
 
The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $12 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018,
which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large
portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested
indefinitely.

As a result of put provisions associated with certain debt instruments, long-term debt payments due in 2019 include floating rate notes totaling $53 million
(classified as current portion of long-term debt) and $71 million (included in other borrowings in the long-term debt table). Long-term debt payments due in
2020 include floating rate notes totaling $95 million (included within long term debt).
 
Credit Facilities
 
In March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year
revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion
(at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75
billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This
is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on
all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
 
Other Credit Facilities
 
Apart from the committed revolving facility, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and
outstanding at December 31, 2018. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.
 
Long-Term Debt Issuances
 
The principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table found at the
beginning of this note.

Table of Contents
 
In September 2018, 3M issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of 3.00%,
$300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2024 with a coupon rate of 3.25%, $300 million aggregate principal
amount of 5.5-year floating rate medium-term notes due 2024 with a rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index, $600 million aggregate principal
amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2028 with a coupon rate of 3.625%, and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed
rate medium-term notes due 2048 with a coupon rate of 4.00%. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on $200
million aggregate principal amount of the 3-year fixed rate medium-term notes issued with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index.
 
In October 2017, 3M issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 2.25%,
$850 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2027 with a coupon rate of 2.875%, and $500 million aggregate
principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%.
 
In May 2016, 3M issued 1 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. In September 2016, 3M issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal
amount of medium-term notes.
 
Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments
 
In November and August 2018, respectively, 3M repaid 500 million Euros and $450 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate medium-term notes
that matured.
In October 2017, 3M, via cash tender offers, repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $110 million of
its $330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its $750 million principal amount of 5.70% notes due 2037. The Company
recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of approximately $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest expense, the cash outflow for which
is recorded within other financing activities on the statement of cash flows. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount
paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses.
 
In June 2017, 3M repaid $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes that matured.
 
In September 2016, 3M repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes.
 
Floating Rate Notes
 
At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging
from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004, 3M issued a forty-year $60 million
floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at
100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and
2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices
ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the
aforementioned floating rate notes.
 
NOTE 13.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
 
 
3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In total, 3M has
over 70 defined benefit plans in 26 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participant’s years of service,
compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1,
2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while
employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by
government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is
combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.

The Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained
to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S.
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an
independent trustee.
 
The Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular
U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in
cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match
of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of
3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections.
Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $173 million, $159 million and $139 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 3M
subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution
plans were $99 million, $88 million and $87 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, 
Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost
 ,
effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. This ASU changed how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement
benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. Under the new standard, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit
cost is included in operating expenses and only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization into assets such as inventory. All other net periodic
benefit costs components (such as interest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) are reported
outside of operating income. See Note 1 for additional details.
 
The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a
summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain
non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by
particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. The
obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $40 million as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The pension accumulated benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of the
measurement date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans was
$15.033 billion and $16.270 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation of the international pension plans
was $6.438 billion and $6.870 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
The following amounts relate to pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31:

The Company provides eligible retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-based plan. The contributions
provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5
percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.
 
The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement
benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated
liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt
instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company
determined a discount rate of 4.36% for the U.S. pension plans and 4.41% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2018, which is an
increase of 0.68 percentage points and 0.62 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2017. An increase in the discount rate
lowers the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the significant increase in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018 resulted in an approximately $1.2
billion lower PBO for the U.S. pension plans. For the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which
the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the
expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond
information. In countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate
corporate bond yields. 
 
The Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs
are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-
specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit
obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
 
For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.25% in 2018. Projected returns are
based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s 2019 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.00%. The expected return assumption is based on
the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The
2018 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 23% global equities, 14% private equities, 47% fixed-income
securities, and 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment
management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2018 was -0.5%. In 2017 the plan earned a rate of return of 12.4% and in 2016 earned a return of
5.8%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 8.6% and

using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.
 
The Company converted to the “RP 2014 Mortality Tables” and updated the mortality improvement scales annually to the Society of Actuaries Scale MP-
2016, Scale MP-2017 and Scale MP-2018. The December 31, 2018 update resulted in a small decrease to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations.
 
During 2018, the Company contributed $366 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $4 million to its postretirement plans. During 2017, the
Company contributed $964 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. In 2019, the Company expects to
contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its U.S. and international retirement plans. The Company does not have a
required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and
other factors.

Plan Asset Management
 
3M’s investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. The primary goal of the trust funds is to
meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without
subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible
within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The
investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S.
pension liabilities.
 
Normally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to
external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not
considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
 
The discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 15 for descriptions of these
levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies
or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
 
In order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target
strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some
investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have
been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will
normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary
of the plans. Approximately 50% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the
primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.
 
The fair values of the assets held by the U.S. pension plans by asset class are as follows:

* In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a
practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund,
minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value
amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.

Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
 
Fixed income includes derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and futures contracts. Corporate debt includes bonds and
notes, asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and private placements. Swaps and derivative instruments are valued by the custodian
using closing market swap curves and market derived inputs. U.S. government and government agency bonds and notes are valued at the closing price
reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Corporate bonds and notes, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted
cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be
observable such as credit and liquidity risks. 
 
Private placements are valued by the custodian using recognized pricing services and sources. 
 
The private equity portfolio is a diversified mix of derivative instruments, growth equity and partnership interests. Derivative investments are written
options that are valued by independent parties using market inputs and valuation models. Growth equity investments are valued at the closing price reported
in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. 
 
Absolute return consists primarily of partnership interests in hedge funds, hedge fund of funds or other private fund vehicles. Corporate debt instruments are

International Pension Plans Assets
 
Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. The disclosure below of asset categories is presented in
aggregate for over 65 defined benefit plans in 25 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country. Local
regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The
Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger plans.
 
Each plan has its own strategic asset allocation. The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary.
 
The fair values of the assets held by the international pension plans by asset class are as follows:

*In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient
have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then
divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this
table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.

Table of Contents
 
 
Equities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the
closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
 
Fixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate, (including mortgage backed and other debt) securities. Governments,
corporate bonds and notes and mortgage backed securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently
available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs,
such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.
 
Private equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts).
REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.
 
Absolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and other
alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive
if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps that are used to help manage risks.
 
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities
purchased and interest payable.
 
The balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans’ level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute
return asset class. The aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains decreased this balance by $11million in 2018 and increased this balance by $48
million in 2017. Foreign currency exchange impacts decreased this balance by $13 million and increased this balance by $16 million in 2017.
 
NOTE 14.  Derivatives
 
 
The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial
instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M’s
financial position and performance.
 
Additional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:
·
Impact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 8.
·
Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 15.
·
Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt are also described in Note 12.
 
Types of Derivatives/Hedging Instruments and Inclusion in Income/Other Comprehensive Income:
 
Cash Flow Hedges:
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains
and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in
current earnings.
 
Cash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts:
 The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge
against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The
settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during
which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted
transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for dedesignated
hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in
99
 
Table of Contents
 
the value of derivative instruments after dedesignation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36
months.
 
Cash Flow Hedging — Interest Rate Contracts:
 
The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows
from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances. The amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables
below as part of the gain/(loss) recognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated other
comprehensive income.
 
 
In the first six months of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that expired in December 2016 with an aggregate notional
amount of $300 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Upon issuance of medium-term
notes in September 2016, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within accumulated other comprehensive
income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $200 million as a hedge against
interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. In 2017, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate
swaps with notional amounts of $600 million as hedges against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Prior to the
issuance of medium-term notes in October 2017, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within
accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.
 
During 2018, the 
Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1.2 billion as hedges
against interest rate volatility associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt. Concurrent with the issuance of the medium-term notes in September
2018, 3M terminated $500 million of these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial gain within accumulated other comprehensive
income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of $64 million associated with the after tax net unrealized gain associated with cash flow hedging
instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $7 million (after tax loss) related to forward
starting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, 3M expects to
reclassify approximately $55 million and $15 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to earnings in 2019 and
2020, respectively, and approximately $6 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging losses to earnings after 2020 (with the
impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).
 
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table. Reclassifications of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income into
income include accumulated gains (losses) on dedesignated hedges at the time earnings are impacted by the forecasted transaction.

Fair Value Hedges:
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
 
Fair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps:
 The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing
costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value
hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest
expense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
 
In November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating
interest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond obligation.
 
In June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note that is due in 2019 included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR
index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.
 
In August 2015, 3M issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into two interest rate
swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $450 million three-year fixed rate note
that matured in August 2018, and the second converted $300 million of a five-year fixed rate note that is due in 2020 included in this issuance to an interest
rate based on a floating three-month LIBOR index.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200 million that converted the company’s fixed-
rate medium-term note due 2020 into a floating-rate note as a hedge of its exposure to changes in the fair value that is attributable to interest rate risk.
 
In September 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200 million that converted a portion of the Company’s $400
million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 into a floating rate note with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR
index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk.

Net Investment Hedges:
 
The Company may use non-derivative (foreign currency denominated debt) and derivative (foreign exchange forward contracts) instruments to hedge
portions of the Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign exchange risk. For instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges
of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates
are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in
earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially
complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is
dedesignated from a net investment hedge relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes
are recorded in earnings through their maturity date.
 
3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by time period
depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or are newly issued and
designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company’s desired foreign exchange risk coverage.
 
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company dedesignated 300 million Euros of foreign currency denominated debt from a former net investment hedge
relationship.
 
At December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was approximately 150 million
Euros and approximately 248 billion South Korean Won, along with a principal amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges
totaling 4.1 billion Euros. The maturity dates of these derivative and nonderivative instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 2019 to
2031.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include dedesignated foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were designated in
cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the Cash Flow Hedges section above). In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts to
offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements) and enters into commodity
price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain commodities and precious metals. These derivative instruments are not
designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings. The Company does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Credit Risk and Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities of Derivative Instruments:
 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and
forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to
credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M
enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement
may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions.
As of December 31, 2018, 3M has International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 17 applicable banks and financial institutions
which contain netting provisions. In addition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty’s parent guarantee, 3M also has
associated credit support agreements in place with 16 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the circumstances under
which either party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified thresholds or
if a counterparty’s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these
counterparties.
 
3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when
derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide
information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in
the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the
Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the
transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation. As of the applicable dates presented below, no cash
collateral had been received or pledged related to these derivative instruments.

Foreign Currency Effects
 
3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by approximately $92 million
and approximately $152 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments
designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.
 
NOTE 15.  Fair Value Measurements
 
 
3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in
measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs
be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained
from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants
would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three
levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted
prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:
 
For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities and certain
derivative instruments. Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and net investment hedges. The information in the following paragraphs
and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with
respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company’s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2018
and 2017.
 
3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
 
Available-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities:
 
106
 
Table of Contents
 
Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities.
Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and
other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M
classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2.
Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 11.
 
Available-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only:
 
3M holds municipal securities with certain cities in the United States as of December 31, 2018. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method
utilized includes referencing the carrying value of the corresponding capital lease obligation as adjusted for additional issuances when 3M sells its assets to
the municipality and decreases in the form of bond amortization payments, and as such will be classified as level 3 securities separately. Refer to Note 9 for
additional discussion of the non-cash nature of these securities.
 
Derivative instruments:
 
The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are required to be recorded at fair value. The
Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps,
and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to
hedge 3M’s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked
to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.
 
3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-
currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include
foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their
basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest
rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash
flows model.
 
The following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

In addition, the plan assets of 3M’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). Refer to
Note 13.
 
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis:
 
Disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to long-lived asset impairments and adjustment
in carrying value of equity securities for which the measurement alternative of cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes is used. During
2017, the Company recognized approximately $61 million in long-lived asset impairments within its Electronics and Energy and Industrial business
segments, with the complete carrying amount of such assets written off and included in operating income results. There were no material long-lived asset
impairments for 2018 and 2016. There were no material adjustments to equity securities using the measurement alternative for 2018.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
 
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments, accounts payable,
borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
108
 
Table of Contents
 
accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these
instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in the preceding
disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes, which are derived all or in part
from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-party’s internal records. Information with respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair
values of these financial instruments follow:

The fair values reflected above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. The carrying amount of long-term
debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of fixed rate
Eurobond securities issued by the Company as hedging instruments of the Company’s net investment in its European subsidiaries. Many of 3M’s fixed-rate
bonds were trading at a premium at December 31, 2018 and 2017 due to the lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads compared to issuance levels.
 
NOTE 16.  Commitments and Contingencies
 
 
Capital and Operating Leases:
 
Rental expense under operating leases was $393 million in 2018, $343 million in 2017 and $318 million in 2016. It is 3M’s practice to secure renewal rights
for leases, thereby giving 3M the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in a leased facility. 3M has the following primary capital leases:
·
In 2003, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 34 million British Pound (GBP), or approximately $43 million at
December 31, 2018, exchange rates, for a building in the United Kingdom (with a lease term of 22 years).
·
3M sold and leased-back certain recently constructed machinery and equipment in return for municipal securities, which in aggregate, were
recorded as a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $13 million in 2018, $13 million in 2017, and $12 million in 2016, with an
average remaining lease term remaining of 15 years at December 31, 2018.
 
Minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2018, were as follows:

Unconditional Purchase Obligations:
 
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-cancelable, or
cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment (for those contracts with terms in
excess of one year) as of December 31, 2018, at $663 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows: 2019 ($244 million), 2020 ($216 million), 2021
($131 million), 2022 ($40 million), 2023 ($15 million) and after 2023 ($17 million). Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which
3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or
services) for these
109
 
Table of Contents
 
unconditional purchase obligations. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those
items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional
commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to purchases.
 
Warranties/Guarantees:
 
3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at
approximately $48 million at December 31, 2018, and $50 million at December 31, 2017. Further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as
the Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans
with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.
 
Related Party Activity:
 
3M does not have any material related party activity.
 
Legal Proceedings:
 
The Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings
worldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property,
and commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental proceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the
Company is vigorously defending all such litigation.
 
Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings
 
Many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and are otherwise
subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily
on estimates and assumptions. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, 
Contingencies
, and related guidance, and records liabilities for
legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate
of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The
Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot
be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if
the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
 
The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting
comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has
concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the Company also records receivables for the
amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not taken an
accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in
defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.
 
Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the Company may
not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals
for one or more of these matters could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows
in the period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, the Company currently believes that
the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings or future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
Company. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables
each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the Company
makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the Company could change in the future.

Table of Contents
 
 
The following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated
insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to
represent approximately 2,320 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,230 individual claimants with actions pending at December 31, 2017.
 
The vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s mask and
respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal
mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and
claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products
previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company
premises.
 
The Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects
that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims
alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than
in the past. Over the past twenty years, the Company has prevailed in fourteen of the fifteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described
below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict  in its favor in two lawsuits – one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court
in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury
in state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of
approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company has appealed. The
Company believes liability in this case is not probable and estimable. In June 2018, the Company also settled a number of coal mine dust lawsuits for an
amount that was not material to the Company.
 
The Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended
manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if
significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of
persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of
unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it
experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.
 
As previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other
manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended
complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker’s
compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. The case was inactive
from the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management conference in March 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to
bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages proceedings. At the hearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. No liability
has been recorded for this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not
able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal
activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law
of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried.
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
 
The Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical
claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the
111
 
Table of Contents
 
nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of
asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii)
the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the “Claims Data”). As
part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims
Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The
Company uses these estimates to develop its best estimate of probable liability.
 
Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes
in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company’s accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of
defending and resolving claims, and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims,
and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.
 
As a result of the Company’s review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and as a result of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more
serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in 2018 for respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities by $141 million. In 2018, the Company made payments for legal fees and settlements of $76 million related to the respirator
mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $673
million, up $65 million from the accrual at December 31, 2017. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of probable loss and reflects an
estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper
end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting
the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert
claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability
may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in
estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $4 million. The
Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company
will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.
 
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies
 
On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”). Aearo
manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection
products.
 
As of December 31, 2018, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business (American Optical Corporation,
Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in
numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for
alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by
other defendants or generally in the workplace.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $28 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to
current and future Aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of Aearo’s probable loss and
reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against Aearo approaching the year 2050. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for
settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner
Lambert and their respective insurers (the “Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold
respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure
of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11,
1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and
indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or
112
 
Table of Contents
 
silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of
commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to
asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to
have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to
pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with
Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.
 
Developments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in
the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these
claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure
applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor
Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which
Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of
Aearo’s share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these
liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.
 
Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future
claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities, the Company
cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.
 
Environmental Matters and Litigation
 
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic
substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private
parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for
restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will
continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and
modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with
environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for
its operations worldwide.
 
Under certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA) and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of
environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The Company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in
the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the section entitled “
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” 
that
follows for information on the amount of the accrual.
 
Environmental Matters
 
As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including
perfluorooctanoate (“PFOA”), perfluorooctane sulfonate (“PFOS”), perfluorohexane sulfonate (“PFHxS”), or other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(collectively “PFAS”). As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA,
PFOS, PFHxS, and their pre-cursor compounds. The company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately
two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. The Company
continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to perfluorobutane
sulfonate (PFBS). These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and
fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification
processes associated with the Company’s policies covering the use of all
113
 
Table of Contents
 
persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials or as
byproducts in some of 3M’s current fluorochemical manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.
 
Regulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These
activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As the database of studies of both
PFOA and PFOS has expanded, the EPA has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. In
February 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in
August 2014. In May 2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 70 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the
provisional levels established by the EPA in 2009 of 400 ppt for PFOA and 200 ppt for PFOS). Where PFOA and PFOS are found together, EPA
recommends that the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health advisory for PFOA and PFOS combined is also 70 ppt. Lifetime health
advisories, which are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse
health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. To collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA
published on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six PFAS, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water
system suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence. Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide.
Based on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and 46 exceed the level for PFOS (unchanged from the July
2016 EPA summary). A technical advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 65 public water
supplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on one or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and
do not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public
water supplies. EPA has announced a forthcoming management plan.
 
The Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste
associated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois plants. As previously reported, the
Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to address the
presence of PFAS in the soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to a permit issued by ADEM, for approximately
twenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing PFAS in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the
available options to address the presence of PFAS in the soil, ADEM agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former
sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that plan continues,
and construction of the cap was substantially completed in 2018.
 
The Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007
Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington
County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the
Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or
alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (“HBV”) or Health Risk Limit (“HRL”) (i.e., the amount of a
chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS
for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS at these sites that are
not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During
2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and
Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility.
During the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M
commenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved
by the MPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. Remediation
will continue at the Cottage Grove site during 2019.
 
In August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova,
Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results.

In May 2017, the MDH issued new HBVs for PFOS and PFOA. The new HBVs are 35 ppt for PFOA and 27 ppt for PFOS. In connection with its
announcement the MDH stated that “Drinking water with PFOA and PFOS, even at the levels above the updated values, does not represent an immediate
health risk. These values are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most
vulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.” In December 2017, the MDH issued a new HBV for
perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) of 2 ppb. In February 2018, the MDH published reports finding no unusual rates of certain cancers or adverse birth
outcomes (low birth rates or premature births) among residents of Washington and Dakota counties in Minnesota.
 
The EPA announced a four-step action plan in May 2018 regarding PFAS, which includes evaluating the need to set Safe Drinking Water Act maximum
contaminant levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS and beginning the steps necessary to designate PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under
CERCLA. In November 2018, EPA asked for public comment on draft toxicity assessments for two PFAS compounds, including PFBS.
 
The U.S.
 
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) within the Department of Health and Human Services released a draft Toxicological
Profile for PFAS for public review and comment in June 2018. In the draft report, ATSDR proposed draft Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) for PFOS, PFOA
and several other PFAS. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of
adverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are  not intended to define cleanup or action levels for ATSDR or other
agencies. In August 2018, 3M submitted comments on the ATSDR proposal, noting that there are major shortcomings with the current draft, especially with
the MRLs, and that the ATSDR’s profile must reflect the best science and full weight of evidence known about these chemicals.
 
In several states, the state legislature or the state environmental agency have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards,
groundwater values or drinking water values for PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS.
 
The Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such
compounds or the consequences of any such actions.
 
Litigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama
 
As previously reported, a former employee filed a putative class action lawsuit in 2002 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama (the “St. John
case”), seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and property damage from exposure to
certain perfluorochemicals at or near the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The court in 2005 granted the Company’s motion to dismiss
the named plaintiff’s personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the state’s Workers
Compensation Act. The plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended complaint in November 2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a
putative class of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the Decatur plant. In June 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding
additional defendants, including BFI Waste Management Systems of Alabama, LLC; BFI Waste Management of North America, LLC; the City of Decatur,
Alabama; Morgan County, Alabama; Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur; and Morgan County, Alabama, d/b/a Decatur Utilities.
 
In 2005, the judge –  in a second putative class action lawsuit filed by three residents of Morgan County, Alabama, seeking unstated compensatory and
punitive damages involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of certain perfluorochemical compounds from the Company’s Decatur,
Alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured those compounds (the “Chandler case”) –  granted the Company’s motion to abate the case,
effectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the St. John case. Despite the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage on behalf of the named plaintiffs and the members of a putative class. No
further action in the case is expected unless and until the stay is lifted.
 
In February 2009, a resident of Franklin County, Alabama, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Franklin County (the “Stover case”)
seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the Decatur utility’s wastewater treatment plant of wastewater treatment
sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that allegedly contain PFOA, PFOS and other perfluorochemicals. The named plaintiff seeks to represent a
class of all persons within the State of Alabama who have had PFOA, PFOS, and other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on their property. In
March 2010, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the
115
 
Table of Contents
 
case transferred from Franklin County to Morgan County. In May 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the Morgan County Circuit Court
abated this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the St. John case.
 
In October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (Water Authority) filed an individual complaint against 3M Company, Dyneon,
L.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint also includes representative plaintiffs who
brought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property who use water provided by the Water Authority and five
local water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the “Water Utilities”). The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive
damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’ chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in
Decatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River at the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment
processes utilized by the Water Authority. In September 2016, the court granted 3M’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ trespass claims with prejudice,
negligence claims for personal injuries, and private nuisance claims, and denied the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ negligence claims for property damage,
public nuisance, abatement of nuisance, battery and wantonness.
 
In June 2016, the Tennessee Riverkeeper, Inc. (Riverkeeper), a non-profit corporation, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama against 3M; BFI Waste Systems of Alabama; the City of Decatur, Alabama; and the Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur, Morgan County,
Alabama. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in connection with the disposal of certain PFAS
through their ownership and operation of their respective sites. The complaint further alleges such practices may present an imminent and substantial
endangerment to health and/or the environment and that Riverkeeper has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm caused by defendants’ failure
to abate the endangerment unless the court grants the requested relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief.
 
In August 2016, a group of over 200 plaintiffs filed a putative class action against West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water
Authority), 3M, Dyneon, Daikin, BFI, and the City of Decatur in state court in Lawrence County, Alabama. Plaintiffs are residents of Lawrence, Morgan
and other counties who are or have been customers of the Water Authority. They contend defendants have released PFAS that contaminate the Tennessee
River and, in turn, their drinking water, causing damage to their health and properties. In January 2017, the court in the St. John case, discussed above,
stayed this litigation pending resolution of the St. John case.
 
In January 2017, several hundred plaintiffs sued 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, and Daikin America in Lawrence and Morgan Counties, Alabama. The
plaintiffs are owners of property, residents, and holders of property interests who receive their water from the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and
Sewer Authority (Water Authority). They assert common law claims for negligence, nuisance, trespass, wantonness, and battery, and they seek injunctive
relief and punitive damages. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur that have released
and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharge into the Tennessee
River. The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants have discharged into Bakers Creek and the Decatur Utilities Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant,
which, in turn, discharges wastewater containing these chemicals into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges,
the water supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to
humans.
 
In November 2017, a putative class action (the “King” case) was filed against 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, Daikin America, and the West Morgan-East
Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water Authority) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs are residents of
Lawrence and Morgan County, Alabama who receive their water from the Water Authority. They assert various common law claims, including negligence,
nuisance, wantonness, and fraudulent concealment, and they seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, compensatory and punitive damages for their alleged
personal injuries. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur that have released and
continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharge into the Tennessee
River. The plaintiffs also contend that the defendants have discharged chemicals into the Decatur Utilities Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, which, in
turn, discharged wastewater containing these chemicals into the Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges, the water
supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans.
 
In January 2018, certain property owners in Trinity, Alabama filed a lawsuit against 3M, Dyneon, and three unnamed defendants in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs assert claims for negligence, strict liability, trespass,
116
 
Table of Contents
 
nuisance, wanton and reckless conduct, and citizen suit claims for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. They allege these claims arise
from the defendants’ contamination of their property by disposal of PFAS in a landfill located on their property. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and
punitive damages and a court order directing the defendants to remediate all PFAS contamination on their property. In September 2018, the case was
dismissed by stipulation of the parties.
 
In September 2018, an individual plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama raising allegations and claims
substantially similar to those asserted by plaintiffs in the King case.
 
Litigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Minnesota
 
In July 2016, the City of Lake Elmo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against 3M alleging that the City suffered
damages from drinking water supplies contaminated with PFAS, including costs to construct alternative sources of drinking water. The parties mediated in
August 2018 and again in December 2018. Although the parties did not reach a resolution, discussions continue. Trial is scheduled to begin in September
2019.
 
State Attorneys General Litigation related to PFAS
 
In December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M to recover damages
(including unspecified assessment costs and reasonable attorney’s fees) for alleged injury to, destruction of, and loss of use of certain of the State’s natural
resources under the Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act (MERLA) and the Minnesota Water Pollution Control Act (MWPCA), as well as
statutory nuisance and common law claims of trespass, nuisance, and negligence with respect to the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water,
fish or other aquatic life, and sediments (the “NRD Lawsuit”). The State also sought declarations under MERLA that 3M is responsible for all damages the
State may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of PFAS into the environment, and that 3M is responsible for compensation for
future loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life, and other damages under the MWPCA. In September 2017, the State’s damages expert submitted a report
that contended the State incurred $5 billion in damages. In November 2017, the State of Minnesota filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint to seek
punitive damages from 3M, and 3M filed a motion for summary judgment contending, among other things, that the State’s claims were barred by the
applicable statute of limitations. In December 2017, the court urged the parties to attempt to resolve the litigation before trial, and in January 2018, the court
appointed a mediator to facilitate that process. In February 2018, 3M and the State of Minnesota reached a resolution of the NRD Lawsuit. Under the terms
of the settlement, 3M agreed to provide an $850 million grant to the State for a special “3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.” This Fund will enable
projects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to residents and enhancing groundwater
recharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space
preservation. 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 associated with
the resolution of this matter.
 
In June 2018, the State of New York, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in Albany Country Supreme Court against 3M, Tyco Fire Products LP,
Chemguard, Inc., Buckeye Fire Equipment Co., National Foam, Inc., and Kidde-Fenwal, Inc., seeking to recover the costs incurred in responding to the
contamination caused by Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) manufactured by 3M and others; damages for injury to, destruction of, and loss of the
State’s natural resources and related recreational series; and property damage.
 
In July 2018, the now former governor of Michigan requested that the now former Michigan Attorney General file a lawsuit against 3M and others related
to PFAS in a public letter. The new Michigan Attorney General has not yet announced whether she will do so.
 
In December 2018, the State of Ohio, through its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in the Common Pleas Court of Lucas County, Ohio against 3M, Tyco
Fire Products LP, Chemguard, Inc., Buckeye Fire Equipment Co., National Foam, Inc., and Angus Fire Armour Corp., seeking injunctive relief and
compensatory and punitive damages for remediation costs and alleged injury to Ohio natural resources from AFFF manufacturers.
 
Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Environmental Litigation
 
3M manufactured and marketed AFFF for use in firefighting at airports and military bases from approximately 1963 to 2000. As of December 31, 2018, 85
putative class action and other lawsuits have been filed against 3M and other defendants in various state and federal courts in Arizona, Colorado, Delaware,
Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington
117

where current or former airports, military bases, or fire training facilities are or were located. In these cases, plaintiffs typically allege that certain PFAS
used in AFFF contaminated the soil and groundwater where AFFF was used and seek damages for loss of use and enjoyment of properties, diminished
property values, investigation costs, remediation costs, and in some cases, personal injury and funds for medical monitoring. Several companies have been
sued along with 3M, including Ansul Co. (acquired by Tyco, Inc.), Angus Fire, Buckeye Fire Protection Co., Chemguard, National Foam, Inc., and United
Technologies Corp.
 
In December 2018, th
e U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted motions to transfer and consolidate all AFFF cases pending in federal courts
to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina to be managed in a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings.
As of December 31, 2018, there were 85 cases in the MDL.
 
Other PFAS-related Environmental Litigation
 
3M manufactured and sold products containing various perfluorooctanyl compounds (PFOA and PFOS), including Scotchgard, for several decades.
Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things,
that 3M’s customers’ improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases
generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated
groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation
costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell
International Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., and various carpet manufacturers.
 
In New York, 3M is defending 22 individual cases and one putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York
against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (“Saint-Gobain”), Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and
Company. Plaintiffs allege that 3M manufactured and sold PFOA that was used for manufacturing purposes at Saint-Gobain’s and Honeywell’s facilities
located in the Village of Hoosick Falls and the Town of Hoosick. Plaintiffs claim that the drinking water around Hoosick Falls became contaminated with
unsafe levels of PFOA due to the activities of the defendants and allege that they suffered bodily injury due to the ingestion and inhalation of PFOA.
Plaintiffs seek unstated compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
In Michigan, two putative class actions are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine World Wide
(Wolverine) and other defendants. The complaints include some or all of the following claims: negligence, trespass, intentional and negligent infliction of
emotional distress, battery, products liability, public and private nuisance, fraudulent concealment, and unjust enrichment. The actions arise from
Wolverine’s allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes related to their shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M
Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M’s product have contaminated the environment after being disposed of near drinking
water sources. In addition to the two federal court class actions, as of December 31, 2018, 3M has been named as defendant in 214 private individual
actions in Michigan state court based on similar allegations. Wolverine also filed a third-party complaint against 3M in a suit by the State of Michigan
against Wolverine seeking to compel Wolverine to investigate and address contamination associated with its historic disposal activity.
 
In Alabama, 3M is defending two lawsuits filed in state court by local public water suppliers relating to 3M’s sale of PFAS-containing products to carpet
manufacturers in Georgia. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFOA and PFOS into the surface water
and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River.
 
In Delaware, 3M is defending one putative class action filed in federal court relating to alleged contamination allegedly caused by waste from Wolverine
World Wide, which used Scotchgard in its manufacture of leather products. 3M allegedly supplied Scotchgard to Wolverine.
 
In Maine, 3M is defending one individual action in federal court relating to contamination of drinking water and dairy farm operations by PFAS from
wastewater sludge. Plaintiffs contend that PFAS entered the wastewater via discharge from another company’s facility in Kennebunk, Maine.

In New Jersey, 3M is defending one putative class action in federal court that relates to the DuPont “Chambers Works” plant. Plaintiffs allege that PFAS
compounds from the plant have contaminated private wells for drinking water.
 
In October 2018, 3M and other defendants, including DuPont and Chemours, were named in a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio. The named plaintiff, a firefighter allegedly exposed to PFAS chemicals through his use of firefighting foam, purports to represent
a class of “all individuals residing within the United States who, at the time a class is certified in this case, have detectable levels of PFAS materials in their
blood serum.” The plaintiff brings claims for negligence, battery, and conspiracy, but does not seek damages for personal injury, medical monitoring, or
property damage. Instead, the plaintiff seeks an order finding the defendants “are liable and responsible for the PFAS in Plaintiff’s and the class members’
blood and/or bodies” and an order “establishing an independent panel of scientists” to be “tasked with independently studying, evaluating, reviewing,
identifying, publishing, and notifying/informing the Class” of research results.
 
Other Environmental Litigation
 
In July 2018, the Company, along with more than 120 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the
cleaning up of approximately eight miles of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey. The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to
design and pay the estimated $165 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing eight chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The
complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company. The Company’s involvement in the case relates to its past use of two
commercial drum conditioning facilities in New Jersey. Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the
case remains to be determined.
 
For environmental litigation matters described above, no liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those matters is not probable and
estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time.
 
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had recorded liabilities of $25 million for estimated “environmental remediation” costs based upon an evaluation
of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $8 million. The Company records
liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of
feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are
based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other
potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as
further information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the
applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had recorded liabilities of $59 million for “other environmental liabilities” based upon an evaluation of currently
available facts to implement the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with the MPCA (including the best estimate of the probable liability under the
settlement of the NRD Lawsuit for interim treatment of municipal and private wells), the remedial action agreement with ADEM, as well as presence in the
soil and groundwater at the Company’s manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama, and Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in
Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). The Company expects that most of the spending will occur over the next four years.
 
It is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of
applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments
may occur that could affect the Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the
environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific
compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and
evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of
other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental
liabilities,” at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including
required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss
119
 
Table of Contents
 
in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at
which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals
for the reasons described above.
 
Other Matters
 
Department of Labor Investigation
 
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) notified 3M in April 2015 that it had commenced an investigation of 3M’s pension plan pursuant to the federal
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). The DOL has stated its investigation relates to certain private equity
investments, plan expenses, securities lending, and distributions of plan benefits. In response to certain DOL requests, 3M produced documents and made
employees available for interviews. In December 2016, the DOL issued certain subpoenas to 3M and 3M Investment Management Corp. relating to this
investigation. 3M has produced additional responsive documents and is cooperating with the DOL in its investigation. In June 2018, the DOL issued a
letter indicating that it did not intend to take further action.
 
Product Liability Litigation
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company is a named defendant in lawsuits involving approximately 5,015 plaintiffs (compared to approximately 4,270
plaintiffs at December 31, 2017) who allege the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system caused a surgical site infection. Nearly all of the lawsuits are
pending in federal court in Minnesota. The plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later
developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system (the Bair Hugger™ product line was acquired by 3M as part
of the 2010 acquisition of Arizant, Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body
temperature in surgical settings). The complaints seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and
implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and
violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts. One case, from the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Tennessee is a putative nationwide class action. The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) granted the plaintiffs’ motion
to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district
proceeding during the pre-trial phase of the litigation. In 2017, the U.S. District Court and the Minnesota state courts denied the plaintiffs’ motions to
amend their complaints to add claims for punitive damages. At a joint hearing before the U.S. District Court and the Minnesota State court, on the parties’
motion to exclude each other’s experts, and 3M’s motion for summary judgment with respect to general causation, the federal court did not exclude the
plaintiffs’ experts and denied 3M’s motion for summary judgment on general causation. In January 2018, the state court, in hearing the same arguments,
excluded plaintiffs’ experts and granted 3M’s motion for summary judgment on general causation, dismissing all 61 cases pending before the state court in
Minnesota. Plaintiffs appealed that ruling and the state court’s punitive damages ruling. In January 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the
Minnesota state court orders in their entirety. The plaintiffs have indicated that they intend to seek review by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
 
In April 2018, the federal court partially granted 3M’s motion for summary judgment in the first bellwether case, leaving for trial a claim for strict liability
based upon design defect. The court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims for negligence, failure to warn, and common law and statutory fraud. In the trial of the
first bellwether case in May 2018, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in 3M’s favor finding that the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system was not
defective and was not the cause of the plaintiff’s injury.  The plaintiff appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The plaintiffs
dismissed the two bellwether cases set for trial in December 2018. Of the other six bellwether cases designated for trial, the plaintiffs have so far dismissed
four and agreed to dismiss the fifth, leaving only one. The second bellwether trial is set for May 2019.
 
3M is also defending two other state court actions. One case is pending in Hidalgo County, Texas and combines Bair Hugger product liability claims with
medical malpractice claims. The other state court case is pending in Ramsey County, Minnesota, and was filed after the Minnesota state court’s summary
judgment ruling.
 
An additional state court case was filed in late 2018 in Jackson County, Missouri, combining Bair Hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice
claims against Missouri defendants. 3M removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. 3M contemporaneously filed a
motion to stay any proceedings in this case pending transfer of the case to the MDL.

In June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents who underwent
various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient
warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the
MDL. No liability has been recorded for the Bair Hugger™ litigation because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at
this time.
 
In September 2011, 3M Oral Care launched Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM dental restorative material. The product was originally indicated for inlay, onlay,
veneer, and crown applications. In June 2015, 3M Oral Care voluntarily removed crown applications from the product’s instructions for use, following
reports from dentists of patients’ crowns debonding, requiring additional treatment. The product remains on the market for other applications. 3M
communicated with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as regulators outside the United States. 3M also informed customers and distributors of
its action, offered to accept return of unused materials and provide refunds. In May 2018, 3M reached a preliminary settlement for an amount that did not
have a material impact to the Company of the lawsuit pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota that sought certification of a class of
dentists in the United States and its territories. The settlement is subject to the court’s approval and certification of the settlement class, with a right of class
members to opt-out of the settlement and bring individual claims against the Company.
 
In December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained
personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3M’s Dual-Ended Combat Arms earplugs – Version 2, a product no longer sold by the Company or
its subsidiary Aearo Technologies. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks
various damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages. In 2019, approximately 26 other lawsuits have been filed
against 3M by former or current military personnel in various state and federal courts in California, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas,
Florida, and the District of Columbia making similar allegations.
 
For product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company believes the amount recorded is not
material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range
of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.
 
 
NOTE 17.  Stock-Based Compensation
 
 
The 3M 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 123,965,000 shares of 3M common stock pursuant to awards granted
under the plan. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, progressive stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining
shares available for grant under the LTIP Program are 26.3 million and there were approximately 7,700 participants with outstanding options, restricted
stock, or restricted stock units.
 
The Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of
individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on
the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense
recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed ten years of service.
This retiree-eligible population represents 38 percent of the annual stock-based compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based
compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter.
 
In addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. The Company
issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and
are considered immaterial by the Company.
 
Beginning in 2016, as a result of the Company’s application of ASU No. 2016-09, 
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
, certain
excess tax benefits at the time of exercise (for an option) or upon vesting (for restricted stock units) are recognized as income tax benefits in the statement
of income. These amounts totaled $100 million, $228 million, and $184 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are reflected in the “income tax
benefits” line within the stock-based compensation table below.

Stock options vest over a period from one to three years with the expiration date at 10 years from date of grant. As of December 31, 2018, there was $66
million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested stock option based awards. This expense is expected to be recognized
over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 20 months. For options outstanding at December 31, 2018, the weighted-average remaining
contractual life was 66 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.918 billion. For options exercisable at December 31, 2018, the weighted-average
remaining contractual life was 55 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.791 billion.
 
The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $469 million, $703 million and $608 million, respectively. Cash
received from options exercised during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $316 million, $585 million and $665 million, respectively. The Company’s actual tax
benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $99 million, $238 million and $224
million, respectively.
 
For the primary annual stock option grant, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
and the assumptions that follow.

Expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period. For the 2018 annual grant date, the
Company estimated the expected volatility based upon the following three volatilities of 3M stock: the median of the term of the expected life rolling
volatility; the median of the most recent term of the expected life volatility; and the implied volatility on the grant date. The expected term assumption is
based on the weighted average of historical grants.

As of December 31, 2018, there was $74 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted
stock units. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 21 months. The total fair value of restricted
stock and restricted stock units that vested during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $155 million, $136 million and $149 million, respectively. The Company’s
actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $29
million, $45 million and $56 million, respectively.
 
Restricted stock units granted generally vest three years following the grant date assuming continued employment. Dividend equivalents equal to the
dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3M common stock accrue on these restricted stock units during the vesting period, although no
dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date. Dividends are paid out in cash at the vest date
on restricted stock units. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average
restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
 
Performance Shares
 
Instead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The 2018 performance
criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and earnings per share growth) were
selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that
could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from 0% to 200% of each performance share granted,
depending on the performance of the

Company during such performance period. When granted, these performance shares are awarded at 100% of the estimated number of shares at the end of
the three-year performance period and are reflected under “Granted” in the table below. Non-substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance
shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each individual became a 3M executive. The performance share grants accrue dividends,
therefore the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on
basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in computation of diluted
earnings per share.

As of December 31, 2018, there was $18 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to performance shares. This expense is
expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average earnings period of 10 months. The total fair value of performance shares that were
distributed were $48 million, $55 million, and $54 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax
deductions related to the distribution of performance shares was $11 million per year for 2018 and $15 million per year for both 2017 and 2016.
 
General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP):
 
As of December 31, 2018, shareholders have approved 60 million shares for issuance under the Company’s GESPP. Substantially all employees are eligible
to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the
beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.
 
The weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $31.91, $30.07 and $24.72, respectively. The fair value of GESPP
options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESSP options of $30 million in 2018, $26
million in 2017 and $24 million in 2016.
 
 
 
NOTE 18.  Business Segments
 
3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M
manages its operations in five business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. 3M’s five business
segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient
sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial
intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated
independently, would report the operating income information shown. The difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to interest
income and interest expense, which are not allocated to business segments, along with non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net
periodic benefit costs.
 
As part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes,
effective in the first quarter of 2018, and other revisions impacting business segment reporting:
124
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Consolidation of customer account activity within international countries – expanding dual credit reporting
·
The Company consolidated its customer account activity in each country into centralized sales districts for certain countries that make up
approximately 70 percent of 3M’s 2017 international net sales. Expansion of these initiatives, which previously had been deployed only in the
U.S., reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual
credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides
customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. The expansion of alignment of customer accounts within
additional countries increased the attribution of dual credit across 3M’s business segments. Additionally, certain sales and operating income
results for electronic bonding product lines that were previously equally divided between the Electronics and Energy business segment and the
Industrial business segment are now reported similarly to dual credit. As a result, previously reported aggregate business segment net sales and
operating income for total year 2017 increased $1.568 billion and $402 million, respectively, offset by similar increases in the elimination of dual
credit net sales and operating income amounts.
 
Centralization of manufacturing and supply technology platforms
·
Certain shared film manufacturing and supply technology platform resources formerly reflected within the Electronics and Energy business
segment were combined with other shared and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated. This
change resulted in a decrease in previously reported net sales and an increase in operating income for total year 2017 of $1 million and $42
million, respectively, in the Electronics and Energy segment, offset by a corresponding increase in net sales and decrease in operating income
within Corporate and Unallocated.
 
In addition, as discussed in Note 1, 3M adopted ASU N0. 2017-07, 
Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost
, effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. As a result, operating income for 3M’s business segments has been revised
to reflect non-service cost related pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs within other expense (income), net
 
The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.

Corporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative
gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain
under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments.
Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer
of all of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is
subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
 
3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates
each of its five business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth.
As a result, 3M reflects additional (“dual”) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect to the
particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division
level. For example, certain respirators are primarily sold by the Personal Safety Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment; however, a sales
district within the Industrial business segment provides the contact for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling
segment (Industrial) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income.
The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such
sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled “Elimination of Dual Credit,” such that sales and
operating income in total are unchanged.

In the first quarter of 2018, the resolution of the State of Minnesota Natural Resource Damages (NRD) lawsuit reduced net income by $710 million, or
$1.16 per diluted share. Refer to Note 16 for additional details. Additionally, the first quarter of 2018 was impacted by a measurement period adjustment
related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which reduced net income by $217 million, or $0.36 per diluted share. Refer to Note 10 for
additional details.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company’s ongoing IRS examination under the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) and new guidance released under
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a charge that reduced net income by $60 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of
2018, the Company finalized the tax impact related to TCJA with a reversal of previously recorded tax expense that increased net income by $41 million, or
$0.07 per diluted share. On a combined basis, these items, including the impacts detailed above for the first quarter of 2018, reduced net income by $946
million, or $1.57 per diluted share in 2018.
 
Fourth quarter and year 2017 were impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which reduced net income by $762 million
and reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.25 in the fourth quarter and $1.24 for year 2017. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.

Controls
 
 and Procedures.
 
a. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
 
b. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.
 
c. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
The Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain
financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a
worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.
 
The Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the
United States, and will continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,
this application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for
effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the
implementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting.

EXHIBIT 10.24
3M COMPENSATION PLAN FOR NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
ARTICLE 1
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1.
 
Objective
.
    
It is the intent of 3M Company (“3M”) to provide a compensation program that will attract and
retain highly qualified individuals to serve as nonemployee members of 3M’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).  This program will
be called the “3M Compensation Plan for Nonemployee Directors” (the “Plan”).  This amendment and restatement of the Plan is
effective January 1, 2019 (the “Effective Date”). 
1.2.
 
Components of Compensation
.  Each nonemployee member of the Board (each, a “Nonemployee Director”)
will be eligible to receive a base annual retainer, one or more additional annual retainers for service as chair of one or more Board
committees, an additional annual retainer for service as the lead independent director, and other fees.  All retainers and other fees
provided to the Nonemployee Directors will be paid at such times, in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions set forth
in this Plan and as the Board may determine to be appropriate, subject to any limitations set forth from time to time in the 3M
Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan or any successor thereto (the “LTIP”).
For purposes of the Plan, the term “Annual Stock Retainer” refers to the portion of the retainers and other fees that the Board
determines will be paid only in shares of the Company’s common stock (“Shares”), deferred stock units (“DSUs”) or a combination of
Shares and DSUs and the term “Annual Cash Retainer” refers to all other retainers and fees.
1.3.
 
Conversion of Amounts to Shares/DSUs
.  Unless otherwise specified by the Board or set forth herein, the
number of Shares or DSUs to be issued, transferred or credited on any given date in respect of a cash-based amount will be
determined by dividing (a) such amount (as converted into U.S. dollars, if necessary, on such basis as may reasonably be determined
by the Company in its discretion) by (b) the closing sales price (rounded to the nearest cent) for a Share as quoted on the New York
Stock Exchange for the last trading day immediately preceding the initial payment date determined in accordance with the terms of
the Plan (i.e., without regard to any delay for administrative convenience), rounded up to the nearest thousandth of a share or DSU, as
applicable. 
1.4.
 
Vesting; Restrictions
.  Except as set forth in Section 3.5, as required by applicable law or as otherwise specified
by the Board, (i) DSUs awarded in accordance with the terms of the Plan as payment for services rendered as a Nonemployee
Director will be fully vested, and (ii) Shares issued or transferred in accordance with the terms of the Plan as payment for services
rendered as a Nonemployee Director will be fully vested and unrestricted Shares.
1.5.
 
Administration
.  The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the
Board.  The Committee has the authority to take all actions and make all determinations under the Plan, to interpret the Plan and to
adopt, amend and repeal Plan administrative rules, guidelines and practices as it deems advisable.  The Committee may correct
defects and ambiguities, supply omissions, reconcile inconsistencies in the Plan and make all other determinations that that it deems
necessary or appropriate to administer the Plan.  The Committee’s determinations under the Plan are in its sole discretion and will be
final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan or any award.
 
ARTICLE 2
 
ANNUAL CASH RETAINER
2.1.
 
General
.  This Article 2 applies to the Annual Cash Retainer.
2.2.
 
Medium of Payment
.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Annual Cash Retainer will be paid in cash
or such other medium as may be selected by the Nonemployee Director in accordance with Section 4.1.
2.3.
 
Timing of Payment
.  The Annual Cash Retainer will be paid (or credited to the Nonemployee Director’s
memorandum account) in arrears in four equal installments, on or as soon as administratively practicable following the third trading
day after the issuance of the quarterly earnings press release for the calendar quarter in which such fees were earned,
 
unless otherwise
specified by the Board.  For example, if the quarterly earnings press release for the first quarter of calendar year 2019, is issued on
April 24, 2019, the portion of the Annual Cash Retainer earned during the first quarter of calendar year 2019 generally would be
paid on or about April 29, 2019.
2.4.
 
Proration for New or Departing Directors; Special Appointments
.  
 The Annual Cash Retainer for a new or
departing Nonemployee Director will be prorated based on the number of days within the calendar quarter during which a participant
serves as a Nonemployee Director.   For avoidance of doubt, additional cash retainers or fees for service pursuant to 
a special
appointment
 (e.g., Chair of the Board or one or more Board committees, lead independent Director) constituting part of the Annual
Cash Retainer will be prorated separately based on the number of days within the calendar quarter during which a participant serves
in the role for which such fees are provided. 
ARTICLE 3
 
ANNUAL STOCK RETAINER
3.1.
 
In General
.  This Article 3 applies to the Annual Stock Retainer. 
3.2.
 
Medium of Payment
.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Annual Stock Retainer will be paid in
DSUs settled in a single lump sum in the first year following the recipient’s Separation from Service (as defined in Section 4.5(a)
below) or such other medium as may be selected by the Nonemployee Director in accordance with Section 4.1.
3.3.
 
Timing of Payment
.  The Annual Stock Retainer will be paid (or credited to the Nonemployee Director’s
memorandum account) in a single lump sum on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the annual meeting of the
Company’s stockholders (or the date of an individual’s appointment or election to serve as a Nonemployee Director, if later), or at
such other time as may be determined by the Board.
3.4.
 
Proration for New Directors
.
   
The initial Annual Stock Retainer for 
an individual whose appointment or
election to serve as a Nonemployee Director becomes effective on a date other than the date of an annual meeting of the Company’s
stockholders 
will be 
prorated by multiplying the full amount of the Annual Stock Retainer that otherwise would have been payable to
such individual (assuming that he or she had been elected to serve as a Nonemployee Director at the Annual Meeting of the
Company’s stockholders immediately preceding his or her appointment or election) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum
of (a) three hundred and sixty-five (365)
2
 
minus (b) the number of calendar days since the most recent annual meeting at which one or more members of the Board stood for
re-election and the denominator of which is three hundred and sixty-five (365).
3.5.
 
Holding Period
.  Shares acquired on or after October 1, 2007, as part of the Annual Stock Retainer shall not be
sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of on or before the date that the participant ceases to be a member of the Board.
ARTICLE 4
 
ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF PAYMENT
4.1.
 
Payment Elections
. 
(a)
 
Continuing Directors.  
Unless otherwise determined by the Board, each Nonemployee Director may
elect, by written notice signed and delivered to 3M prior to the beginning of each calendar year, to receive all or a portion of his or
her Annual Cash Retainer for the following calendar year in (a) cash, (b) Shares, (c) deferred cash pursuant to Section 4.3 (“Deferred
Cash”) or (d) DSUs pursuant to Section 4.4, and may elect to receive all or a portion of his or her Annual Stock Retainer (as defined
below) in the form of (a) Shares or (b) DSUs pursuant to Section 4.4.  A Nonemployee Director may revoke an election prior to the
beginning of the calendar year for which it applies.  A Nonemployee Director may make a separate payment election for each
calendar year. 
(b)
 
New Directors
.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, a Nonemployee Director initially elected or
appointed to the Board after the beginning of a calendar year may elect, by written notice to 3M delivered not later than 30 days after
such Nonemployee Director’s term begins, to receive payment in an alternative form made available to continuing Nonemployee
Directors in accordance with Section 4.1(a) above but only with respect to unpaid amounts earned during the portion of the calendar
year  following the date on which the election becomes effective and irrevocable (e.g., the portion of the Annual Cash Retainer
attributable to service as a Nonemployee Director after such date, as determined in a manner consistent with Section 2.4).  Unless the
terms of the payment election provide otherwise, the Nonemployee Director will have the right to revoke an election made under this
Section 4.1(b) until the end of the last day permitted for making such an election.  Such Nonemployee Director’s ability to elect
alternative forms and time of payment under this Plan for succeeding years will be on the same basis as for other Nonemployee
Directors.
4.2.
 
Duration of Payment Elections
.
(a)
 
General Rule
.  An election under Section 4.1(a) above will remain in effect for the duration 
of the
calendar year that next follows
 3M’s receipt of such election.
(b)
 
Initial Election
.  An election under Section 4.1(b) above will remain in effect for the portion 
of the
calendar year remaining after the election becomes effective and irrevocable
.
4.3.
 
Deferred Cash
.  For each Nonemployee Director who receives all or a portion of his or her Annual Cash
Retainer in the form of Deferred Cash, 3M will establish a memorandum account and will credit such memorandum account for
amounts of Deferred Cash earned. Such   
amounts will be credited as of the date(s) on which they otherwise would be paid in cash
pursuant to Section 2.3 absent a deferral election.  A separate memorandum account will be established for each calendar year.
(a)
 
Accrual of Interest
.  Interest will accrue on each memorandum account from the date on which amounts
are credited to the memorandum account through the date immediately preceding the date of any distribution.
(b)
 
Compounding
.  Interest will be compounded on the last day of each calendar quarter.
3
 
(c)
 
Notional Interest Rate
.  Interest will be calculated at a rate equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%)
of the long-term applicable federal rate, assuming compounding on a quarterly basis, in effect for the first month of the relevant
calendar quarter (determined under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code
 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder)
 or 
such
other reasonable rate of interest (determined in accordance with Section 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2)(i)(C) of the Treasury Regulations) as
may be specified by the Board.
(d)
 
Distributions
.  Distribution from the Deferred Cash memorandum account will be made in cash at the
time or times determined in accordance with Section 4.5 below.
4.4.
 
Deferred Stock Units
.  For each Nonemployee Director who receives all or a portion of his or her Annual Cash
Retainer or Annual Stock Retainer in the form of DSUs, 3M will establish a memorandum account and will credit such memorandum
account with the DSUs earned.  Each DSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock.  A separate
memorandum account will be established for each calendar year.
(a)
 
Crediting of DSUs
.  DSUs will be credited to a Nonemployee Director’s memorandum account 
as of
 the
same date that payment otherwise would be made pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 3.3, as applicable, if paid currently.
(b)
 
Number of DSUs Credited
.  The number of DSUs credited to a Nonemployee Director’s memorandum
account will be determined as follows:
(i)
 
with respect to DSUs credited to a Nonemployee Director’s memorandum account in respect of
any retainers and fees earned that otherwise would be payable in Shares, the number of DSUs credited will equal the
number of Shares that otherwise would have been issued or transferred to the Nonemployee Director.
(ii)
 
with respect to DSUs credited to a Nonemployee Director’s memorandum account in respect of
any retainers and fees earned that otherwise would be payable in cash, the number of DSUs credited will be determined in
accordance with Section 1.3.
(c)
 
Voting and Dividends
.  A Nonemployee Director will not have any right to vote or receive dividends
with respect to any Shares underlying the DSUs credited to his or her account unless and until he or she becomes the record holder of
such Shares.
(d)
 
Dividend Equivalents
.  For each ordinary cash dividend paid on the shares of the Company’s common
stock, each Nonemployee Director’s memorandum account will be credited with an additional number of DSUs on the applicable
dividend payment date for such ordinary cash dividend.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the number of additional DSUs
to be credited will be calculated in accordance with Section 1.3 based on the aggregate amount of the dividends otherwise payable on
the aggregate number of Shares underlying the DSUs credited to the Nonemployee Director’s memorandum account on the
applicable dividend record date.
(e)
 
Adjustments
.  The number of DSUs credited to each Nonemployee Director’s memorandum account will
be subject to adjustment from time to time for extraordinary dividends, stock splits, stock dividends, mergers, consolidations, etc., as
set forth in the LTIP. 
(f)
 
Distributions
. DSUs will be settled in Shares equal to the number of common stock equivalents credited
to such memorandum account at the time or times set forth in Section 4.5 below. 
4.5.
 
Timing of Payment of Deferred Cash and DSUs
(a)
 
Payment Terms
.  If timely elected by the Nonemployee Director, distribution of the Nonemployee
Director’s memorandum account(s) will be as follows:
4
 
(i)
 
a single lump sum on the first business day of January during the first or second calendar year,
as elected by the Nonemployee Director, following the calendar year in which the Nonemployee Director’s Separation from
Service occurs; or
(ii)
 
three, five, or ten annual installments, as elected by the Nonemployee Director, payable on the
first business day of January in each of the first three, five, or ten years, as applicable, following the calendar year in which
the Nonemployee Director’s Separation from Service occurs;
For purposes of Section 4.5(a)(ii) above, the amount of each installment payment with respect to a memorandum account will be
determined by dividing the value of such account as of the immediately preceding December 31 by the number of installment
payments remaining to be paid. 
For purposes of this Plan, “Separation from Service” means a complete severance of a director’s relationship as a Director of 3M and
all affiliates, if any, and as an independent contractor to 3M and all affiliates, if any, for any reason.  A Nonemployee Director may
have a Separation from Service upon his or her resignation as a member of the Board even if the Nonemployee Director then becomes
an officer or other employee of 3M or an affiliate.  Separation from Service will in all respects be construed to have a meaning
consistent with the term “separation from service” as used and defined in Section 409A.

paid in the form of cash or Deferred Cash, respectively.
5.2.

powers under the Plan to one or more committees or officers of 3M or any of its subsidiaries.  Any delegation hereunder shall be

the participant’s beneficiary in full as soon as administratively practicable following the participant’s death in accordance with the
limitations of Section 409A.
5.4.
 
Unfunded Obligations
.  The amounts to be paid to Nonemployee Directors under the Plan are unfunded

assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered in any manner, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any

5.7.

Section 409A
. Payments under the Plan made as deferred cash or DSUs are intended to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A and the Plan will be interpreted accordingly.   Payments in the form of current cash and Shares are

Article II.
 
 
TAXATION AND TAX WITHHOLDING
2.1
 
Responsibility for Taxes
.
 
(a)
 
Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company, the ultimate liability for all
income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to Participant's
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Participant or deemed by the Company in its discretion to be an appropriate charge to
Participant even if legally applicable to the Company (“
Tax-Related Items
”) is and remains Participant’s responsibility and may exceed
the amount actually withheld by the Company.  Participant further acknowledges that the Company (i) makes no representations or
undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Shares, including, but not limited to,
the issuance or transfer of the Shares, the subsequent sale of the Shares, and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) does not commit to and
is under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant to reduce or eliminate Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve
any particular tax result.  Further, if Participant is subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, Participant acknowledges
that the Company may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
(b)
 
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant agrees to assist the Company
in satisfying any applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Company, or their respective agents, at
their discretion, may satisfy, or allow Participant to satisfy, the withholding obligation with regard to all Tax-Related Items by any of the
following, or a combination thereof:
(i)
 
By cash, check or wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided that the Company may
limit the use of one of the foregoing methods if one or more of the methods below is permitted;
(ii)
 
Delivery (including telephonically to the extent permitted by the Company) of a notice that
Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect to the Shares, and that the broker has
been directed to deliver promptly to the Company funds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items; provided that such
amount is paid to the Company at such time as may be required by the Company;
(iii)
 
To the extent permitted by the Administrator, surrendering Shares issued hereunder valued at their
Fair Market Value on such date; or
(iv)
 
By the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Participant.
(c)
 
The Company has the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat Participant’s failure to provide timely
payment of any Tax-Related Items as Participant's election to satisfy all or any portion of the Tax-Related Items pursuant to Section
2.1(b)(iii) or (iv) above, or a combination of such sections. 
(d)
 
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by
considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable
rates, in which case Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash through the Company’s normal payment
processes for members of the Board and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent.  If the obligation for Tax-Related
Items is satisfied by surrendering one or more Shares, solely for tax purposes and not intended to modify or restrict in any way Section
4.2 of the Plan, Participant is deemed to have been issued the
2
 
full number of Shares, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are surrendered for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
(e)
 
Finally, Participant agrees to pay to the Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may be
required to withhold or account for as a result of Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously
described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds from the sale of the Shares if Participant fails to
comply with Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

(b)
 
all decisions with respect to future stock issuances or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the
Administrator;
(c)
 
nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall in any way be construed or interpreted to adversely affect or
otherwise impair the right of the Company or its stockholders to remove Participant from the Board at any time in accordance with the
provisions of applicable law;
(d)
 
Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan;
(e)
 
the future value of the Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty; and
(f)
 
the following provision shall not apply if Participant resides in the State of California: In consideration of the
grant of the Shares, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Participant agrees not to institute any claim against the Company or
any Subsidiary, to waive Participant's ability, if any, to bring such claim, and release the Company and its Subsidiaries from any such
claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan,
Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary
to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim.

Participant understands that the Company may hold certain personal information about Participant, including, but not limited to,
Participant's name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, passport, social insurance number or other
identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all stock options,
deferred stock units or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in
Participant's favor (“Data”), for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
Participant understands that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Investments, or such other stock plan service provider as may be
selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the
Plan.  Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’
country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Participant's country.  Participant understands
that if Participant resides outside the United States Participant may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of
the Data by contacting Participant's local human resources representative.  Participant authorizes the Company, Fidelity Investments and
any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing
the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purpose of implementing, administering
and managing the Plan.  Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage
the Plan.  Participant understands that if Participant resides outside the United States, Participant may, at any time, view Data, request
information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein,
in any case without cost, by contacting in writing Participant's local human resources representative.  Further, Participant understands that
Participant is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If Participant does not consent, or if Participant later seeks to
revoke Participant's consent, Participant's service with the Company will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing
Participant's consent is that the Company may not be able to grant additional shares of Common Stock or other equity awards to
Participant or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing Participant's consent
may affect Participant's ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of Participant's refusal to consent or
withdrawal of consent, Participant understands that Participant may contact Participant's local human resources representative.

the foregoing.  In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan will control.
 
3.11

.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or invalid, the provision will be severable
from, and the illegality or invalidity of the provision will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.

3.12
 
Waiver
.  Participant acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by Participant or any other

Article I.
 
Award of DSU
s
 and dividend equivalents; SETTLEMENT
1.1
 
DSUs and Dividend Equivalents
. 
 
(a)
 
Effective as of the Grant Date specified above, the Company irrevocably grants to Participant an award of the
number of DSUs specified above.  Each DSU represents the right to receive one Share on the terms, and subject to the conditions, set
forth in this Agreement and the Plan.
 
    
(b)
 
 
Effective as of the Grant Date, the Company hereby grants to Participant a Dividend Equivalent for each
DSU evidenced by this Agreement.  Each Dividend Equivalent represents the right to receive additional DSUs for each ordinary cash
dividend paid on the outstanding shares of Common Stock that has a record date after the Grant Date set forth above and prior to the
settlement date of the DSU to which such Dividend Equivalent relates.  The aggregate number of additional DSUs issued pursuant to this
Agreement on all Dividend Equivalents for any ordinary cash dividend shall equal the product, rounded up to the nearest thousandth of a
DSU, of (A) the aggregate number of DSUs evidenced by this Agreement on the record date for such dividend (including additional
DSUs issued prior to the relevant record date pursuant to this Section 1.1(b), but excluding DSUs settled prior to the relevant record date),
multiplied by (B) the per Share dollar amount of such dividend, divided by (C) the closing sales price (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
for a Share, as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange for the last trading day immediately preceding the payment date of such
dividend.  All additional DSUs issued pursuant to this Section 1.1(b) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the original
DSUs to which they relate.  The addition of DSUs pursuant to this Section 1.1(b) shall continue until all of the DSUs evidenced by this
Agreement have been settled or otherwise expires.
1.2
 
Settlement
.
 
(a)
 
All of Participant’s DSUs and any related Dividend Equivalents will be paid in Shares in a single lump sum in
the first year following Participant’s Separation from Service (as such term is defined for purposes of the 3M Compensation Plan for
Nonemployee Directors).
(b)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1.2(a), if Participant completed and timely submitted to
the Company an election to defer receipt (the “
Payment  Election
”) of all or any of the Shares underlying the DSUs in a form acceptable
to the Company, then the Shares underlying the DSUs shall be distributable to Participant in accordance with the terms of the Payment
Election.
(c)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Plan, no DSUs or Dividend Equivalents
shall be distributed to Participant pursuant to this Section 1.2 during the six-month period following Participant’s separation from service
if the Company determines that distributing such DSUs and Dividend Equivalents at the time or times indicated in this Agreement would
be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.  If the distribution of all or any of Participant’s DSUs and
Dividend Equivalents is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then such portion of the DSUs and Dividend Equivalents shall be
paid to Participant during the thirty (30)-day period beginning on the first business day following the end of such six-month period (or
such earlier date upon which such DSUs and Dividend Equivalents can be distributed under Section 409A without resulting in a
prohibited distribution, including as a result of Participant’s death).
(d)
 
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, the time of distribution of the
DSUs and the Dividend Equivalents under this Agreement may not be changed except as may be permitted by the Administrator in
accordance with Section 409A and the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

appropriate charge to Participant even if legally applicable to the Company (“

The Company has the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat Participant’s failure to provide timely
payment of any Tax-Related Items as Participant's election to satisfy all or any portion of the Tax-Related Items pursuant to Section
2.1(b)(iii) or (iv) above, or a combination of such sections. 
(d)
 
 
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by
considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable
rates, in which case Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash through the Company’s normal payment
processes for members of the Board and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent.  If the obligation for Tax-Related
Items is satisfied by surrendering Shares, solely for tax purposes and not intended to modify or restrict in any way Section 4.2 of the Plan,
Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the DSU, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are
surrendered for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
(e)
 
 
Finally, Participant agrees to pay to the Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may
be required to withhold or account for as a result of Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously
described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds from the sale of the Shares if Participant fails to
comply with Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

Article III.
 
other provisions
3.1
 
Nature of Grant
.  In accepting the DSUs, Participant understands, acknowledges, and agrees that:
(a)
 
the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified,
amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time in accordance with its terms;
(b)
 
all decisions with respect to future DSU or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the
Administrator;
(c)
 
 
nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall in any way be construed or interpreted to adversely affect or
otherwise impair the right of the Company or its stockholders to remove Participant from the Board at any time in accordance with the
provisions of applicable law;
(d)
 
Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan;
(e)
 
the future value of the Shares underlying the DSUs is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with
certainty;
(f)
 
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Administrator, the DSUs and the benefits evidenced by this
Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the DSUs or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor to be
exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Common Stock; and
(g)
 
 
the following provision shall not apply if Participant resides in the State of California: In consideration of the
grant of the DSUs, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Participant agrees not to institute any claim against the Company or any
Subsidiary, to waive Participant's ability, if any, to bring such claim, and release the Company and its Subsidiaries from any such claim;
if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan,
Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to
request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim.
3.2
 
 
Relationship to Other Plans
.  The grant of DSUs and Dividend Equivalents under this Agreement constitutes payment
of fees for services as a member of the Board in accordance with the terms of the 3M Compensation Plan for Nonemployee Directors.
3.3
 
No Advice Regarding Grant
.  The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company
making recommendations regarding participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares.  Participant
understands and agrees that Participant should consult with Participant's own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding
participation in the Plan before taking any action related to his or her Award(s).
3.4
 
Data Privacy
.  Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in
electronic or other form, of Participant's personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as
applicable, the Company and its other Subsidiaries for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
Participant understands that the Company may hold certain personal information about Participant, including, but not limited to,
Participant's name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, passport, social insurance number or other
identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all stock options,
deferred stock units or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in
Participant's favor (“Data”), for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
4
 
Participant understands that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Investments, or such other stock plan service provider as may be
selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the
Plan.  Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’
country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Participant's country.  Participant understands
that if Participant resides outside the United States Participant may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of
the Data by contacting Participant's local human resources representative.  Participant authorizes the Company, Fidelity Investments and
any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing
the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purpose of implementing, administering
and managing the Plan.  Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage
the Plan.  Participant understands that if Participant resides outside the United States, Participant may, at any time, view Data, request
information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein,
in any case without cost, by contacting in writing Participant's local human resources representative.  Further, Participant understands that
Participant is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If Participant does not consent, or if Participant later seeks to
revoke Participant's consent, Participant's service with the Company will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing
Participant's consent is that the Company may not be able to grant additional shares of Common Stock or other equity awards to
Participant or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing Participant's consent
may affect Participant's ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of Participant's refusal to consent or
withdrawal of consent, Participant understands that Participant may contact Participant's local human resources representative.
3.5
 
Transferability
. The DSUs are not transferable, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or as permitted by
the Administrator in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
3.6
 
Adjustments
.  Participant acknowledges that the DSUs, the Shares subject to the DSUs and the Dividend Equivalents
are subject to adjustment, modification and termination in certain events as provided in this Agreement and the Plan.
 
3.7
 
Defined Terms; Titles
.  Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan.
Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Agreement.
 
3.8
 
Conformity to Applicable Laws
.  Participant acknowledges that the Plan and this Agreement are intended to conform to
the extent necessary with all Applicable Laws and, to the extent Applicable Laws permit, will be deemed amended as necessary to
conform to Applicable Laws.
 
3.9
 
Successors and Assigns
.  The Company may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to single or multiple
assignees, and this Agreement will inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company.  Subject to the transfer provisions
set forth in the Plan, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legatees, legal representatives, successors
and assigns of the parties hereto.
 
3.10
 
Entire Agreement and Imposition of Other Terms
.  The Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Participant with respect to the subject
matter hereof.  Nonetheless, the Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Participant’s participation in the Plan, on
the DSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or
administrative reasons, and to require Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish
the foregoing.  In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan will control.
 
3.11
 
Severability
.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or invalid, the provision will be severable
from, and the illegality or invalidity of the provision will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.
 
5
 
3.12
 
Waiver
.  Participant acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by Participant or any other
person.
 
3.13
 
Limitation on Participant’s Rights
.  Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein
provided.  This Agreement creates a contractual arrangement between the Company and Participant only and shall not be construed as
creating a trust for the benefit of Participant.  Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets.  Participant
will have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any,
with respect to the DSUs and Dividend Equivalents, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured
creditor with respect to the DSUs and Dividend Equivalents, as and when settled pursuant to the terms hereof.
 
3.14
 
Electronic Delivery and Acceptance
.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related
to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means.  Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic
delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a
third party designated by the Company.
 
3.15
 
Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws
. Participant acknowledges that, depending on Participant’s country, or
broker’s country, or the country in which the Shares are listed, Participant may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market
abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions, which may affect Participant’s ability to, directly or indirectly, accept, acquire, sell, or attempt to
sell or otherwise dispose of Shares or rights to Shares under the Plan during such times when Participant is considered to have “inside
information” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws or regulations in the applicable jurisdictions or Participant’s
country).  Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders placed by Participant before
possessing inside information.  Furthermore, Participant understands that he or she may be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside
information to any third party, including Company employees (other than on a “need to know” basis) and (ii) “tipping” third parties or
causing them to otherwise buy or sell securities.  Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any
restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company.  Participant acknowledges that Participant
is responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable restrictions and should consult Participant’s personal legal advisor on these
matters.
 
3.16
 
Section 409A
.   The intent of the parties is that the payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section
409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall
be interpreted to be in compliance therewith.  For purposes of Section 409A, each payment that Participant may be eligible to receive
under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate and distinct payment.
 
3.17
 
Governing Law and Venue
.
 This Agree
ment and the DSUs and the Dividend Equivalents will be governed by and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, disregarding the choice-of-law principles of the State of Delaware and

concerning the grant of the DSUs, the Dividend Equivalents or this Agreement, Participant consents to the jurisdiction of the State of
Minnesota and agrees that such litigation shall be conducted exclusively in the courts of Ramsey County, Minnesota, or the federal
courts for the United States for the District of Minnesota, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.
