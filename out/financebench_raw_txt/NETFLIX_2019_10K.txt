Business ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix
”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading subscription streaming entertainment service with over 167 million  paid streaming memberships 
in over 190  countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members canwatch as much as they want, anyti
me, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials.Additionally, over two million 
members in the United States ("U.S.") subscribe to our legacy DVD-by-mail service.We are a pioneer in th
e delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem forinternet-connected screens an
d have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens.As a result of these effor
ts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.Our core strategy is to grow our st
reaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuouslyimproving our members' expe
rience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts newmembers. In addition, we ar
e continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members candownload a selection of tit
les for offline viewing.BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Effective in the four
th quarter of 2019, we operate our business as one global operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthlymembership fees for se
rvices related to streaming content to our members. See Note 10, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statement
s for further detail.COMPETITION
The market for streaming entertai
nment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, suchas multichannel video prog
ramming distributors ("MVPDs"), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gamingproviders and more broadly ag
ainst other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete againststreaming enterta
inment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.While consumers may ma
intain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments offree time. We have o
ften referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, weare continually improv
ing our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own originalprogramming.
1

Table of ContentsSEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a s
easonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increasetheir viewing. Historical
ly, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membershipgrowth can be impacted by our con
tent release schedule and changes to pricing.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectualproperty as important to ou
r success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect ourproprietary intellectual property
. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounterdisputes over rights and obliga
tions concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.EMPLOYEES
As of 
December 31, 2019 , we had approximately 8,600  full-time employees. OTHER INFORMATION

Risk Factors If any of the following risks ac
tually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of ourcommon stock could decline, and you could 
lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Our Business
If our efforts to attract and re
tain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.We have experienced sign
ificant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our abilityto consistently provide our m
embers with compelling content choices, effectively market our service, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting andviewing TV series and movies. Further
more, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adverselyimpact our ability to 
attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainmentproviders (including those th
at provide pirated content), as well as video gaming providers and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our memberscould choose in their momen
ts of free time. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existingfeatures, adjust pric
ing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract andretain members. In add
ition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfyour existing members ar
e not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adverselyaffected. Members c
ancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses,availability of content is 
unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Wemust continually add new memb
erships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we permitmultiple users within the s
ame household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if account sharing is abused, our ability to add new members maybe hindered and our results of op
erations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed innature and contracted ov
er several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the loweredgrowth rate such that our ma
rgins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and newcompetitors in both ret
aining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers ofmembers cancel our service, 
we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members withnew members.
Changes in competitive offerings for ent
ertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impactour business.
The market for enter
tainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers haveincreasing options to acc
ess entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported andpiracy-based models. 
All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damageour business, as its fundamenta
l proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light ofthe compelling consumer p
roposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters andcable network operators
, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of thesecompetitors have long oper
ating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketingand other resources. They may s
ecure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology,infrastructure, cont
ent acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings orapproaches to providing ente
rtainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If weare unable to successful
ly or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase ormaintain market share, revenue
s or profitability.The long-term and fixed cost nature of our content com
mitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results ofoperations.
In connection with licensing s
treaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter intomulti-year commi
tments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent
 agreements.3

Table of ContentsThe payment terms of thes
e agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs ofproduction or tied to such fa
ctors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, areincluded in the Contractua
l Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" andNote 5, 
Commitments and Contingencies  in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements andSupplementary Data" of this Annual Repo
rt on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membershipacquisition and retent
ion do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as contentwe directly produce, will typ
ically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production ofsuch content. To the extent m
embership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected asa result of content commitment
s and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our contentcommitments may li
mit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/orproduce content that is not 
favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adverselyimpacted and given the long
-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results ofoperation may be adverse
ly impacted.We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liabil
ity in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through ourservice.
As a producer and distributor of 
content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the natureand content of materials that
 we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service,including marketing ma
terials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming,including TV series and movies. W
e believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwiseattract and reta
in members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, ourbusiness, including our brand and resu
lts of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible forproduction costs and other expens
es, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk.Negotiations or renewals re
lated to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with ourproductions. We contract wi
th third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.  We may face potentialliability or may suff
er losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent orengage in fraudulent behav
ior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights tothird parties, we coul
d become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove contentfrom our service, not to pl
ace licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might notbe well received by our me
mbers, or could be damaging to our brand or business.To the extent we do not accura
tely anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removedfrom our service, or if we b
ecome liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims couldbe costly and the expenses and da
mages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnifiedagainst claims or costs o
f these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.If studios, content providers or other rights holders r
efuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could beadversely affected.
Our ability to provide our me
mbers with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, includingdistribution rights, to such con
tent and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. Thelicense periods and the t
erms and conditions of such licenses vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide uswith access to certain 
content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or ableto license us content upon te
rms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certainlicenses for content prov
ide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as wellas other actions we may tak
e, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certainprogramming increase. As we se
ek to differentiate our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, includingoriginal content. We a
re also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we areselective about the t
itles we add and4

Table of Contentsrenew to our service. If we do not 
maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.Music and certain authors
’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, weengage in negotiations with co
llection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in connection with streamingcontent into various ter
ritories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or couldbe enjoined from distribu
ting certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiationsbetween certain CMOs and other th
ird parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers representedby certain CMOs unilateral
ly withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure toreach such licensing agr
eements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for thedigital distribution of 
content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors and performers could expose us to greater distribution expenses.If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
We are expanding our opera
tions internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members andfeatures related 
to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As ourinternational offe
ring evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular thosedealing with e-commer
ce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developingtechnology and utilizing th
ird-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number ofdisciplines, including cr
eative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production ofcontent. Further, we may expand our 
content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration andoperational challeng
es as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire orcontrol. If we are not abl
e to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practicesrelated to our strea
ming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.We could be subject to economic, politica
l, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.Operating in international
 markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and otherrisks that may be diffe
rent from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks thatcould adversely affec
t our business, including:•
the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;•
difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;•
political or social unrest and economic instability;•
compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economicsanctions, and local laws prohib
iting corrupt payments to government officials;•
difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including local ownership requirements forstreaming content provid
ers;•
regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatoryrequirements or otherwis
e, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;•
foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, amongother issues, may impact
 the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual propertyrights;
•
adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment indetermining our global 
provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination isuncertain;
•
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which will impact revenuesand expenses of our internat
ional operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;•
profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;5

Table of Contents•
differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;•
new and different sources of competition;•
censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction withour service;
•
low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;•
different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, andlocal ownership requirem
ents;•
availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;•
differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;•
negative impacts from trade disputes; and•
implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture andeconomic activity, in
cluding local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the European Unionrecently revised its Audio Visu
al Media Services Directive to require that European works comprise at least thirty (30) percent of media serviceproviders’ catalogs, and to 
require prominence of those works.Our failure to manage any o
f these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.We are subject to taxation relat
ed risks in multiple jurisdictions.We are a U.S.-based multina
tional company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining ourglobal provision for income 
taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions areconsistent with the tax laws in 
the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional taxauthorities, which may have 
a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.Tax laws are being re-exa
mined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in thequarter or year that 
they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, aswell as a number of other coun
tries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes toexisting tax laws that, if 
enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable taxlaws, our overall taxes could 
increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets 
establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able toattract or retain membe
rs, and our operating results may be adversely affected.We believe that a positive re
putation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, ouroriginal programming, is p
erceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputationmay be adversely impacted.
 To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatoryaction or behavior, includ
ing being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightenedregulatory scrutiny ac
ross our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent ourresponse to government act
ion or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establishand maintain a positive 
reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to theextent we are not successfu
l in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.Changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our 
marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.We utilize a broad m
ix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service and content to existing and potentialnew members. We may limit 
or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned thatmembers or potential members 
deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed,our ability to engage mem
bers and attract new members may be adversely affected.6

Table of ContentsCompanies that promote our se
rvice may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us.For example, if they decid
e that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longerhave access to their m
arketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously canceled their membership. If we areunable to maintain or r
eplace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels andmarketing expenses may be 
adversely affected.We utilize marke
ting to promote our content, drive conversation about our content and service, and drive viewing by our members. To the extent we promoteour content ineffici
ently or ineffectively, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.We rely upon a number of partners to make our service avai
lable on their devices.We currently offer 
members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players,television set-top boxe
s and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service availablethrough the television set
-top boxes of these service providers, some of whom may have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances,our agreements also inc
lude provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connectionwith offering our service. 
If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-servicediscovery interfaces, ou
r service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase ourcapability to strea
m TV series and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating newrelationships, or if we encoun
ter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members viathese devices, our abili
ty to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.Our agreements with our partn
ers are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, anumber of our partners do not con
tinue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree ofaccessibility and prom
inence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should beresponsible for the devic
es’ performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix andsuch dissatisfaction could 
result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionalitymay require that par
tners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not updateor otherwise modify their d
evices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer syste
ms or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including thoserelating to cybersecurity or a
rising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including memberand corporate information, or theft of int
ellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.Our reputation and ability 
to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems andthose of third parties th
at we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverseweather conditions, other na
tural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions inthese systems, or with the int
ernet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Serviceinterruptions, errors in ou
r software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membershipservice to existing and pot
ential members.Our computer systems and those of 
third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computerviruses, denial of servic
e attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to leadto interruptions and delays 
in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information and other data, confidential information orintellectual prope
rty. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gainaccess to data. Any attemp
t by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets),disrupt our service, or othe
rwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damageour reputation. We have i
mplemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, but the techniques used to gainunauthorized access to da
ta and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. Because of our prominence,we (and/or third parties
 we use) may be a particularly attractive target for7

Table of Contentssuch attacks, and from ti
me to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releaseshave not had a materia
l impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems inthe future. Our insurance does no
t cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service orotherwise accessing our syste
ms are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies changeand efforts to overcome 
security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering andsystems. Any significant disrupt
ion to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results ofoperation. Further, a penet
ration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business,regulatory, litigat
ion and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We utilize our own communi
cations and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilizethird-party “cloud” co
mputing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help usstream TV series and movies 
in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other networkproviders, including technolog
ical or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact theexperience of our members.
We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate cer
tain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon WebServices operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.
Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) prov
ides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a"cloud" computing service. W
e have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other servicesprovided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast m
ajority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operationsto another cloud provider, any d
isruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.While the retail s
ide of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantageagainst our service, al
though if it was to do so it could harm our business.If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not opera
te to expectations, our business and results of operation could beadversely impacted.
We utilize a combin
ation of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed torecommend and merchand
ise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumerelectronic devices. For 
example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do notinterconnect with our CDN or charge us 
to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectivelydeliver our streaming 
content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if ourrecommendation and me
rchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retainmembers may be adverse
ly affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the dailyoperations of our business. If our 
technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of“bugs” in our development and dep
loyment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Anyharm to our members’ pe
rsonal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and financia
l condition.If government regulations relating to 
the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct ourbusiness, or incur greater operating expenses.
The adoption or modificat
ion of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the mannerin which we currently conduct our bus
iness. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking tointroduce new or extend lega
cy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, recent changes to European lawenables individual member 
states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. We anticipate that severaljurisdictions may, over t
ime, impose greater financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for onlinecommerce may lead 
to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations orlegislation or new interp
retations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.8

Table of ContentsChanges in laws or regulations tha
t adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease thedemand for our service and 
increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal trafficthat traverse thei
r networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent.Furthermore, favorable 
laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty aroundthese rules, including chang
ing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local networkoperators, we could experien
ce discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwisenegatively affect ou
r business.Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across the
ir networks could adversely impact our business.We rely upon the ability o
f consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our serviceover their networks, our servi
ce and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, includingmeaningful bandwidth caps, or oth
erwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and ourmembership acquisition an
d retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and eithercharge us for or prohibit us f
rom being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.Most network operators that prov
ide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such,many network operators have an 
incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe thatconsumer demand, regulato
ry oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferentialtreatment to thei
r data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. Theextent to which these
 incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.Privacy concerns could limit our abili
ty to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personalinformation and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect andutilize information supplied
 by our members, which may include personal information and other data. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding themanner in which we treat such 
information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Priva
cy Act ("CCPA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA, other data privacy laws orregulations, or relat
ed contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings bygovernmental entiti
es and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputationand market position.
Other businesses have been cri
ticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to datacollected on the inte
rnet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings underexisting laws that limi
t our ability to collect, transfer and use information and other data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were todisclose information and o
ther data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and wecould face potential legal claims
 that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legalobligations concerning our t
reatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export.Failure to comply with these ob
ligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to theseobligations, we could incur addi
tional expenses.Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if membe
r personal information and other data, particularly billing data, were to beaccessed by unauthorized persons.
We maintain personal 
information and other data regarding our members, including names and billing information. This information and data is maintainedon our own systems as well as that of th
ird parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryptionand authentication te
chnology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and otherdata. Despite these measu
res we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusioninto our members’ infor
mation and other data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to usnecessary for them to r
emain or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including the EU LeadData Protection
9

Table of ContentsAuthority) as well as the indiv
iduals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines orpenalties for such a bre
ach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. Wealso maintain personal 
information and other data concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should anunauthorized intrusion into ou
r members’ or employees’ personal information and other data and/or production personal information occur, our business could beadversely affected and our
 larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.We are subject to payment processing risk.
Our members pay for our servi
ce using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, onlinewallets and direct ca
rrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of thesepayment methods are su
bject to certain rules and regulations, including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require paymentof interchange and other 
fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuancesof payment cards, delays in 
receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/ordisruptions or failures in ou
r payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, ourrevenue, operating expenses 
and results of operation could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and otherpartners to bill subscrib
ers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have totransition subscribers or o
therwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition,from time to time, we 
encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managedcould create negative cons
umer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks mayimpose fines, our card
 approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability toprocess payments on any major p
ayment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequate
ly protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brandand other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affect
ed.We rely and expect to con
tinue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties withwhom we have relationships, as well 
as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforceour proprietary rights th
rough court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications.Nevertheless, these appli
cations may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties mayknowingly or unknowingly infringe our inte
llectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantialexpense to us. If the protec
tion of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content,and other intangible asse
ts may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of ourbusiness and service
 to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.We currently hold various do
main names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect ourreputation and brand and mak
e it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent thirdparties from acquir
ing domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.Intellectual property claims aga
inst us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streamingtechnology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, tit
le selection processes and marketing activities.Trademark, copyright, pat
ent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to ourtechnology, business processes and th
e content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some ofour content, merchandising ou
r products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. Ifwe are unable to obtain suff
icient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timelybasis in response to claims 
against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business andcompetitive position may 
be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect manyaspects of our business. There a
re numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not10

Table of Contentssearched patents rel
ative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined inour favor, results in costly 
litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streamingtechnology, our recommenda
tion and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to removecontent from our servic
e, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, ente
r into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve theclaims. These actions, i
f required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unfores
een expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's timeand attention.
From time to time, we ar
e subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, wehave seen a rise in the numb
er of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringementclaims, employment r
elated litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes couldcause us to incur unforeseen 
expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's timeand attention, any of which could n
egatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas andother types of informat
ion requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities.While the ultimate outcome of i
nvestigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive,time-consuming and distr
acting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices,reputational harm or 
costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.We may seek additional capital that may result 
in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.From time to time, we may s
eek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. Our cash flows provided by our operatingactivities have been n
egative in each of the last five years, primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available on ourservice. We expect our 
cash flows from operations to continue to be negative for some time, and anticipate seeking additional capital. The decision to obtainadditional capital wi
ll depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capitalmarkets could make it 
more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through theissuance of equity, equity-
linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and ourstockholders may experien
ce dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obliga
tions, which could adversely affect our financialposition.
We have a substantial a
mount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we expect to incur substantialadditional indebtedness in 
the future and to incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult orcostly to access, our abil
ity to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2019 , we had the equivalent of $14.9 billion  aggregate principal amount of senio
r notes outstanding (“Notes”), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into arevolving credit agre
ement that provides for a $750 million  unsecured revolving credi t facility. As of December 31, 2019 , we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit f
acility. As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $7.7 billion  of total content liabilities a s reflected on our consolidated balance sheet,some of which is denominated in 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteriafor liability recogn
ition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidatedbalance sheet, see Note 5, 
Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,"Financial Statements and Suppl
ementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streamingcontent obligations, may:
•
make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our otherobligations;
•
limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;11

Table of Contents•
increase our cost of borrowing;•
limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general businesspurposes;
•
require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;•
limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;•
place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and•
increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.Our streaming obligations in
clude large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in ourcash flows from operations by r
educing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at anunfavorable time, which m
ay negatively impact our stock price.The interest rate of bo
rrowings under our revolving credit agreement makes reference to an adjusted London interbank offered rate ("LIBO Rate"). It ispossible that beginning in 2022, the L
IBO Rate will be discontinued as a reference rate. Under our revolving credit agreement, in the event of the discontinuance ofthe LIBO Rate, a mutually agre
ed-upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate.  In the event that an agreement cannot be reachedon an appropriate benchma
rk rate, the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be adversely impacted.We may not be able to generate suffici
ent cash to service our debt and other obligations.Our ability to make paymen
ts on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which issubject to prevailing e
conomic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In each of the last five years, ourcash flows from operating a
ctivities have been negative. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay theprincipal, premium, i
f any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.If we are unable to servi
ce our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior tomaturity. Our ability to 
refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition atsuch time. Any refinancing or 
restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could furtherrestrict our business oper
ations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any ofthese obligations on comme
rcially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations, or financia
l condition.If our cash flows are insuff
icient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could facesubstantial liquidity prob
lems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debtand other obligations. We c
annot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that theproceeds from such alte
rnatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternativemeasures, our business, results o
f operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire quali
fied employees.We rely on the continued se
rvice of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executiveteam and other key employ
ees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilledbusiness, product development, t
echnical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, are not successful in recruiting new personnel orin retaining and motiva
ting existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted.Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.
Our partners, suppliers, vendors and we 
employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who aresubject to collectiv
e bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may berenewed on terms that ar
e unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, then it is possible that the affected unions could takeaction in the form of st
rikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective12

r a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducingprofit margins.
Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that s
tockholders may consider favorable.Our charter documents may d
iscourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:•
authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;•
provide for a classified board of directors;•
prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;•
establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and•
prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.As a Delaware corporation, we ar
e also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in abusiness combination with any holde
r of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board ofdirectors has approved the 
transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.In addition, a merger or 
acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated ExecutiveSeverance and Retention Inc
entive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.Our stock price is volatile.
The price at which our common s
tock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including thefollowing, some of which are beyond our 
control:•
variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income and free cash flow;•
variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;•
announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;•
competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;•
market volatility in general;•
the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and•
the operating results of our competitors.As a result of these and other 
factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.Following certain peri
ods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more suchlitigation following futu
re periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.Preparing and forecasting our financial results r
equires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results. Given the dynamic nature of ou
r business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income andnumber of paid membershi
p additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline inthe trading price of our 
common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United 
States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,disclosures of contingent ass
ets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reportedperiods. We base such estim
ates on historical experience and on various other13

Table of Contentsassumptions that we believe 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate theamortization patt
ern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series or movie based upon various factorsincluding historical and
 estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would bechanged and could affect 
the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which couldcause us to miss our earnings guid
ance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price.Item 1B.

ear ended December 31, 2019  increased 28%  as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . The increase in our consolidated revenues was due to 
the 23%  growth in average paying memberships and a 5%  increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. Theincrease in average 
monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreignexchange rates.
The increase in operat
ing margin is due primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license andproduce content, including mo
re Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing expenses and headcount costs to support continued improvements in ourstreaming service, our 
international expansion, and our growing content production activities.Streaming Revenues
    
We derive revenues from mo
nthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membershipplans, the price of which var
ies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2019 , pricing on our plans ranged fro m the U.S. dollar equivalent of $3 to 
$22 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and pricevariations.

ign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchangerates had remained cons
tant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , our revenues would have been approxi
mately $762 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year endedDecember 31, 2018
. Cost of Revenues
Amortization of strea
ming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production ofstreaming content (such 
as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent,miscellaneous production 
related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost ofrevenues. We have built our own glob
al content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over theinternet. Streaming de
livery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs,such as cloud computing costs, assoc
iated with delivering streaming content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and paymentprocessing fees, including thos
e we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.

In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act o
f 2017, we simplified our global corporate structure, effective April 1, 2019. The tax impacts of suchsimplifications were no
t material to the financial statements taken as a whole. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the United States Treasury issued final regulationswith respect to certa
in aspects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additional guidance provided in these regulations resulted in a tax adjustment in thefourth quarter of 2019. We pa
id U.S. Federal taxes for the full year inclusive of this fourth quarter adjustment.The increase in our effective
 tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019  as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018  is primarily due to the g lobalcorporate structure s
implification, lower benefit from the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, and a lower benefit on a percentage basisfrom Federal and Californ
ia research and development ("R&D") credits. The one-time transition tax benefit under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118")that provided a measure
ment period to address the U.S. GAAP impacts associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is no longer applicable in 2019.In 2019, the difference be
tween our 9%  effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21%  was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits ofstock-based compensation, Fede
ral and California R&D credits, and the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017, partially offset by statetaxes, foreign taxes, and non-d
eductible expenses.

ting performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financingon terms acceptable 
to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences orprivileges senior to the 
rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.Our primary uses of cash includ
e the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs.Cash payment terms for non-or
iginal content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular contentthat we produce and own, require mo
re cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advanceof when the content is avail
able on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content,particularly in orig
inal content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future net cash used in operating activities and negative free cash flows for manyyears. We currently an
ticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continueto be sufficient to me
et our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.Free Cash Flow
We define free cash 
flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturitiesand sales of short-term 
investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cashgenerated that is ava
ilable to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, includinginvestments in global str
eaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as asubstitute for, net incom
e, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented inaccordance with GAAP.
In assessing liquidity in re
lation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences areexcess content payments ove
r amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. Working capital differencesinclude deferred rev
enue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Ourreceivables from members generally
 settle quickly.25

For the purpose of this table, con
tractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding andthat specify all significant term
s, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timingof the transaction. The exp
ected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2019
. Timing of payments and actu al amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts forsome obligations. The following t

As of December 31, 2019 , streaming content oblig ations were comprised of $4.4 billion  included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.3 billion  of "Non- current content liab
ilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $11.8 billion  of obligations that are no t reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets asthey did not then meet
 the criteria for recognition.26

Table of ContentsStreaming content obliga
tions include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. An obligation for the production ofcontent includes non-ca
ncelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligationfor the acquisition and
 licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a contentliability is record
ed on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimatequantity and/or fees for whi
ch are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements wherethe number of seasons to be ai
red is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include anyestimated obligation 
for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknownobligations are expect
ed to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion  over the next three yea rs, with the paymentsfor the vast majority o
f such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgmentsand the actual amounts m
ay differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligationstable above.

Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 4  Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financia

See Note 3 Leases in the accompanying notes to ou r consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company has additional operat
ing leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $699 million  which has been included above. Tota l leaseobligations as of 
December 31, 2019  increased $1,049  million from $1,708 million  as of December 31, 2018  to $2,757 million as of December 31, 2019  due to growth in facilities 
to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.(4)
Other purchase obligati ons include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloudcomputing costs, as well as othe
r miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.As of 
December 31, 2019 , we had gross unrecognized tax bene fits of $67 million  which was classified in “Other non -current liabilities” and a reduction todeferred tax assets which was 
classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonablypossible adjustments to the b
alance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have transactions wi
th unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we havefinancial guarantees, sub
ordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks,contingent liabilit
ies, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risksupport to us.

The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof the financial sta
tements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") hasdefined a company’s cri
tical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations,and which require a company to 
make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies andjudgments addressed below. We bas
e our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under thecircumstances. Actual result
s may differ from these estimates.27

Table of ContentsStreaming Content
We acquire, license 
and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of entertainment. The contentlicenses are for a f
ixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cashpayments relative to the amortizati
on expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classifiedwithin "Net cash used in operating 
activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.We recognize content 
assets (licensed and produced) as "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For licenses, we capitalize thefee per title and r
ecord a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title isaccepted and availab
le for streaming. For productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and productionoverhead. Participations 
and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on theConsolidated Statements of Oper
ations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with themonth of first availab
ility. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandisingand marketing efforts, an
d film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced streaming contentasset is expected to be
 amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on aregular basis. Our e
stimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.Our business model is subscription bas
ed as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) arepredominantly monetiz
ed as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expectedusefulness of the content or 
that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. Ifsuch changes are identif
ied in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costsfor assets that have been, o
r are expected to be, abandoned are written off.Income Taxes
We record a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.Deferred income taxes are reco
gnized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carryingamounts of existing assets and 
liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assetsand liabilities of a 
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, ifnecessary, by a valuation a
llowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.Although we believe our assumptions, judg
ments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of anytax audits could signific
antly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our abili
ty to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our pastoperating results, and our fo
recast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized indetermining future t
axable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.Actual operating results 
in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not thatmost of the deferred t
ax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxassets to the net amount th
at we believe is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2019  the valuation allowance o f $135 million was primarily relatedto foreign tax credits 
that we are not expected to realize.We did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it ismore likely than not the 
tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefitsrecognized in the financial 
statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%  likelihood of being realizedupon settlement. At 
December 31, 2019 , our estimated gross unrecogn ized tax benefits were $67 million  of which $57  million, if recognized, would favorablyimpact our future ea
rnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may changeand the actual tax benefits
 may differ significantly from the estimates.See Note 8 to the consolidated f
inancial statements for further information regarding income taxes.28

Table of ContentsHistorical Segment Information
Historically, we reported 
contribution profit (loss) for three  segments: Domestic stre aming, International streaming and Domestic DVD, which was reflectiveof how our chief operating dec
ision maker ("CODM") reviewed financial information for the purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financialperformance and allo
cating resources. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment.Because we increasingly obta
in multi-territory or global rights for streaming content, contribution profit (loss) on a regional basis is no longer a meaningful metricreviewed by the CODM or used in the alloc
ation of resources.Effective in the four
th quarter of 2019, we operate as a single operating segment. Our CODM is our chief executive officer, who reviews financialinformation presented on 
a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources.As the transition to one segmen
t occurred during 2019, we are providing supplemental pro-forma information reflecting our historic segment reporting as if ithad remained in place

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Ma rket RiskWe are exposed to marke
t risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currencyfluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
At 
December 31, 2019, our cash equivalents were gen erally invested in money market funds. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailinginterest rate.
As of 
December 31, 2019 , we had $14.9 billion  of debt, consisting of fixed r ate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2021 and 2030. Refer toNote 4 to the consolidated fin
ancial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasingin periods of declining ra
tes of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes inforeign currency rat
es, as discussed below.Foreign Currency Risk
Revenues denominated in curr
encies other than the U.S. dollar account for 50%  of the consolidated amount for the year ended December 31, 2019 . We therefore have fore
ign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, theJapanese yen, the Mexican peso 
and the Brazilian real.Accordingly, changes in exchange 
rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue andoperating income as expr
essed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , 30

Table of Contentsour revenues would have been approxi
mately $762 million  higher had foreign currency exch ange rates remained constant with those for the year endedDecember 31, 2018
. We have also experienc
ed and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurementof monetary assets and li
abilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2019 , we recognized a $7 million foreign exchange gain due to 
the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liabilitypositions denominated in cur
rencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.Exchange rate changes had an 
immaterial impact on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2019 . We do not use foreign exchange 
contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factorsthat we cannot forecast wi
th reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result suchfluctuations could have a s
ignificant impact on our future results of operations.Item 8.

Controls and Procedures (a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the par
ticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand procedures (as defined 
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evalua
tion, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls andprocedures as of the end of th
e period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required tobe disclosed by us in reports tha
t we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reportedwithin the time periods spe
cified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated toour management, including ou
r Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our management, including our Chi
ef Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or ourinternal controls will p
revent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the obje
ctives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and thebenefits of controls must b
e considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provideabsolute assurance that 
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsibl
e for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 as 
amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2019
. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (“COSO”) in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessm ent under the framework in Internal Control— Integrated Framework 
(2013 framework), our manage ment concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019 . The effectiveness of our in
ternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019  has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independ ent registered publicaccounting firm, as sta
ted in their report that is included herein. 
(c)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our intern
al control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019  that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
 to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Netflix,
 Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control - IntegratedFramework issued by the Committe
e of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix,Inc. (the Company) mai
ntained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of the Company as of 
December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the related consolida ted statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cashflows for each of the thre
e years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes and ou r report dated January 29, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep
endent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective inter
nal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating ef
fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.

We have audited the ac

ions, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred t
o as the “consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all materialrespects, the financi
al position of the Company at December 31, 2019  and 2018 , and the results of its oper ations and its cash flows for each of the three years in theperiod ended 
December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 29, 2020  expressed an unqualified opin ion thereon.Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidat
ed financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption ofAccounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) , and the related amend ments.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated
 below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to becommunicated to the audit c
ommittee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective o
r complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financialstatements, taken as a whol
e, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on theaccounts or disclosures to which 
it relates.39

Content Amortization Description of the Matter
As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolida ted financial statements "Organization and Summary of Significant AccountingPolicies", the Company acquires, 
licenses and produces content, including original programming ("Streaming Content").The Company amortizes Strea
ming Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.Auditing the amortizat
ion of the Company's Streaming Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental natureof amortization which is b
ased on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based onhistorical and forec
asted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period ofamortization would be chang
ed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization. 
 How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the contentamortization process. For 
example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method andthe significant assumpt
ions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimatedviewing patterns. We also t
ested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete andaccurate.
To test content amorti
zation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method,testing the significan
t assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness andaccuracy of the underly
ing data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to currentviewing trends and current ope
rating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actualresults. We also perfor
med sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recordedthat could result from 
changes in the assumptions.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business
Netflix, Inc. (the “Company”
) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leadingsubscription streaming e
ntertainment service with over 167 million  paid streaming membe rships in over 190  countries enjoying TV series, documentaries andfeature films ac
ross a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen.Members can play, pause and r
esume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, over two million  members in the United Stat es ("U.S.") subscribe to ourlegacy DVD-by-mail service.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financi
al statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions havebeen eliminated.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amoun
ts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been reclassified to conform to thecurrent period present
ation. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the amortization of DVD content assets has been reclassified into "Other non-cashitems" within "Cash flows from oper
ating activities". In addition, cash flows from the acquisition of DVD content assets have been reclassified into "Change inother assets" within "Cash flows from 
investing activities". In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, DVD content assets have been reclassified from "Non-currentcontent assets, net" to "Other non
-current assets" and DVD content liabilities have been reclassified from "Current content liabilities" and "Non-current contentliabilities" to "Accru
ed expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities", respectively. There is no change to consolidated operating income, netincome or cash flows as a resu
lt of this change in classification.Use of Estimates
The preparation of con
solidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requiresmanagement to make es
timates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe financial stat
ements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates andassumptions include the str
eaming content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company basesits estimates on histor
ical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis,the Company evaluates these 
assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accoun
ting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase t ransparency andcomparability among org
anizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under priorGAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recogni
ze a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right touse the underlying asset for 
the lease term on the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modifiedretrospective trans
ition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. The Company has electedthe package of practi
cal expedients, which allows the Company not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts as of the adoption date are or contain alease, (2) lease cl
assification for any expired or existing leases as of the adoption date and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases as of the adoption date. TheCompany did not elect to apply th
e hindsight practical expedient when determining lease term and assessing impairment of right-of-use assets. The adoption ofASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 resulted in the recogn
ition of right-of-use assets of approximately $743 million , lease liabiliti es for operating leases ofapproximately 
$813 million  and a cumulative-ef fect adjustment on retained earnings of $2 million  on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, wi th no material impact toits Consolidated Statements o
f Operations. See Note 3 for further information regarding the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financialstatements.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02, 
Improvements to Accounting for Costs of Films and Lic ense Agreements for Program Materials, in order to align the accounting for p
roduction costs of an episodic television series with the accounting for production costs of films by removing the content distinction forcapitalization. ASU 2019-02 also r
equires that an entity46

Table of Contentsreassess estimates of 
the use of a film in a film group and account for any changes prospectively. In addition, ASU 2019-02 requires that an entity test films andlicense agreements for program
 material for impairment at a film group level when the film or license agreements are predominantly monetized with other filmsand license agreemen
ts. ASU 2019-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adoptedASU 2019-02 in the first quarter of 2019 and 
as such has included all content assets (licensed and produced) as "Non-current content assets, net" on itsConsolidated Balance Sheets, beginn
ing with the period of adoption. There was no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations. See theCompany's updated Streaming Content pol
icy below for further details.Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) , in order to improve finan cial reporting of expected creditlosses on financial instru
ments and other commitments to extend credit. ASU 2016-13 requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses forfinancial assets held 
at amortized cost and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that requires consideration ofa broader range of infor
mation to estimate credit losses. While the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of ASU 2016-13, it does not expect ASU2016-13 to have a materia
l effect on its financial statements.Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments 
in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90  days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company alsoclassifies amounts in tran
sit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.Streaming Content
The Company acquires, licenses 
and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV series and films.The content licenses ar
e for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require moreupfront cash payments rel
ative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, areclassified within "Net cash us
ed in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The Company recognizes content 
assets (licensed and produced) as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licenses, theCompany capitalizes the 
fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title isknown and the title is accep
ted and available for streaming. For productions, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including developmentcosts, direct costs and produc
tion overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.Based on factors including histo
rical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost ofrevenues” on the Consolidated Sta
tements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years , beginning with the month of firs
t availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance dueto additional merchandisin
g and marketing efforts and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90%  of a licensed orproduced streaming conten
t asset is expected to be amortized within four years  after its month of fi rst availability. The Company reviews factors impacting theamortization of the 
content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.The Company's business model is subscript
ion based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed andproduced) are predominan
tly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates achange in the expected use
fulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event orchanges in circumstanc
es. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value.In addition, unamortized 
costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.Property and Equipment
Property and equipme
nt are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of theestimated useful liv
es of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years , or the expected lease term  for leasehold improvements, if applicable.47

Table of ContentsTrade Receivables
Trade receivables cons
ist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. TheCompany evaluates the need fo
r an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, andexternal market factors.
Revenue Recognition
The Company's primary source of r
evenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership andrevenues are recognized ratabl
y over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted togovernmental authorit
ies. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (“CE”) manufacturers, multichannelvideo programming distribu
tors (“MVPDs”), mobile operators and internet service providers (“ISPs”), provide access to the service as the Company retains controlover service delivery 
to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed, but in the case where the price that themember pays is establish
ed by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as areduction of revenues.

The Company records a provision for 
income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liabilitymethod. Deferred income ta
xes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statementcarrying amounts of exist
ing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferredtax assets and liabili
ties of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets isreduced, if necessary, by a v
aluation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.The Company did not recognize ce
rtain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a taxbenefit only if it is mo
re likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.The tax benefits recogni
zed in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%  likelihood ofbeing realized upon sett
lement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 8 to theconsolidated financial statement
s for further information regarding income taxes.49

Table of ContentsForeign Currency
The functional currency 
for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. TheCompany translates the asse
ts and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end ofeach period. Revenues and expenses 
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from thesetranslations are re
cognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.
The Company remeasure
s monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of eachperiod. Gains and losses from thes
e remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of $7 million
 for the year ended December 31, 2019 , and in a loss of $1 million  and $128 million  for the years ended December 31, 2018  and 2017 , respectively. Earnings Per Share
 Basic earnings per share is 
computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings pershare is computed using the weigh
ted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during theperiod. Potential common sha
res consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is asfollows:

Leases
The
 Company has entered into operating leases primarily for real estate. These leases generally have terms which range from 1  year to 15  years, and ofteninclude
 one  or  more  options  to  renew.  These  renewal  terms  can  extend  the  lease  term  from 1  year to 15  years,  and  are  included  in  the  lease  term  when  it  isreasonably
 certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company's December 31, 2019
 Consolidated  Balance Sheets, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make leasepayments
 are included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company's December  31, 2019 Consolidated  BalanceSheets.
  Based on the present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease term of the Company's existing leases, the Company recognized right-of-useassets of approximately 
$743 million  and lease liabilit ies for operating leases of approximately $813 million  on January 1, 2019. Operating lease r ight-of-use assetsand
 liabilities commencing after January 1, 2019 are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As ofDecember 31, 2019
,  total right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities were approximately $1,532 million  and $1,613 million ,  respectively. The Company hasentered
 into various short-term operating leases, primarily for marketing billboards, with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded onthe
 Company's  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  All  operating  lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease  term.  For  the  year  endedDecember
 31, 2019,  the Company recognized approximately $448 million  in  total lease costs, which was comprised of $218 million  in  operating lease costs forright-of-use assets and 
$230 million  in short-term lease costs related to short-term operating leases.Prior
 to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm.
 The  Company  used  the  date  of  initial  possession  to  begin  amortization,  which  is  generally  when  the  Company  entered  the  space  and  began  to  makeimprovements
 in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other thanthe
 date of initial occupancy, the Company recorded minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statementsof
 Operations. Rent expense associated with operating leases was $107 million  and $75 million  for  the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017,respectively.
Because
 the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of thelease
 payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate and marketing which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treatas a single lease componen
t.Information related to the 
Company's right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities were as follows:

 and December 31, 2018 , the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.Revolving Credit Facility
In 
July 2017, the Company entered into a $500 million  unsecured revolving credi t facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), with an uncommittedincremental facility to increase the am
ount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $250 million , subject to certain t erms and conditions. On March29, 2019, the agreement was amend
ed to extend the maturity date from July 27, 2022 to March 29, 2024 and to increase the size of the credit facility to $750 million
, without impacting the exis ting uncommitted incremental facility. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until March 29, 2024, atwhich time all amounts bor
rowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for workingcapital and general 
corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019 , no amounts have been borrowed under th e Revolving Credit Agreement.The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agr
eement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “AlternateBase Rate”) or (ii) a r
ate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of 0.75% . The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of
 (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate,plus 
0.500%  and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one- month interest period, plus 1.00% . The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered ratefor deposits in U.S. dollars, for the 
relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be lessthan 
0.00%  per annum. Regulatory authori ties that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of 2021, they would no longer compel bankscurrently reporting in
formation used to set the LIBO Rate to continue to make rate submissions. As a result, it is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Ratewill no longer be availabl
e as a reference rate. Under the terms of the Company's Revolving Credit Agreement, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBORate, a mutually agreed
-upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate. The Company and Lenders shall in good faith establish analternate benchma
rk rate which places the Lenders and the Company in the same economic position that existed immediately prior to the discontinuation of theLIBO Rate. The Company does not anticipat
e that the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate will materially impact its liquidity or financial position.The Company is also obligated to pay 
a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of 0.10% . The Revolving Credit Agreement requ
ires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’ssubsidiaries to incur debt 
and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in thecase of the Company or a guaran
tor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of theCompany and its subsidiaries, tak
en as a whole. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.5.

agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at thetime the Company enters in
to an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated BalanceSheets. Certain agreemen
ts include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable asof the reporting date. Tr
aditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples ofsuch license agreemen
ts. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, theunknown obligations are expected 
to be significant.Legal Proceedings
From time to time, in th
e normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employeerelations, business pract
ices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complexlegal proceedings are d
ifficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. TheCompany expenses legal fees as 
incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and theamount of the loss can be re
asonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operationsor its financial posit
ion, liquidity or results of operations.The Company is involved in litiga
tion matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at thistime. The Company's view of the ma
tters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.6.
Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations In the ordinary course of busin
ess, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varyingscope and terms to business par
tners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach ofsuch agreements and o
ut of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other partymaking a claim pursuant t
o the procedures specified in the particular contract.The Company’s obligations under thes
e agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourseagainst third parties 
for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers thatwill require it, among oth
er things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The termsof such obligations vary.
It is not possible to make a 
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to theconditional nature of th
e Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in theaccompanying consolidate
d financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.57

ct on provision (in thousands) 90,856  67,575  61,842 The Company considers several f
actors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior.The Company calculates expe
cted volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in itscommon stock is more ref
lective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicatorof expected volatili
ty than historical volatility of its common stock.In valuing shares issued under th
e Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-couponissues with terms simila
r to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and thereforeuses an expected dividend yie
ld of zero  in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upongrant date.

aspects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additional guidance provided in these regulations resulted in a tax adjustment in the fourthquarter of 2019. We paid U.S. Federal

and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities”in the Consolidated Balance Shee
ts. Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.The Company files U.S. Federal, state 
and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for 2016, 2017, and 2018. The 2009through 2018 state tax returns 
are subject to examination by state tax authorities. The Company is also currently under examination in the UK for 2018. Thecompany has no other signific
ant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2014 through 2018 remain subject to examination by foreign tax authorities.Given the potential outcom
e of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute oflimitations, it is r
easonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimateof the range of reasonably poss
ible adjustments cannot be made at this time.9.
Employee Benefit Plan The Company maintains a 401(k) sav
ings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80%  of their annualsalary through payroll deduc
tions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at thediscretion of the Board. During 
2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company’s matching contr ibutions totaled $47 million , $27 million and $20 million , respectively. 10.
Segment and Geographic Information Effective in the four
th quarter of 2019, the Company operates as one operating segment. The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is itschief executive off
icer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financialperformance and allo
cating resources.Historically, the Company repo
rted contribution profit (loss) for three  segments: Domestic stre aming, International streaming and Domestic DVD, whichwas reflective of how the Company
’s CODM reviewed financial information for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance andallocating resources. Be
cause the Company increasingly obtains multi-territory or global rights for streaming content, contribution profit (loss) on a regional basisis no longer a meaningful m
etric reviewed by the CODM or used in the allocation of resources. Instead, the CODM now focuses on the Company's globaloperating margin as the p
rimary measure of profitability and basis for allocation of resources.Total U.S. revenues were 
$9.5 billion , $8.0 billion and $6.6 billion  for the years ended Decemb er 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 1 Revenue Recognition
 for additional inform ation about streaming revenue by region.The Company's long-lived tangible

EXHIBIT 4.17DESCRIPTION OF THE
 REGISTRANT'S SECURITIESREGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION
 12 OF THESECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
 1934The following description sets 
forth certain material terms and provisions of the securities of Netflix, Inc. (the “Company”) that are registered underSection 12 of the Securities Ex
change Act of 1934, as amended. This description also summarizes relevant provisions of Delaware law. The following summarydoes not purport to be complet
e and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the applicable provisions of Delaware law and our certificate ofincorporation and our bylaws, copi
es of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.17 is a part.We encourage you to read our 
certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and the applicable provisions of Delaware law for additional information.Our certificate of 
incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 4,990,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares ofpreferred stock, par va
lue $0.001 per share, in one or more series.Holders of our common stock are 
entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. Subject to the preferences that may beapplicable to any outstand
ing shares of preferred stock, common stockholders are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time totime by our board of direc
tors out of funds legally available for that purpose. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the common stockholdersare entitled to shar
e ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of any shares of preferred stock then outstanding.Common stockholders have no preemp
tive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to thecommon stock. The common stock cu
rrently outstanding is fully paid and nonassessable.The transfer agent and r
egistrar for the common stock is Computershare Trust Company.Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Sto
ck Market LLC under the trading symbol “NFLX.”Our board of directors is autho
rized, without any action by the stockholders, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, to designate and issue preferredstock in one or more series 
and to designate the powers, preferences and rights of each series, which may be greater than the rights of the common stock. It is notpossible to state the ac
tual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock upon the rights of holders of the common stock until our board of directorsdetermines the speci
fic rights of the holders of such preferred stock. However, the effects might include, among other things:•
impairing the dividend rights of the common stock;•
diluting the voting power of the common stock;•
impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock; and•
delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.Anti-Takeover Provisions
Certain provisions of Delaware 
law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make the following more difficult:•
our acquisition by means of a tender offer;•
acquisition of control by means of a proxy contest or otherwise; and•
removal of our incumbent officers and directors.These provisions, summarized b
elow, are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids, and aredesigned to encourage persons se
eking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with the board of directors. The Company believes that the benefits ofincreased protection 
against an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure the Company outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging suchproposals. Among other things, negotia
tion of such proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.    

Delaware Anti-Takeover Law. Delaware corporations may elect not to be governed by Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (the“DGCL”), 
i.e ., Delaware’s anti-takeover law. The Company has not made this election. Delaware’s anti-takeover law provides that an “interested stockholder,”defined as a person who owns 15% or more of 
the outstanding voting stock of a corporation or a person who is an associate or affiliate of the corporation and,within the preceding thre
e-year period, owned 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock, may not engage in specified business combinations with thecorporation for a period o
f three years after the date on which the person became an interested stockholder. The law defines the term “business combination” toencompass a wide variety of 
transactions with or caused by an interested stockholder, including mergers, asset sales and transactions in which the interestedstockholder receives or 
could receive a benefit on other than a pro rata basis with other shareholders. With the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of thevoting power of all then-outst
anding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, we may amend itsCertificate of Inco
rporation in the future to no longer be governed by the anti-takeover law. This amendment would have the effect of allowing any person whoowns at least 15% of our outstanding vo
ting stock to pursue a takeover transaction that was not approved by our board of directors. However, because theCompany has not elected to opt-ou
t of this provision, for transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, the provision might discourage takeoverattempts that might 
result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.Limitations of Director Liabil
ity and Indemnification. Our certificate of incorporation provides that directors shall not be personally liable to thecorporation or to its shar
eholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitationthereof is not permit
ted under the DGCL. Delaware law currently provides that this waiver may not apply to liability:•
for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders;•
for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;•
under Section 174 of the DGCL (governing distributions to shareholders); or•
for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit.In the event the D
GCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of ourdirectors will be eli
minated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Our bylaws further provide that we will indemnify each of ourdirectors and office
rs, trustees, fiduciaries, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.Election and Removal of Directors.
 Our board of directors is divid ed into three classes of directors, each serving staggered three-year terms. As a result,only a portion of the board of di
rectors will be elected each year. Directors elected at any annual meeting of stockholders will serve three-year terms, unless suchdirector resigns or is 
otherwise removed from the board of directors in accordance with our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law. Our certificate ofincorporation provides tha
t a director can only be removed from the board of directors for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding two-thirds of the outstanding voting powe
r of all classes of stock entitled to vote in an election of directors, voting together as a single class. The board of directors hasthe exclusive right to in
crease or decrease the size of the board and to fill vacancies on the board. These provisions may tend to discourage a third party frommaking a tender offer o
r otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company because they generally make it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majorityof the directors.
Stockholder Meetings. 
Under our certificate of inc orporation, only our chairman of the board, chief executive officer, president or board of directors maycall a special me
eting of stockholders pursuant to a resolution adopted by at least a majority of the total number of authorized directors.Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockhold
er Nominations and Proposals. Our bylaws contain advance notic e procedures with respect tostockholder proposals and the nom
ination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or acommittee of the boa
rd of directors.Elimination of Stockholder Action by Written Consent. 
Our certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of stockholders to act by written consentwithout a meeting. This provision wi
ll make it more difficult for stockholders to take action opposed by the board of directors.No Cumulative Voting
. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which, under Delaware law,precludes stockholders fro
m cumulating their votes in the election of directors, frustrating the ability of minority stockholders to obtain representation on the boardof directors.

Undesignated Preferred Stock. The authorization of undesign ated preferred stock makes it possible for the board of directors, without stockholderapproval, to issue prefer
red stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to obtain control of the Company. Theseand other provisions may have th
e effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in the control or management of the Company.Amendment of Provisions in the Certificat
e of Incorporation. Our certificate of incorporati on requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting powe
r of our stock to amend or repeal any provision of the certificate of incorporation concerning the:•
absence of the necessity of the directors to be elected by written ballot;•
management of the business of the Company by the board of directors;•
absence of the authority of stockholders to act by written consent;•
authority to call a special meeting of stockholders;•
number of directors and structure of the board of directors;•
removal of directors and the filling of vacancies on the board of directors;•
authority of the bylaws to govern advance notice provisions with respect to nominations by stockholders for the election of directors and otherbusiness to be brought before any m
eeting of stockholders;•
the method of amending and authority to amend the bylaws and certificate of incorporation of the Company;•
personal liability of directors to the Company and the stockholders;•
indemnification of the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company; and•
authority or vote required to amend or repeal the section of the certificate of incorporation providing for the right to amend or repeal provisionsof the certifica
te of incorporation.Amendment of Provisions in the Bylaws.
 The certificate of incorporatio n requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of theoutstanding voting power of our stock to 
amend any provision of the bylaws concerning:•
meetings of or actions taken by stockholders;•
number of directors and their term of office;•
election and qualification of directors;•
removal of directors and the filling of vacancies on the board of directors;•
indemnification of the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company; and•
amendments to the bylaws.
