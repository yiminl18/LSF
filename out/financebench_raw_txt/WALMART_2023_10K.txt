ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help people around the world save
money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other
service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail
stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 240 million customers who visit more than 10,500
stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 20 countries.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive
advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as
well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment
of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so
our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so
our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United
States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as
of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022") and January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021"). During fiscal 2023,
we generated total revenues of $611.3 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $605.9 billion.
We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."
The Development of Our Company
The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946,
his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety
stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In
1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2023, our Walmart International segment
conducted business in 19 countries.
In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to
grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up
merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,100 pickup and approximately 7,000 delivery locations globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested
in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, which has enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand
our assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart
Private Limited ("Flipkart"), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra, as well as with our majority stake in
PhonePe Private Limited ("PhonePe"), a digital transaction platform.
We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and marketplaces as well as our supply
chain combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2023 to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a
flywheel effect which creates relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates
several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy globally, our
flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart Fulfillment Services, providing access to quality,
affordable healthcare via Walmart Health and Flipkart Health+, and our financial services businesses. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of
our flywheel centered around our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.

Information About Our Segments
We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America,
Chile, China, India and Mexico. We also previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United
Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on these divestitures. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are
further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent
contribution rate to the Company's net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to the
exit of certain markets and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained
in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Walmart U.S. Segment
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass
merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart" and "Walmart Neighborhood Market" brands, as well as walmart.com and other
eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $420.6 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 69% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had net sales
of $393.2 billion and $370.0 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as
a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and
operating income.
Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as pickup
and delivery, in-home delivery, ship-from-store, and digital pharmacy fulfillment options. As of January 31, 2023, we had more than 4,600 pickup locations
and more than 3,900 same-day delivery locations. Our Walmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits including unlimited
free shipping on eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, access to Paramount+ streaming service, and mobile scan
& go for a streamlined in-store shopping experience. We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of which is walmart.com. We define eCommerce sales
as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores,
as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. The following table
provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2023:

Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:
•Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli & bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and
nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;
•General merchandise includes:
◦Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and books);
◦Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);
◦Apparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and
◦Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home furnishings, home decor, fabrics and
crafts).
•Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other clinical services.
Other categories in the Walmart U.S. business include an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online
marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and newer initiatives such as B2B last mile delivery services via Walmart GoLocal, and a suite of data
products for merchants and suppliers via Walmart Luminate. Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including
through our digital channels, stores and our fintech venture, ONE), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and
certain types of installment lending.(1)

Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private
brands, including brands such as: "Allswell," "Athletic Works," "Eloquii Elements," "Equate," "Free Assembly," "Freshness Guaranteed," "George," "Great
Value," "Holiday Time," "Hyper Tough," "Mainstays," "Marketside," "No Boundaries," "onn.," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice," "Sam's Choice," "Scoop,"
"Spring Valley," "Time and Tru," "Way to Celebrate" and "Wonder Nation." The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of
which include: "Avia," "Love & Sports," "Better Homes & Gardens," "Pioneer Woman" and "Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara."
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous
periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.
Operations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile
application 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help
stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-
channel shopping experiences.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as
different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale
grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, social commerce platforms, as well as companies
that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly
competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our
competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms
from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-
based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.
Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive
position within the retail industry. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection
availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the
attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital
platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet
competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:
•EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent
promotional activity;
•EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;
•Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve
customers in the ways they want to be served; and
•Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and
financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet expanding needs.
Distribution. We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 163 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the
U.S. For fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store
merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the
segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise
purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 34 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment
centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more than 3,900 stores.
8
Walmart International Segment
Walmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 19 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2023. Walmart International operates
through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Walmart International previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021
and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.
Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including:
supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx,
walmart.ca, flipkart.com, walmart.cn and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 17% of our fiscal 2023
consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $101.0 billion and $121.4 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gross profit rate is lower than that of
Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix.
Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of
the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term,
sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which
include the following highlights over the last three years:
•Divested of Walmart Argentina in November 2020.
•Divested of Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.
•Divested of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.
•Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited operations in certain countries in Africa
in December 2022.
•Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital transaction platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in December 2022.
Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and
delivery services in most of our markets and our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India. Our financial services offerings continue to expand with our digital
transaction platform anchored in payments at PhonePe in India. We have expanded our marketplace in Mexico and Canada, which unlocks fulfillment and
advertising services, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia continue to drive ecommerce growth.
Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from
24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2023, Walmart International had over 2,900 pickup and approximately 2,500 delivery locations.
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of
merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed
market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate,"
"George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands
including "Aurrera," "Lider," and "PhonePe." In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each
market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.
Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment
services, healthcare and financial services. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe
business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance
solutions, financial services and advertising. In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service allowing customers to enjoy digital
connectivity, and in India we launched Flipkart Health+ enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. Combined, these offerings did not
represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon
local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and
services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping
experiences.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the
fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well
as different weather patterns.
Competition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety
and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash &
carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment services, health
and wellness, and financial services. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience
largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to
focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our
competitive position in the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the
entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more
customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater
resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better
able to innovate and compete with us.
Distribution. We utilize a total of 188 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. Through these
facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2023, the
majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases
directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution
and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce
platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 100 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 3,600 eCommerce sort
centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as well as our physical retail stores.
Sam's Club Segment
Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club
had net sales of $84.3 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 14% of our consolidated fiscal 2023 net sales, and had net sales of $73.6 billion and $63.9 billion for
fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.
Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.
Membership. The following two options are available to members:
Plus Membership Club Membership
Annual Membership Fee $110 $50
Number of Add-on Memberships ($45 each) Up to 16 Up to 8
All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are also eligible for free shipping on the majority of merchandise, with
no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses. Beginning in fiscal 2023, Sam's Club launched a single loyalty rewards currency
called Sam's Cash which merges and replaces existing Cash Rewards for Plus members and Cash Back for Sam's Club Mastercard holders. Members may
redeem Sam's Cash on purchases in the club and online, to pay for membership fees or for cash in clubs. Sam's Cash does not expire and is available for
monthly redemption.
Omni-channel. Sam's Club provides an omni-channel experience to members, integrating warehouse clubs and eCommerce through such services as Curbside
Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, ship-from-club, and delivery-from-club. Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, including those
not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications. The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000
and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet.
Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:
•Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages,
floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other
consumable items;
•Fuel, tobacco and other categories;
10
•Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power equipment, housewares, toys,
seasonal items, mattresses, and tire and battery centers;
•Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs; and
•Technology, office and entertainment includes consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office supplies, appliances, and third-
party gift cards.
Within the categories above, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand its assortment and deliver member value.
Operations. Sam's Club is available to members through warehouse club locations, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Club
locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before regular operating hours. Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools
to drive a great member experience. Curbside Pickup is available at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club also
offers "Scan & Go," a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as
different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and
wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog
businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club
members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.
Distribution. We utilize 29 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S. segment's
distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. During fiscal 2023, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were
shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers. Sam's Club ships merchandise
purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 13
dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport perishable and non-perishable merchandise from distribution
facilities to clubs.
Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual
property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret
protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of
U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering
certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third
parties.
11
Suppliers and Supply Chain
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the
merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which
such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category. Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to
efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-
effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to
standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire
from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our
supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port
access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and
members.
Government Regulation
As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and
regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "Item 1A. Risk
Factors" under the sub-caption "Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks."
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Priorities
Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create competitive advantage for the
Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe that
addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing
cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems on which Walmart and our stakeholders rely.
We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in relevance to our business and
stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity,
sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity.
•Opportunity. Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, and create
opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human Capital Management section below), our suppliers and workers in supply
chains, and the communities in which we operate. Doing so helps us fulfill our customer mission, strengthens our business and helps people build a
better life for themselves and their families.
•Sustainability. Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value for both people and planet. With respect to
people, our sustainability efforts include sourcing responsibly, helping prevent forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic
opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With respect to the planet, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by
reducing emissions, protecting and restoring nature, and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set science-based
targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040—without offsets—and to reduce or avoid one
billion metric tons of emissions in our value chain by 2030 under our Project Gigaton™ initiative.
•Community. Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by operating our business in a way that meets the needs of our customer and
community stakeholder groups, including by providing safer, healthier and more affordable food and other products, disaster support, associate
volunteerism, local grant programs and community cohesion initiatives.
•Ethics and Integrity. At every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires trust among our associates, with our customers, and in
the communities we serve.
We periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and may update those disclosures from time to
time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report
on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Human Capital Management
At Walmart, we're committed to help people save money and live better around the world. This mission is delivered by our associates who make the difference
for our millions of customers and members every day. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we
12
employed approximately 2.1 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and approximately 0.5 million associates
internationally. In the U.S., approximately 93% of our associates are hourly and approximately 70% of our associates are full-time.
We know the success and progress we've seen this year and throughout our Company's history is because of our associates who work every day to fulfill our
mission. That's why we're focused on providing opportunities for associates to grow and learn. For some, we are a foundational entry point to develop critical
skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, and for others a place where associates can grow their careers across our global omni-channel business. No
matter the role or location, we're focused on developing, rewarding, and retaining associates in an ever-changing environment. As customer expectations and
technology change the nature of work, we know it's our people – our humanity – that will differentiate us from the competition, so this must be a top priority.
Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: belonging, well-being, growth and digital.
Belonging - Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions matter. We are focused on having
an inclusive culture where everyone feels they belong. We publish our diversity representation twice yearly, and hold ourselves accountable to providing
recurring culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including our President and CEO, and members of the Board of Directors. Of the
approximately 2.1 million associates employed worldwide, 52% identify as women. In the U.S., 50% of the approximately 1.6 million associates identify as
people of color.
We review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices. We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded
based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance, and the work they do.
To build a company where associates feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates' feedback in a variety of ways, including but not
limited to our annual associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions. Management reviews the results of feedback obtained
from our formal associate engagement survey.
Well-being - Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates. We invest in our associates by offering competitive wages, as well
as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our
full-time and eligible part-time associates as well as company paid benefits such as 401(k) match, family building support, maternity leave, a paid parental
leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral and mental health services, and a store
discount card or Sam's Club membership. Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, including wage structure and pay, can be
found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available on our corporate website. Nothing on our website, including our ESG
reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into
any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates
is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with new skills. We are invested in the
growth of our associates in support of our business and their success by offering good jobs that lead to great careers and better lives. We launched the global
Walmart Academy to help associates build and grow their careers, creating one of the largest learning ecosystems in the world. The global Walmart Academy
offers training for on-the-job retail skills, leadership courses, and well-being training, serving associates through combination of digital and in-person offerings.
The global focus builds on moving much more to a learning in the flow of work approach.
We also provide access to educational opportunities for our part-time and full-time frontline eligible associates in the U.S. through our Live Better U program,
which provides access to earn a high school diploma or a college degree. Walmart pays 100% of associates' college tuition, books and fees. Our Live Better U
program aligns education offerings with Walmart's own areas of growth, providing opportunities for associates to become great at the job they have today and
prepare for the job of tomorrow. Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions. Our
focus on providing a path of opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and benefits, and career advancement creates a strong
associate value proposition and strengthens our workforce.
Digital - Accelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience and drive business results. To deliver a seamless customer
and associate experience, we continue to invest in digital tools like Me@Walmart, MyClub and Me@Campus to improve associate productivity, engagement,
and performance. The MyFeedback app was developed to capture real-time associate feedback. Walmart supports associates who are on the U.S. Medical Plan
with free virtual visits which include visits for medical doctor urgent care, along with mental health care with psychiatrist and psychologists.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial position and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and
globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face.
Strategic Risks
Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely
affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.
The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures
with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.
Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other
customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our
overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this
strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected
ecosystem for our customers that deepens and maintains our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our
overall enterprise strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A. With the interconnected components of
this enterprise strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or member perceptions about our
reputation or our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial
performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce
sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the
opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially
adversely affect our financial performance.
Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our
financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer
term.
If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,
demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success
of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing
products and services and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and
cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media
available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer
tastes, preferences (including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to
changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the
products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business.
We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers, and other businesses which could materially
adversely affect our financial performance.
Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many
other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail
intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. The
omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive
15
pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,
location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital
platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel
integration of our physical and digital operations.
A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omni-
channel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
See "Item 1. Business" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.
Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other
factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems, or reductions in operations may result in
competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their
competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive
prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.
General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.
Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and
other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of
unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and
shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws,
other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall
economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer
demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin,
cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of
inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or
other long-lived assets.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare
costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of
sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the
goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.
The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our
financial performance.
We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our
business. These arrangements (such as ONE, our fintech joint venture, and our healthcare initiative with UnitedHealth Group) may not generate the level of
sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we
could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or in
certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
16
Operational Risks
Global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, including COVID-19, could negatively impact our business, financial position and results of
operations.
The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics or epidemics are uncertain and difficult to predict. A pandemic, such as
COVID-19, or other epidemic could impact our business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access
to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the spread of a virus or other disease (such as travel bans and
restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future
performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. Customer behaviors changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-
19 pandemic. In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent, customer demand for
certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that
demand. These factors may result in higher demand for certain products and less demand for others, as well as out-of-stock positions in certain products, along
with delays in delivering those products (due to supply chain and transportation issues) and could impact inventory levels in the future. Other factors and
uncertainties may include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the
number of cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs; evolving
macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business
performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the effectiveness and
extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments, including for any variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-
term impact of the pandemic or epidemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could
otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.
To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, or a future pandemic or epidemic occurs, such
events may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition,
our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions,
labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.
Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics, catastrophic and other events could materially adversely
affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather
conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical tensions or events;
regional or global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (such as COVID-19); and catastrophic and other events, such as war, civil
unrest (including theft, looting or vandalism), terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in
our U.S. stores), or the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located, or in other areas of
the world (such as in Ukraine where a war currently exists between Ukraine and Russia) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.
Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution
or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to
reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and
distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers
(including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement
limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the
disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a
country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either
reduced availability or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply, or otherwise), the disruption (whether
directly or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and our facilities, and the
disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities.
Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or
transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk may include:
temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the
production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather
17
events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts
may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic
conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory
requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.
We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; theft, loss or
spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our
operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial
and operational performance. Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely
affect our financial and operational performance.
Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important
factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws,
and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a
timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced
outside the U.S.
Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are
located (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards
(including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to
suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores,
clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets
in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the
countries in which they are located are beyond our control (such as, for example, the factors that occurred with respect to the availability of supply for baby
formula during the prior fiscal year).
In addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs and other restrictions on the exportation and importation of goods, trade sanctions imposed between
certain countries and entities, the limitation on the exportation or importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other
countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could
adversely affect our operations and financial performance.
If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries
suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial
performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers
or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food
and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to
reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we
sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital
platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions, including, but not limited to, intellectual
property and products liability laws, apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes or interpretations could expose us to liability, loss of sales,
reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for
third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of
others. Although we have marketplace compliance controls and impose contractual terms on sellers to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be
able to detect certain prohibited items, enforce such terms, or collect sufficient damages for breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact
on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and enterprise strategy.
18
We rely extensively on information and financial systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our
systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information
systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses,
worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security incidents and breaches (including through cyberattacks, which may be from
cybercriminals or sophisticated state-sponsored threat actors), catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes and
hurricanes, usage errors by our associates or contractors, civil or political unrest, or armed hostilities. Our information systems are essential to our business
operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online
operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are
damaged, breached, attacked, interrupted, or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and
may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information
systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware,
software, processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely or successfully
integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these
initiatives. For example, during the first quarter of fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, we initiated an upgrade to our existing financial system, including our
general ledger and other applications. If we are unable to implement this upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
could be adversely affected; our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed; and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online and enable us to deliver products and services do not
function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social
media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales
strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the
customer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a
rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world, and we continue to make investments in supply chain automation to support
our omni-channel strategy. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in
our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment.
Moreover, some of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by third-party service providers. To the extent
either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function as anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology or a
faulty implementation, such failure can significantly interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing expectations. Any disruption or failure on our
part to provide attractive, user-friendly, and secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise and services at competitive prices and with
low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform
merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient manner could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales,
harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on
our business and results of operations.
Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run,
including those applications and systems used in our acquired eCommerce, technology or other businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks
involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and
misuse customers' or members' information including personal information and/or payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Such
attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more
of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our
ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable
parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for
any damage to customers, members or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a
material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.
19
Any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates, business partners and
vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal
actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business
and operating results.
Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information and/or payment information about our customers and members, and
we also receive and store information concerning our associates and vendors. In addition, our health and wellness business operations, the Walmart Health
locations, and third-party service providers who handle information on our behalf, store and maintain personal health information. Some of this information is
stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms and technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses. We utilize third-party
service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office
support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors.
In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information
permitting cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming
increasingly sophisticated and frequent. Attacks against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of our third-party service providers, create
risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware, or phishing incidents. We expect to continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future.
Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of
motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by
perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or
disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and
disruptions. Mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us. The increased use of remote
work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party service providers' systems have
experienced security incidents or breaches and although they have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a
similar result in the future.
Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or
our third-party service providers' security measures and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or
applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or
used in a manner that could compromise information security.
Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed,
obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions
(including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or "HIPAA"), customer attrition,
remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which
could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized
access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to
anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security event,
breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack,
ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other
compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, members, financial institutions, regulatory authorities,
payment card networks and others.
Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems
caused by security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks, or
utility companies) – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service
providers, customers, members, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis.
Our reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy, which combines traditional retail, membership models,
marketplaces, financial services, healthcare, and other customer and business services into a series of interconnected assets to make it seamless for customers to
interact with us. Security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members,
associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material
reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting
20
our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of
confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the
imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event
could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to
upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise
compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards, mobile payments, and
our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a
retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network
security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all
of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, breaches, or other compromises
from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future. In certain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors
and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which
could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is
compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.
Additionally, through various financial service partners and our ONE fintech joint venture, we offer various services such as money transfers, digital payment
platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards, installment lending, and earned wage access. These products
and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including privacy, authentication and tokenization, global anti-money laundering and
sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and
regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.
The Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and
transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches. Among other obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under
international, federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, government agencies and the media. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data
breach could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation.
Changes in type or scope of offerings of our health and wellness business or the Walmart Health business could adversely affect our overall results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments across the U.S. and in various of our international markets such as
Canada and Mexico. We also provide management services to Walmart Health centers that offer medical, dental, behavioral health and other health services in
a number of states, as well as a national telehealth service provider. In addition, Walmart's 10-year collaboration with UnitedHealth Group includes agreements
for Walmart Health to provide value-based care to patients in certain areas of the U.S., among other initiatives.
A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual
relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").
Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix
(i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable
reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise
receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and
preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic
prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new
brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which
there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands
and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs;
increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options and/or home delivery options;
further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our
pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or
incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and
PBMs related to the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any
21
additional changes in the state or federal regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of
health reform efforts, and other changes to or novel interpretations of existing state or federal laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy
business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be
severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and
result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.
Walmart Health clinical operations are also subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for
services; changes in our payer mix; changes in the health insurance market generally; our inability to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-
party payers, including managed care plans; competition for patients from other healthcare providers, including those that offer telehealth services; changes to
healthcare provider utilization practices and treatment methodologies; trends toward value-based purchasing and price transparency; overall economic
conditions and the ability of patients to pay for services; staffing challenges, including retention of a sufficient number and quality of healthcare professionals;
compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry; changes in laws and regulations, including as a result of
health reform efforts; and healthcare technology initiatives, including those related to patient data and interoperability; and public health conditions.
One or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated
with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling
opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the type, volume and mix of services we provide, the reimbursement we receive for
health and wellness services rendered, and the scope and pace of expansion of Walmart Health and related offerings. Any of these developments could, in turn,
adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially
adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates
globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs,
distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external
factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within
those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and
regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within the
Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and
non-retail businesses, including, for example, technology, health and wellness, and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and
motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior management and executive levels, could result in
increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage
leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised, or novel interpretations of existing labor laws, rules or regulations
or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
Financial Risks
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these
expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, capital expenditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates,
eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in
our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities
analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.
22
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are
denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and
expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in
currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated
Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in
our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange
rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our
reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which
the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner
unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase
in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue
to adversely affect our results of operations.
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to
the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.
During fiscal 2023, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 17% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in
various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety
of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic
conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership
restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures or
nationalization), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition investigations currently underway in Mexico related to our
subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary),
local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, foreign exchange or
currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate,
now or in the future.
The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if
they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade,
monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar
organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks
inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax
consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the
U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign
jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in
business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other
countries. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure
compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including
those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary,
will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance
23
programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our
business or financial performance and our reputation.
Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
In fiscal 2023, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 83% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and
trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell
in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our
U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of
such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could
materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international operations as well as our business.
We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The
determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income
taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than
anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide
tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles.
We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any
of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S.
corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates
will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance, and
interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur
additional costs and could affect our results of operations.
In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to or seek to enforce novel interpretations of their
tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. For example, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (the "OECD"), the European Union and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting
substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD's Pillar Two
initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis and for which many jurisdictions have now committed to an effective
enactment date starting January 1, 2024. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and
regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.
Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective
effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from
the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period
or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.
Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations, and interpretations of such laws and regulations specific to the businesses and
jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance.
We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate and could be materially adversely affected by changes to
existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable
regulations. In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere our practices and
procedures to comply with these laws and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges.
Our health and wellness operations in the U.S. and the operations of the Walmart Health locations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and
regulations including, but not limited to, those related to: licensing, reimbursement arrangements, and other requirements and restrictions; registration and
regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; governmental and commercial reimbursement
(including Medicare and Medicaid); data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data, including obligations and restrictions related to
health information (such as those imposed under HIPAA); billing and coding for healthcare services and properly handling overpayments; debt collection;
necessity and adequacy of healthcare services; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients and other fraud and abuse issues, such as those
addressed by anti-kickback and false claims laws and patient inducement regulations; qualification of healthcare practitioners; quality and standards of medical
services and
24
equipment; and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare services, including limitations on the corporate practice
of medicine in certain states.
Health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. For
example, in the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance
and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating
standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding
of controlled substances. The DEA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the
ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition,
there has been recent heightened governmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing, which has resulted in federal and state legislation and
regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to increase transparency in pharmaceutical product pricing and reform government
program reimbursement methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes, among other matters, policies designed to impact drug prices
and reduce drug spending by the federal government). Other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also impact our business or require us to
modify certain aspects of our operations. We may not be able to predict the nature or success of reform initiatives, and the resulting uncertainties may have an
adverse effect on our business.
We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to competition and
antitrust matters; protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous
substances; food and drug safety, including drug supply chain security requirements; trade, consumer protection, and safety, including the availability, sale,
price label accuracy, advertisement, and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels, stores and
clubs as well as our ONE fintech joint venture); anti-money laundering prohibitions; consumer financial protection laws; economic, trade, and other sanctions
matters; licensure, certification, and enrollment with government programs; data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data; working
conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters; and health and wellness related
regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory
requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protections
laws and U.S. sanctions. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and
disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital,
and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report.
Moreover, we are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal
information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), new
comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Connecticut (the Connecticut Data Protection Act), Colorado (the Colorado Privacy Act), Utah (the Utah Privacy
Act) and Virginia (the Consumer Data Protection Act), each of which go into effect in 2023, as well as other laws and regulations such as the Illinois Biometric
Information Privacy Act, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the United Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation
(which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), China's Personal Information Protection Act, and similar legislation in Quebec (An Act to modernize legislative
provisions as regards the protection of personal information, SQ 2021, c 25). The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching, continue to evolve, and may
require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. These and other privacy and
cybersecurity laws may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. For example, in the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the
GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the
greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-
factored approach. Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal
information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. Laws such as those
in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Utah, and Virginia may allow civil penalties for violations, and CCPA and CPRA provide a private right of action
for data breaches. Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone
Consumer Protection Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business.
Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity, impact our reputation and could require
a costly response from and defense by us.
The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny as to
existing laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, in the U.S., shifting enforcement priorities for existing antitrust, competition, and pricing laws, as
well as proposed new rules and regulations) generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related
interpretations and enforcement practices of
25
existing laws and regulations may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant
capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. If
we fail to predict or respond adequately to changes, including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our
competitors, our business, operations, and financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The
regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these risks. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation
of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties
that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required licenses
and certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.;
termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages. Failure to
comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial
exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results of operations.
We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position and liquidity.
We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and
investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities. We
may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities,
derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be
determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain
unresolved for several years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which
the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the
plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.
The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled
substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and also is a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids, including the
consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, healthcare providers
and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict
the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid
matters. In addition, in July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart and other parties requesting the recipients
show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged
violations that related to a period prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The Company can provide no assurance as to the
scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification, and can provide
no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements. The Company is also a defendant in
litigation with the Federal Trade Commission regarding the Company's money transfer agent services and is also cooperating with and responding to subpoenas
issued by the U.S Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the Company's consumer
fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The Company
is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or investigations or any other related actions by governmental entities regarding these matters and can provide
no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially
adversely affected. We discuss in more detail these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and in
Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
26
Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of
actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our
shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,
officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity.
Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or
former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of
Chancery. The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial
forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage
such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of,
the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could
adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our
shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive
federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our ESG goals.
We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in certain ESG priority issue areas.
From time to time, we announce certain aspirations and goals relevant to our priority ESG issues. We periodically publish information about our ESG
priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and update our ESG reporting from time to time. Achievement of these aspirations and goals is
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the
achievement of our ESG goals or that certain of our customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and non-
governmental organizations might not be satisfied with our goals or our efforts toward achieving those goals. Certain challenges we face in the achievement of
our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. A failure or perceived failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or
shareholder support.

We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas, that serve as our principal office and own and lease office facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally
for operations as well as for field and market management. The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. We use
independent contractors to construct our buildings. All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for
additional rent based on sales volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include rent escalation
clauses. For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under "Item 1. Business."

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," which is captioned "Contingencies," under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings." We refer you to that
discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide
the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the
date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.
Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL"). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of March 3, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases
against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of
the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August
17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $651 million over fifteen years, on a joint and
several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary
aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL has designated
five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery. In addition, there are over 300 other cases pending in state and federal courts
throughout the country as of March 3, 2023. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-
K.
Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all
opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on
appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments
against the Company. The settlement will take effect if a sufficient number of political subdivisions also join.
DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of
Justice (the "DOJ") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and
dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22,
2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the
Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending.
Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the
allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former
officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants
breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with
the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed
pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in
the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by
filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint.
The court held a hearing on that motion on September 26, 2022; a ruling remains pending. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired
Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and
appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022,
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017,
through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.
Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of
Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21.

Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 3/5/21,
consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation, USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21.
ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v. ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others – Manchester Employment Tribunal); Abbas & Others v
Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003243); and Abusubih & Others v Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003240).
Money Transfer Agent Services Litigation: Federal Trade Commission v. Walmart Inc. (CV-3372), USDC, N. Dist. Of Ill, 6/28/22.
II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS:
Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of
its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice
requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be
initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in
2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing
to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the
regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the
matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations
vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it
does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that
might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the
Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there
will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements.
III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority
is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold
not to exceed $1 million.
In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding
Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda
County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes the suit is
without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for
penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter and no
assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022") and January 31, 2021
("fiscal 2021"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide
the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period
to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's
performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of
how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole.
Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the
Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time,
we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating
decision maker.
Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores
and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's
definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and
conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel
transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our
Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is
accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses
are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales
are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a
result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries
where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between
current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates.
Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer
to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net
sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.
We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio, primarily in the Walmart International segment, including the following highlights over the
last three years:
•In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a pre-tax non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.0 billion, primarily due to
cumulative foreign currency translation losses. Refer to Note 12.
•In February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021
of $5.5 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 11 and Note 12.
•In March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021
of $1.9 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 12.
•In November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary (Refer to Note 3) and in
December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa.
•In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. Refer to Note 3.
We operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount,
department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services,
advertising, and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-
channel or eCommerce
35
presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a
number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the
COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions
in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and
energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks
and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its
securities can be found herein under "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low
costs. However, like other retail companies, we have seen supply chain disruptions contributing to higher than
normal inventory levels throughout the year. In addition, our merchandise costs for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 have been impacted by high
inflation, greater than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and
merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those
cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food
categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working
with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual
purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and
may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect
on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; supply chain pressures; and ongoing uncertainties related to global health epidemics or pandemics,
any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "Results of Operations" below.
Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our
business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:
•strong, efficient growth;
•consistent operating discipline; and
•strategic capital allocation.
As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.
Strong, Efficient Growth
Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club
sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives that
complement our flywheel strategy. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.
Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs,
including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales
using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in
our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our
fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar.
Calendar comparable sales, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2023 and 2022, were as follows:
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
 2023 2022 2023 2022
 With Fuel Fuel Impact
Walmart U.S. 7.0% 6.4% 0.4% 0.3%
Sam's Club 14.6% 15.0% 4.2% 5.5%
Total U.S. 8.2% 7.7% 1.0% 1.2%
Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 8.2% and 7.7% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 7.0% and 6.4% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. For
36
fiscal 2023, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise
categories, as well as growth in transactions. For fiscal 2022, comparable sales growth was driven driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which
included strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022 as we continue to focus on a
seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.
Comparable sales at Sam's Club increased 14.6% and 15.0% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2023, Sam's Club comparable sales benefited
from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club comparable sales for fiscal
2022 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also included some
higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to
remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.8% and 1.3% to comparable sales for fiscal
2023 and 2022, respectively.
Consistent Operating Discipline
We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest
cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline
through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses.
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022
Net sales $ 605,881 $ 567,762 
Percentage change from comparable period 6.7 % 2.3 %
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 127,140 $ 117,812 
Percentage change from comparable period 7.9 % 1.3 %
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.0 % 20.8 %
For fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a
percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the
reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment. These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and
lower incremental COVID-19 costs.
For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a
percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous
year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment.
Strategic Capital Allocation
Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As
such, we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain, omni-channel initiatives, technology and store remodels and less to new store and club openings.
The following table provides additional detail:
(Amounts in millions) Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2023 2022
Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 9,209 $ 7,197

Total U.S. $ 14,232 $ 10,609 
Walmart International 2,625 2,497 
Total capital expenditures $ 16,857 $ 13,106 
Returns
As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return
on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and
Capital Resources section.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics
37
to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors
because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term
strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 4.6% and 5.6% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due
to the decrease in net income, which was driven by lower operating income, partially offset by lapping debt extinguishment charges. ROI was 12.7% and
14.9% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which was primarily due to a decrease in operating income which included charges associated with opioid-related
legal settlements as well as reorganization and restructuring expenses, all recorded in fiscal 2023.
We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve
months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets,
plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.
Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that
are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization
from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure
computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the
period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and
adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital.
Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to
investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by
management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.
The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate
additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow
should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating
activities as a measure of our liquidity. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating
activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net
cash provided by operating activities of $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We generated free cash flow
of $12.0 billion, $11.1 billion and $25.8 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased
when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and
the timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 2022 due to the increase in operating cash flows described
above, partially offset by an increase of $3.8 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Net cash provided by operating activities for
fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the
impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared
to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.8 billion in increased capital expenditures.
Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the
measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we
believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by
management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe
to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net
cash used in financing activities.

Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $38.5 billion or 6.7% and $13.6 billion or 2.4% for fiscal 2023 and
2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased $38.1
billion or 6.7% and $12.5 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, the increase was
primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which was driven by growth in average ticket, including
strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions, along with positive comparable sales in all
of our international markets. Additionally, net sales were negatively impacted by a decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the
U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2022,
the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club which benefited from strong U.S. consumer spending
and some inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our remaining international markets. The increase was partially offset by a $32.6 billion net
sales decrease primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales also
benefited from a $4.5 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022.
Our gross profit rate decreased 98 and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal
2023, the decrease was primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs and inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's
Club segment. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost inflation as well as
merchandise mix, partially offset by increased supply chain costs.
For fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a
percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the
reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment. These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and
lower incremental COVID-19 costs. For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous
fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5
billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment.
Loss on extinguishment of debt was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the early retirement of certain higher rate long-term debt to reduce interest expense in
future periods.
Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business
dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. Other gains and losses consisted of a net loss of $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion for fiscal
2023 and 2022, respectively. The net loss in fiscal 2023 primarily consists of: (a) net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity and other
investments; (b) a gain of $0.4 billion recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil; and (c) a $0.2 billion dividend from one of
our investments. The net loss in fiscal 2022 primarily consists of net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4
billion in incremental losses associated with the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.(1)

Our effective income tax rate was 33.6% for fiscal 2023, 25.4% for fiscal 2022, and 33.3% for fiscal 2021, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate
for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily due to the tax impact of the business reorganization resulting in the full separation of PhonePe from
Flipkart. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the $8.3 billion loss related to the divestiture of
certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021, which provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate
may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances, changes in tax law,
outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which
are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax
rates for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 is presented in Note 9.
As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $11.3 billion and $13.9 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which
represents a decrease of $2.6 billion and an increase of $0.2 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted
net income per common share attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was $4.27, $4.87 and $4.75 for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Walmart U.S. Segment
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2021
Net sales $ 420,553 $ 393,247 $ 369,963 
Percentage change from comparable period 6.9 % 6.3 % 8.5 %
Calendar comparable sales increase 7.0 % 6.4 % 8.7 %
Operating income $ 20,620 $ 21,587 $ 19,116 
Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.9 % 5.5 % 5.2 %
Unit counts at period end 4,717 4,742 4,743 
Retail square feet at period end 702 703 703 
Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $27.3 billion or 6.9% and $23.3 billion or 6.3% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the
previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 7.0% and 6.4% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Comparable sales in fiscal 2023 were driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise
categories, as well as growth in transactions. Comparable sales in fiscal 2022 were driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which included strong
consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. Walmart U.S.
eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-
channel experience for our customers.
Gross profit rate decreased 85 basis points for fiscal 2023 and increased 51 basis points for fiscal 2022, when compared to the respective previous fiscal year.
The decrease in fiscal 2023 gross profit rate was primarily due to net markdowns and product mix shifts into lower margin categories and increased supply
chain costs, partially offset by price management impacts driven by cost inflation. Gross profit rate for fiscal 2022 benefited from price management driven by
cost inflation as well as merchandise mix, which includes lapping the temporary closures of our Auto Care and Vision Centers and growth in our advertising
business, partially offset by increased supply chain costs.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 25 basis points for fiscal 2023 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily driven
by strong sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by increased wage costs. For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a
percentage of segment net sales increased 31 basis points primarily due to investments in wages, partially offset by lower incremental COVID-19 related costs
of $1.9 billion.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $1.0 billion and increased $2.5 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively,
when compared to the previous fiscal year.

Walmart International Segment
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2021
Net sales $ 100,983 $ 100,959 $ 121,360 
Percentage change from comparable period — % (16.8)% 1.0 %
Operating income $ 2,965 $ 3,758 $ 3,660 
Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.9 % 3.7 % 3.0 %
Unit counts at period end 5,306 5,251 6,101 
Retail square feet at period end 273 277 337 
Net sales for the Walmart International segment were flat and decreased $20.4 billion or 16.8% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the
previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, net sales benefited from positive comparable sales in all of our international markets, offset by the impacts of a decrease of
$5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as well as $3.7 billion of
fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to
the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This decrease was partially offset by positive
comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.5 billion.
Gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points and 55 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal
2023, the decrease was primarily driven by continued growth in lower margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower margin
categories. For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 41 basis points and decreased 71 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when
compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to business
reorganization and restructuring charges incurred related to Flipkart and Massmart during the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily due to
impacts from the divested markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited
from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at
the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $0.8 billion and increased $0.1 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively,
when compared to the previous fiscal year.
Sam's Club Segment
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2021
Including Fuel
Net sales $ 84,345 $ 73,556 $ 63,910 
Percentage change from comparable period 14.7 % 15.1 % 8.7 %
Calendar comparable sales increase 14.6 % 15.0 % 8.7 %
Operating income $ 1,964 $ 2,259 $ 1,906 
Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.3 % 3.1 % 3.0 %
Unit counts at period end 600 600 599

Excluding Fuel 
Net sales $ 71,665 $ 64,860 $ 59,184 
Percentage change from comparable period 10.5 % 9.6 % 12.1 %
Operating income $ 1,352 $ 1,923 $ 1,645 
Operating income as a percentage of net sales 1.9 % 3.0 % 2.8 %
 We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are
impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better
measure underlying operating results in the segment.
Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $10.8 billion or 14.7% and $9.6 billion or 15.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the
previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 14.6%. Comparable sales benefited from
growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively
contributed approximately 0.8% to comparable sales which was primarily driven by ship to home and curbside pickup. For fiscal 2022, the increase was
primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to
increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some(1)

42
higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain
club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales.
Gross profit rate decreased 155 basis points and 68 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal
2023, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to inventory write-downs, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs and inflation related
LIFO charges. For fiscal 2022, gross profit rate decreased primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply
chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales.
Membership and other income increased 7.0% and 13.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023
and 2022, the increase was primarily due to increases in new member sign-ups and Plus member penetration.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 97 basis points and 82 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared
to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2023 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses
as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs,
partially offset by reduced tobacco sales.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $0.3 billion and increased $0.4 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively,
when compared to the previous fiscal year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,
supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that
support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common
stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay
dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 28,841 $ 24,181 $ 36,074 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by
operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory
purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and the timing of certain payments. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for
fiscal 2022, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping
the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit
Cash and cash equivalents were $8.6 billion and $14.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total
current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.5 billion and $6.3 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in our working capital
deficit is primarily driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accrued liabilities. We generally operate with a working capital deficit
due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments
of cash dividends and share repurchases.
We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost
possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S.  Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon
repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may
incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash
amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations.
As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local
laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021
Net cash used in investing activities $ (17,722)$ (6,015)$ (10,071)
Net cash used in investing activities was $17.7 billion, $6.0 billion and $10.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and generally consisted of
capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities increased $11.7 billion for fiscal 2023 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the
result of lapping the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan and an increase in capital expenditures to support our
investment strategy. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.1 billion for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the
net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, partially offset by increased capital expenditures.
Capital expenditures
Refer to the "Strategic Capital Allocation" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2023 and 2022. For the fiscal
year ending January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $17 billion to $18 billion, with a focus on technology,
supply chain, and customer-facing initiatives.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021
Net cash used in financing activities $ (17,039)$ (22,828)$ (16,117)
Net cash from financing activities generally consists of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and transactions with noncontrolling
interest shareholders. Fiscal 2023 net cash used in financing activities decreased $5.8 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease is
primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes in the prior fiscal period, partially
offset by the equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock in the prior fiscal period. Fiscal 2022 net cash used in financing activities increased $6.7 billion
when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment of premiums for the early
extinguishment of certain notes, as well as increased share repurchases, partially offset by long-term debt issuances and equity funding from the sale of
subsidiary stock.
Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stock
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's Massmart
subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership of Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%. Additionally, the Company completed a
$0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity and resulted in the Company becoming a 100%
owner.
During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which
reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75%.
Short-term Borrowings
We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital
expenditures and other cash requirements. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2023,
2022 and 2021:
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021
Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $ 11,432 $ 716 $ 4,048 
Average daily short-term borrowings 7,250 626 1,577 
Annual weighted-average interest rate 2.4 % 3.7 % 3.1 %
Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.4 billion, with weighted-average interest rates of 6.6% and 2.9%, respectively. We also have
$15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. as of January 31, 2023 that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Additionally, we
maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the U.S. to further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed.
As of January 31, 2023, we have $2.1 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available, of which $1.8 billion was drawn and represents an unrecorded
current obligation.

Long-term Debt
The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2023:
(Amounts in millions)Long-term debt due
within one year Long-term debt Total
Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 
Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 5,041 5,041 
Repayments of long-term debt (2,689) — (2,689)
Reclassifications of long-term debt 4,197 (4,197) — 
Currency and other adjustments (120) (1,059) (1,179)
Balances as of January 31, 2023 $ 4,191 $ 34,649 $ 38,840 
Our total outstanding long-term debt increased $1.2 billion during fiscal 2023, primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt in September 2022, partially
offset by the maturities of certain long-term debt. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances of long-term debt.
Estimated contractual interest payments associated with our long-term debt amount to $18.8 billion, with approximately $1.7 billion expected to be paid in
fiscal 2024. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and assumes
interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate instruments.
Dividends
Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion, $6.2 billion and $6.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Effective February 21, 2023, the
Company approved the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share. For fiscal 2024, the
annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:
Record Date Payable Date
March 17, 2023 April 3, 2023
May 5, 2023 May 30, 2023
August 11, 2023 September 5, 2023
December 8, 2023 January 2, 2024
Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.
All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. In November 2022,
the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which, beginning on November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase
program. As of January 31, 2023, authorization for $19.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares
are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,
current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority
of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow.
The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share
repurchases for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021
Total number of shares repurchased 73.9 69.7 19.4
Average price paid per share $ 134.17 $ 140.45 $ 135.20 
Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 9,920 $ 9,787 $ 2,625 
Material Cash Requirements
Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general
operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other
obligations include opioid and other legal settlements, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, purchases of subsidiary
stock and purchase obligations. See Note 3, Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding purchase of subsidiary
stock, outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.
45
As of January 31, 2023, the Company has $33.3 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $11.6 billion is due within one year. Purchase
obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital
expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services
are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be
purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or
a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations
quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding
agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into
contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for
cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services
or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
Capital Resources
We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our
anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital
expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.
We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at
favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2023, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were
as follows:
Rating agency   Commercial paper   Long-term debt
Standard & Poor's   A-1+   AA
Moody's Investors Service   P-1   Aa2
Fitch Ratings   F1+   AA
Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.
Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include
changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and
capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or
impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit
ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us
to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial
paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated
independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex
and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as
reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ
from our estimates.
Management continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements.
Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.

The Walmart U.S. segment comprises the largest portion of our inventory and is primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting to
determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") valuation method. The majority of the Sam's Club segment inventories are accounted for and
valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these
estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. As a measure of sensitivity, an incremental 1% inflationary impact to the cost of our inventory
purchases would not have resulted in a material increase to the LIFO provision recorded during fiscal 2023.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the
intended use of the related asset. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash
flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. Indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative
assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on qualitative factors, that
the fair value of the indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would be
performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market
conditions. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost. Because of the nature of the
factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.
Contingencies
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the
amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is
reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of
47
amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material,
we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether
the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to
predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and have
not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse
effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Taxes
Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the
determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax
laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, increases and decreases in
valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and
international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.
Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions
are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if
any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as
appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of
deductible and taxable items.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many
factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,
expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets
is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted
operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates.
As guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in
accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the
fair values of certain equity and equity method investments measured on a recurring basis.
The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not
represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,
however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by
managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2023, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps
decreased $0.6 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the
principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash
flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash
flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2023.

Weighted-average receive rate 2.6 % 3.3 % — % — % — % 2.5 % 2.7 %
    Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt.
As of January 31, 2023, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 21% of our total short-
term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2023 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to
change by approximately $0.1 billion.
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than the U.S., as well as our foreign-
currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2023, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets
resulted in the $1.1 billion net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $1.4
billion and $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain currencies in fiscal 2023. The hypothetical result of a uniform
10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of
$0.7 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2023 would have resulted in a
change in the value of the swaps of $0.1 billion.
In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments
denominated in non-functional currencies.
Investment Risk
We are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the fair value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments
where we have elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis. These changes in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses and resulted
in a loss of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily due to net decreases in the underlying stock prices of those investments. As of January 31, 2023, the fair value
of our equity investments, including certain equity method investments, measured on a recurring basis was $10.7 billion. As of January 31, 2023, a hypothetical
10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately $1.1 billion.(1)

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to
be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the
Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the
critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Contingencies
Description of the
MatterAs described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2023, the Company is involved in a number of
legal proceedings and regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when
management determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The
Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. In assessing the probability of
occurrence and whether an estimate of loss can be reasonably estimated for a particular legal proceeding, management exercises
judgment on matters relevant to each proceeding, such as whether sufficient participation in settlement proceedings will occur, or
whether it can predict the number of claims that may be filed. For example, management exercised judgment in accruing a liability
for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework and other previously agreed state and tribal settlements regarding
opioid-related lawsuits. Auditing management's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly
judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of
occurrence for contingencies or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made.
51
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and
evaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company's assessment of the likelihood of loss and the
Company's determinations regarding the measurement of loss.
To test the Company's assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among
other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewed
documents provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and outside
legal counsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal and outside legal counsel. As part
of this assessment, we evaluated management's assumptions and calculations by, among other things, comparing those assumptions
to key terms in the Settlement Framework and to payments made during the year. We also assessed the adequacy of the related
disclosures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,
Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on the COSO
criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated March 17, 2023 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Walmart Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help people around the world save money and
live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is
striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves
time for its customers.
The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 ("fiscal
2023"), January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022") and January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021"). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.
Investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted
for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.
The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The
Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during
the month of January 2023 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic
transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions
classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $8.6 billion and $14.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of
January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, approximately 62% and 50% were held outside of the U.S., respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the
U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the
minimum cost possible.
As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the
U.S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.
Receivables
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which includes
pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven
days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2023 and
January 31, 2022, net receivables from transactions with customers were $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.
59
Inventories
The Company utilizes various inventory methods to account for and value its inventories depending upon the nature of the store formats and businesses in each
of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net realizable value, as appropriate.
•Walmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting ("RIM") to determine inventory cost,
using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") valuation method. RIM generally results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent
markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.
•Walmart International Segment – Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted for using either the RIM or
weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method.
•Sam's Club Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method.
For those segments that utilize the LIFO method, the Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or
deflation. These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end for inflation or deflation and inventory levels.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are
capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment
balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:
Estimated Useful Lives As of January 31,
(Dollars in millions) (in Years) 2023 2022
Land N/A $ 19,317 $ 19,204 
Buildings and improvements 3 - 40 104,554 100,376 
Fixtures and equipment 2 - 30 65,235 60,282 
Transportation equipment 3 - 15 2,462 2,263 
Construction in progress N/A 10,802 7,199 
Property and equipment 202,370 189,324 
Accumulated depreciation (101,610) (94,809)
Property and equipment, net $ 100,760 $ 94,515 
Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total
depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was
$10.9 billion, $10.7 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively.
Leases
For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-
of-use ("ROU") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments
over the term of the lease. If the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not readily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental borrowing rate is used
in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.
Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company
will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with
an initial term of 12 months or less.
For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and
non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and
maintenance.
60
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the
carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as
determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate
reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with
the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived
assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.
Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and
deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2023, the Company's reporting units consisted of
Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a
qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a
quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair
value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying
amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by
determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based
approaches. Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount
and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.
The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2023 and 2022:
(Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S.Walmart
International Sam's Club Total
Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ 2,696 $ 25,966 $ 321 $ 28,983 
Changes in currency translation and other — (415) — (415)
Acquisitions 245 201 — 446 
Balances as of January 31, 2022 2,941 25,752 321 29,014 
Changes in currency translation and other — (1,475) — (1,475)
Acquisitions 433 202 — 635 
Balances as of January 31, 2023 $ 3,374 $ 24,479 $ 321 $ 28,174 
Intangible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had
$4.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of acquired trade names. There were no significant
impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the
asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability
is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the
liability with the creditor. Refer to Note 8 for more information.
Investments
Investments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value of equity securities, as well as
certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis, are recognized within other
gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net
losses of $1.7 billion and $2.4 billion for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively and net gains of $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily due to net changes in
the underlying stock prices of those investments. Refer to Note 8 for details. Equity investments without readily
61
determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.
Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value and adjustments in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company had $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in debt
securities classified as trading.
Indemnification Liabilities
The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification liabilities equal to the estimated fair
value of the obligations upon inception. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company had $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, of certain
legal indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum of potential future
payments under these indemnities was $3.1 billion, based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2023.
Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain
employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an
undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related
to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To
limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for
workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.
Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an
appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks.
The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through
established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty.
The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The Company is subject
to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets
and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-
determined thresholds, after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received from counterparties and cash
collateral provided to counterparties under these arrangements was not significant as of January 31, 2023 and 2022.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and
strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the
nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the
Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. Derivatives with an unrealized gain
are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized
loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 8 for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and
liabilities.
Fair Value Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. All interest
rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the
fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature
on dates ranging from April 2023 to September 2031.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the
forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in
accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from July 2024 to January 2039.
62
Net Investment Hedges
Prior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12, the Company was a party to receive fixed-rate,
pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of these foreign operations. Changes in
fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company also previously designated certain foreign
currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded foreign
currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon closing of the sale of the Company's
operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed
in Note 4.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary
differences"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be
realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative
earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred
tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences,
forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.
In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and
tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,
respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are
presented as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are
recorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each
reporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are
recognized in capital in excess of par. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has a redeemable
noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option
which may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027 with annual options thereafter.
Revenue Recognition    
Net Sales
The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce
sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.
Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membership fee revenue over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $2.6 billion
for fiscal 2023, $2.2 billion for fiscal 2022 and $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the
Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
63
Gift Cards
Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards
in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services
indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a
certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes
revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.
Financial, Advertising and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component
of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of
transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import
distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific
programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as
a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are
recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.
Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the
majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating,
selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments'
distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may
include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and
administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising costs were $4.1 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.2 billion for fiscal 2023,
2022 and 2021, respectively.
Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance
sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of
Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered
by the income statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program
Obligations, which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The amendments are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward
information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied
retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for disclosure of rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively.
Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.
64
Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted
net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the
dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the
calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share
attributable to Walmart:

Note 3. Shareholders' Equity
The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion, of which 2.7 billion and 2.8 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively.
Purchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock
During fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's
Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%. Additionally, the Company
completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming
a 100% owner.
Also during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe, a digital transaction platform in India, from approximately 76% to approximately
89% as part of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. In consideration for the transaction, the Company recorded a liability to
noncontrolling interest holders of $0.9 billion within accrued liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which
reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75%.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all
stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was
$1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating,
selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based
compensation was $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-
based compensation expense by award type for all plans:
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021
Restricted stock units $ 927 $ 659 $ 742 
Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units 444 321 277 
Other 207 183 150 
Share-based compensation expense $ 1,578 $ 1,163 $ 1,169 
The Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan"), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-
vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation
65
awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The
Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.
The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:
•Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2023, restricted stock
units generally vest at a rate of 8% each quarter over a three year period from the date of grant. For grants made from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022,
restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of restricted
stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each
restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is
recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-
average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 2.3%, 3.8%
and 4.4%, respectively.
•Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and
include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance
criteria and generally range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for restricted stock are generally between one month and
three years. Vesting periods for performance-based restricted stock units are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance-
based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair
value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based
restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting
period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-
based restricted stock units in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 3.3%, 4.2% and 4.5%, respectively.
In addition to the Plan, Flipkart and PhonePe have share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire their own common shares
may be issued. These plans may be subject to performance or other conditions, including vesting upon an initial public offering. Share-based compensation
expense associated with certain of these plans is included in the Other line in the table above.

Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.
All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. In November 2022,
the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the
Company can make repurchases, and beginning November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2023 authorization for
$19.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued
status.
The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among
other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The
following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases
for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:

 Includes a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $0.8 billion, for which there was no related income taxes, upon sale of the majority stake in Walmart Argentina. Refer to Note 12.
 Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss, the
majority of which was considered in the impairment evaluation when the individual disposal groups met the held for sale classification in fiscal 2021.
 Upon closing of the noncontrolling interest shareholder buyout of the Company's Massmart subsidiary during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the cumulative amount of currency translation was
reallocated from the Company's noncontrolling interest back to the Company. Refer to Note 3.
Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for foreign currency on matured bonds (reflected in currency translation and other) and
derivatives are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the
cumulative translation resulting from the disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months
are not significant.(1)

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of
the fair value hierarchy are:
•Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
•Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
•Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
As described in Note 1, the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method investments, on a recurring basis
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis are as follows:
(Amounts in millions)Fair Value as of
January 31, 2023Fair Value as of
January 31, 2022
Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 5,099 $ 6,069 
Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 5,570 5,819 
Total $ 10,669 $ 11,888 
71
Derivatives
The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination
of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include
the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the notional amounts and fair values of these
derivatives were as follows:

Total $ 13,921 $ (2,112) $ 15,876 $ (1,095)
Primarily classified in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair
value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.
Upon completing the sales of the Company's operations in the U.K. in February 2021 and Japan in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-
recurring impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to
Note 12. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2023.
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale criteria in fiscal 2021, as further
discussed in Note 12. As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value
measurement based on each transaction's expected consideration. The carrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair
value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the Company recognized non-recurring impairment charges. The aggregate pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion associated with
the divestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for
the year ended January 31, 2021, and included these impairment charges as well as a $2.3 billion charge related to the Asda pension plan. These impairment
charges included the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment
charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their
fair value due to their short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing
rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, are as
follows:
 January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022

Unremitted Earnings
Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered
indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and
repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2023,
the Company has not recorded approximately $3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely
reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.
Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
As of January 31, 2023, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $32.3 billion. Of these carryforwards,
approximately $19.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2043. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.
The realizability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including
taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the
extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the
extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered,
the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $7.8 billion and $9.5 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on deferred tax assets
associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2023 related to valuation allowance builds in
multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of unrealized deferred tax assets.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not
probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.
As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021
Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 3,245 $ 3,135 $ 1,817 
Increases related to prior year tax positions 79 170 92 
Decreases related to prior year tax positions (248) (97) (264)
Increases related to current year tax positions 357 75 1,582 
Settlements during the period (89) (5) (64)
Lapse in statutes of limitations (37) (33) (28)
Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 3,307 $ 3,245 $ 3,135 
The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative
expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. During the next twelve months,
it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are
sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its
Consolidated Financial Statements.
74
The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2018 through 2022. The Company also remains
subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2022, and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the
fiscal years ended 2015 through 2022. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax
authorities for years before fiscal 2013.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in
various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these
examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group
of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and
regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also
discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement
of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a
liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid Related Litigation
During fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously
agreed upon state and tribal settlements. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the
assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Moreover, the Settlement Framework will only take effect once a sufficient number
of political subdivisions join, and there is no assurance regarding such participation. The amount of ultimate loss may thus differ materially from this accrual.
The Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual
and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation.
In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by
various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally
concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No.
2804) (the "MDL") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases
included in the MDL.
Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare providers, and other plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The
Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled
substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids.
On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits
filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county
trial described further below) or pending state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions,
and Native American tribes for up to approximately $3.1 billion (the "Settlement Amount"). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of
alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One
settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement
framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to
collectively as the "Settlement Framework."
The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are contingent upon the number of
states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement
Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement
agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other
75
U.S. territories (the "Settling States"), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. The settlement with the Settling States is
now contingent upon, among other applicable terms and conditions, a sufficient number of political subdivisions also agreeing to participate in the Settlement
Framework.
If all conditions for the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, the minimum participation thresholds applicable for political subdivisions are
satisfied within the prescribed deadlines, then the Company would expect to pay up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling
States, beginning as early as the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and being completed during fiscal 2024. However, the Company cannot predict if, when, or to
what extent the Settlement Framework will be finalized with any of the Settling States.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company paid $0.4 billion for separate settlements with Cherokee Nation, New Mexico, and Florida. Following these
payments, the remaining $2.9 billion liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements is recorded in accrued liabilities within the Company's
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023.
The Settlement Framework also provides for payments to Native American tribes (excluding Cherokee Nation), contingent upon the number of tribes,
including those tribes that have not yet sued the Company, that agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed
within a prescribed deadline (the "Settling Tribes"). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Framework, on March 3, 2023, the Company paid approximately
$0.1 billion to the Settling Tribes in satisfaction of their claims against the Company.
Other Opioid Related Litigation
The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise extinguished by the Settlement Framework,
including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers, as well as
any action filed by a state, political subdivision, or Native American tribe that does not agree to the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not
accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these
matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
Two-county Trial and MDL Bellwethers. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23,
2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted
in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over
fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on
February 20, 2023.
The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five counties ultimately may elect to
participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather than go to trial.
DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled
substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil
penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ
filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion
remains pending.
Opioid Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of
the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January
20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020.
Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully
briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on
October 14, 2022 and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December
22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.
Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April
16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and
dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in
connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27,
2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the
76
current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The
defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22,
2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. On September 26, 2022, the court
held a hearing on that motion, and a ruling remains pending.
Other Legal Proceedings
Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are
proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional
claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the "Asda Equal Value Claims"). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture
of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with
Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company
cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings.
Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters.
Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention
program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was
issued in August 2020. The Company continues to cooperate with and provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also
responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to
money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule
regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint, on October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company filed its reply. The court has entered an
order staying discovery pending a decision on the Company's motion to dismiss. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the
Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise.
Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely
affected.
Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefits
The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The
Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment.
Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching
contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory
limits.
Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans
are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established.
The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021
Defined contribution plans:
U.S. $ 1,491 $ 1,441 $ 1,290 
International 74 39 200 
Total contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,565 $ 1,480 $ 1,490 
Additionally, the Company's previously owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom sponsored a defined benefit pension plan. In fiscal 2020, Asda, Walmart and
the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the "Plan") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $1.0 billion to the
Plan (the "Asda Pension Contribution") which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants, and released
the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $2.3 billion were included in the
disposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in Note 8 and Note 12.
77
Note 12. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items
The following dispositions impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred.
Asda
In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $9.6 billion. Upon
closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income
in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary
purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized
its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred
income taxes and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Asda was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax
loss of $5.5 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Upon classifying the Asda disposal
group as held for sale, $2.3 billion of accumulated pension components associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as
part of the loss. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $0.8 billion related to the estimated fair value of
certain indemnities and other transaction related costs.
Seiyu
In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $1.2 billion. Upon closing
of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the
first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase
price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its
retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Seiyu was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax
loss of $1.9 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Walmart Argentina
In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.0 billion in the third quarter
of fiscal 2021 in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying
value of the disposal group.
Note 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa,
Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for
discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance
and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify
revenues for each of these individual products and services.
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and
certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's
operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the
U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the
Company's segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain
corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate
overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly
78
reviewed by its CODM. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income
taxes, is provided in the following table:

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is
accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our
management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do
not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with
respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such
controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as
implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain
processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial
reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of January 31, 2023. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2023. The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023,
has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we will begin upgrading our financial system, including our general ledger and other applications, in stages. This financial
system will continue to be a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting as it is implemented.

Exhibit 4.8
DESCRIPTION OF  THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT  TO SECTION 12 OF  THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT  OF 1934
As of January 31, 2023, Walmart Inc. (“Walmart ” or the “Company ”) had two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): (i) Common Stock, $0.10 par value per share (“Common
Stock ”) and (ii) 2.550% Notes due 2026 (the “Notes ”). Each of the Company’ s securities registered under Section 12 of the
Exchange Act is listed on The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE ”). Refere nces in this Exhibit to the “Company ,” “us,” “we”
and “our” are solely to Walmart Inc. (parent company only) and not to any of its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
DESCRIPTION OF  COMMON ST OCK
The following is a description of the rights of holders of the Company’ s Common Stock and related provisions of the Company’ s
Restated Certificate  of Incorporation (the “Certificate ”) and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws ”) and applicable
Delaware law, including the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL ”). This description is qualified in its
entirety by , and should be read in conjunction with, the Certificate, Bylaws and applicable Delaware law .
Authorized Capital Stock
Pursuant to our Certificate, our authorized capital stock consists of 11,100,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.10 per share, of
which 11,000,000,000 shares are designated as Common Stock and 100,000,000  shares are designated as preferred stock. At January
31, 2023, we had 2,693,381,600 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock issued and
outstanding. The number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding varies from time to time.
Common Stock
Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Shares; No Liability for Corporate Obligations
All of the outstandin g shares of Commo n Stock are fully paid and non-assessable. A share of Common Stock is fully paid and non-
assessable if such share has been issued  for consideration legally permissible under the DGCL  with a value at least equal to the par
value per share of Common Stock. Holders of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock will not be liable for any
obligations or liabilities of the Company that the Company may fail to dischar ge.
Voting Rights
Each holder of shares of Common Stock  is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters submitted to a vote of
shareholders. Except as noted below or as otherwise required by the DGCL, the vote of shareholders required to decide any matter
brought before a shareholder meeting at which a quorum is present is a majority of the outstanding shares present
1
in person or represented by proxy at that meeting and entitled to vote on the question subject to the shareholder vote. In a contested
election of directors, which is an election in which there are more nominees for election than board positions to be filled, directors
are elected by the vote of a plurality of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at that meeting and entitled
to vote on the election of directors. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our stock must approve any amendments to
our Certificate, any merger or consolidation to which we are a party (other than parent-subsidiary mergers), any sale of all or
substantially all of our assets or our dissolution as a corporation. In addition, the DGCL  requires the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of our stock to approve any conversion of our corporation to another type of entity , such as a limited liability
company . Our shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights as to the election of directors.
Dividends
Subject to the preferential rights of any holders of any series of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future, the holders of
shares of Common Stock are entitled to such dividends and distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as may be declared
from time to time by our board of directors from legally available funds.
Liquidation Distributions
Subject to the prefe rential rights of any holders of any series of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future, upon our
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up and after payment of all prior claims against our assets and our outstanding obligations, the
holders shares of Common Stock will be entitled to receive, pro rata, all of our remaining assets.
Preemptive, Conversion, Redemption or Similar Rights
The holders of shares of Common Stock are not entitled to any preemptive  or other similar rights to subscribe for or acquire
additional shares of Common Stock or any other securities of the Company . The shares of Common Stock are not subject to
conversion or redemption by the Company and the holders of shares of Common Stock do not have any right or option to convert
such shares into any other security or property of the Company or to cause the Company to redeem such shares of Common Stock.
There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock.
Certificate, Bylaws and DGCL
Provisions of the Certificate and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of
the Company or change in the Company’ s management, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a
premium for their shares, or transaction s that shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Among other things,
the Certificate and Bylaws include the following provisions:
i.vacancies on our board of directors, and any new director positions created by the expansion of our board of directors,
may be filled only by a majority of the directors then in of fice, subject to certain exceptions;
ii.our Bylaws establish an advance notic e procedure for shareholders to subm it proposed nominations of persons for
election to our board of directors and other proposals for business to be brought before an annual meeting of our
shareholders;
2
iii.our Bylaws include enhanced procedural and disclosure requirements with which shareholders must comply in
connection proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;
iv.our board of directo rs may issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with designations, rights and preferences as
may be determined from time to time by our board of directors; and
v.our Bylaws may be amended by our shareholders or our board of directors.
Anti-T akeover Provisions of Delaware Law , Our Certificate and Our Bylaws
In addition, as a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to the provisio ns of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits the
Company , subject to certain exceptions described below , from engaging in a “business combination” with:
•a stockholder who owns 15% or more of the Company’ s outstanding voting stock (otherwise known as an “inter ested
stockholder ”);
•an af filiate of an interested stockholder; or
•an associate of an interested stockholder ,
in each case, for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder .
A “business combination ” includes  a merger or sale of more than 10% of the Company’ s assets. However , the above provisions of
Section 203 do not apply if:
•the board of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an “interested stockholder ,” prior to the date
of the transaction;
•after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder , that
stockholder owned at least 85% of the Company’ s voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced,
other than statutorily excluded shares of Common Stock; or
•on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and
authorized at a meeting of the Company’ s stockholders, and not by written consent, by an affirmative vote of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder .
Exclusive Forum Provision
Our Certificate provides that, unless we select or consent in writing to the select ion of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delawa re shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, be the sole
and exclusive forum for any current or former stockholder (including any current or former beneficial owner) to bring claim,
including claims in the right of the corporation (a) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director , officer,
employee or stockholder in such capacity; or (b) as to which the DGCL  confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery .

DESCRIPTION OF  DEBT  SECURITIES
The follow ing description of the Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This description is qualified in its entirety
by referen ce to the Indenture, dated as of July 19, 2005, as supplemented, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company , N.A. (“ BNYM ”), as trustee (the “ Indentur e”).
The Notes
The Notes were issued under the Indenture, which provides that debt securities may be issued under the Indenture from time to time
in one or more serie s. The Indenture and the Notes are governed by, and constru ed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York. The Indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that we may issue under the Indenture. We may, without the consent
of the holders of the debt securities of any series, issue additional debt securiti es ranking equally with, and otherwise similar in all
respects to, the debt securities of the series (except for the public offering price and the issue date) so that those additional debt
securities will be consolidated and form a single series with the debt securities of the series previously of fered and sold.
We issued €650,000,000 aggregate princ ipal amount of the Notes on April 8, 2014. The maturity date of the Notes is April 8, 2026,
and interest at a rate of 2.550% per annum is paid annually on April 8 of each year and on the maturity date. As of January 31,
2023, €650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes was outstanding.
Ranking
The Notes are our senior unsecured debt obligations and rank equally among themselves and with all of our existing and future
unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations. Consequently , the holders of the Notes have a right to payment equal to that of our
other unsecured creditors. None of our subsidiaries have any obligation as to any of the Notes or will guarantee the payment of
amounts owing with respect to any of the Notes. The Indenture does not restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness.
Trustee for  the Notes
BNYM is the truste e under the Indenture. We have commercial deposits and custodial arrangements with BNYM and its affiliates.
We may enter into similar or other banking relationships with BNYM in the future in the normal course of business. In addition,
BNYM acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other debt securities issued by us, and may do so for future issuances of
debt securities by us as well.
Payment on the Notes
All payments of principal of, including payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, and accrued interest on, and the payment
of any additional amounts payable with respect to, the
4
Notes will be payable in euro; provided, however , if the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other
circumstances beyon d our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union
that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international
banking community , then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or
so used. The amoun t payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the Board of Governors
of the U.S. Federal Reserve System as of the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, in
the event the Board  of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System has not mandated a rate of conversion on such date, on the
basis of the most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal  on or most recently  prior to the second
Business Day prior to the relevant paym ent date. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an
event of default under such Notes or the Indenture.
“Business Day” means any day, other than a Saturday or a Sunday , (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions are
authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close in New York City or London and (2) on which the Trans-European
Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, is open.
Payment of Additional Amounts
All payme nts of principal and interest in respect of the Notes will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding
for or on account of any present or futur e taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges of whatsoever nature required to
be deducted or withheld by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States, unless such
withholding or deduction is required by law .
In the event any withholding or deduc tion on payments in respect of the Notes for or on account of any present or future tax,
assessment or other governmental charge is required to be deducted or withheld by the United States or any taxing authority thereof
or therein,  we will pay such additional amounts on the Notes as will result in receipt by each beneficial owner of a Note that is not a
U.S. Person (as defined below) of such amounts (after all such withholding or deduction, including on any additional amounts) as
would have been received by such beneficial owner had no such withholding or deduction been required. We will not be required,
however , to make any payment of additional amounts for or on account of:
i. any tax, assessment or other governme ntal charge that would not have been imposed but for (A) the existence of any
present or former connection (other than a connection arising solely from the ownership of those Notes or the receipt of
payments in respect of those Notes) betw een that beneficial owner , or between a fiduciary , settlor , beneficiary of, member
or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, that beneficial owner , if that beneficial owner is an estate, trust,
partnership or corporation, and the United States, including that beneficial owner , or that fiduciary , settlor , beneficiary ,
member , shareholde r or possessor , being or having been a citizen or resident or treated as a resident of the United States
or being or having been engaged in trade or business or present in the United States or (B) the presentation of a Note for
payment on a date more than 30 days after the later of the date on which
5
that payment becomes due and payable and the date on which payment is duly provided for;
ii. any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer , excise, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental
charge;
iii. any tax, assessment or other governmen tal charge imposed by reason of that beneficial owner ’s past or present status as a
passive foreign investment company , a controlled foreign corporation or a personal holding company with respect to the
United States or as a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;
iv.any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payment of
principal of or premium, if any , or interest on such holder ’s Notes;
v.any tax, assessment  or other governme ntal charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of
principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any Note if that payment can be made without withholding by any other
paying agent;
vi. any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for the failure of a beneficial
owner or any holde r of Notes to comply with our request to comply with certification, information, documentation or
other reporting requirements concerning the nationality , residence, identity or connections with the United States of the
beneficial owner or any holder of the Notes, if such compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the U.S.
Treasury Department as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge,
including, without limitation, any withholding required pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “ Code ”);
vii. any tax, assessment or other governmen tal charge imposed on interest received by (A) a 10% shareholder (as defined in
Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code and the regulations that may be promulgate d thereunder) of our Company or (B) a
controlled foreign corporation that is related to us within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code;
viii. any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to that
European Union Directive relating to the taxation of savings adopted on June 3, 2003 by the European Union’ s Economic
and Financial Affairs Council, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such
Directive; or
ix. any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii).
In addition , we will not pay any additional amounts to any beneficial owner or holder of Notes who is a fiduciary or partnership to
the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to that fiduciary or a member of that partnership or a beneficial owner thereof
would not have been entitled to the payment of those additional amounts had that beneficiary , settlor , member or beneficial owner
been the beneficial owner of those Notes.
6
As used in the preceding paragraph, “Non-U.S. Person ” means any corporation, partnership, individual or fiduciary that is, as to the
United States, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual who has not made a valid election to be treated as a United
States resident, a non-resident fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust or a foreign partnership, one or more of the members of which is,
as to the United States, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual or a non-resident fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust.
Redemption for  Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any change or amendment to the laws, treaties, regulation s or rulings of the United States or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof,  any proposed change in such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings, or any change in the
official application, enforcement or interpretation of those laws, treaties, regula tions or rulings, we become, or based upon a written
opinion of independent counsel selected by us, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described above under the
heading “Payments of Additional Amounts” with respect to the Notes, then we may redeem the Notes, in whole, but not in part, at
our option, on not more than 60 days’  and not less than 30 days’  prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any , on the Notes to the date fixed for redemption.
Optional Redemption
We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at our option, at any time. If the Notes are redeemed before January 8, 2026, then the
Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
•100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; or
•the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of princip al and interest thereon (not including
any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption),  discounted to the date of redemption
on an annual basis (Actual/Actual (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below),
plus 15 basis points,
plus, in each case, accrued and unpai d interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the date fixed for
redemption.
Any Notes  redeeme d on or after January 8, 2026, will be redeemed at a redemp tion price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interes t on the principal amount being redeemed to, but
excluding, the date fixed for redemption.
Installments of interest on Notes being redeemed that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a
redemption date shall be payable on the interest payment date to the holders as of the close of business on the relevant regular record
date according to the Notes and the Indenture.
“Comparable Government Bond”  means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation for the Notes, at the
discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of
the Notes, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue,
7
such other  German government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market
makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government
Bond Rate.
“Comparable Gove rnment Bond Rate”  means the price, expressed as a percent age (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005
being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes being redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such
price on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such
Business Day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond
prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Business Day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us. Such
independent bank will calculate such gross redemption yield on the Notes to be redeemed and the Comparable Government Bond in
accordance with generally accepted market practices at the time of such calculations.
Covenants
The Indenture sets forth limited covenants that apply to the Notes. However , these covenants do not, among other things:
•limit the amount of indebtedness or lease obligations that may be incurred by us and our subsidiaries;
•limit our ability or that of our subsidiaries to issue, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens; or
•restrict us from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or redeeming our capital
stock.
Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets
The Indenture provides that we may amalgamate, consolidate with, merge into or transfer our assets substantially as an entirety to
any person; provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
•any successor to us (a “ Successor ”) assumes our obligations on the Notes and under the Indenture;
•any Successor be an entity incorporated or or ganized under the laws of the United States;
•after givin g effect to such transaction, no event of default, as described below under “-Events of Default,” has
occurred and is continuing; and
•certain other conditions under the Indenture are met.
Upon any amalgamation, consolidation, merger, reorganization or arrangement or any conveyance or transfer of the properties and
assets of the Company substantially as an entirety , the Successor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right
and power  of, the Company , as the case may be, under the Indenture with the same effect as if such Successor had been named as the
Company therein.
8
Any such amalgama tion, consolidation,  merger or transfer of assets substantially as an entirety that meets the conditions described
above would not constitute a default or event of default that would entitle holders of the Notes or the trustee, on their behalf, to take
any of the actions described below under “-Events of Default.”
Events of Default
Each of the followin g events are defined in the Indenture as an “event of default” with respect to the debt securities of any series,
including the Notes:
i.we fail to pay interest on any outstanding debt securities of that series when that interest is due and payable and that
failure continues for 30 days;
ii.we fail to pay principal of or premium, if any, on any outstanding debt securi ties of that series when that principal or
premium, if any , is due and payable;
iii.we fail to perform or we breach any covenant or warranty in the Indenture with respect to any outstanding debt securities
of that series and that failure continues for 90 days after we receive written notice of that default;
iv.certain events of bankruptcy , insolvency or reor ganization occur with respect to us; or
v.any other event occurs that is designated as an event of default with respect to the particular series of debt securities
when that particular series of debt security is established.
An event of default  with respect to the debt securities of any series issued under the Indenture does not necessarily constitute an
event of default with respect to the debt securities of any other series issued under the Indenture.
If an event of default with respect to any series of outstanding debt securities occurs and is continuing (other than an event of default
relating to certain events of bankruptcy , insolvency or reorganization with respect to us), the trustee or the holders of not less than
25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount of the
outstanding debt securities of that serie s to be immediately due and payable. If an event of default relating to certain events of
bankruptcy , insolven cy or reorganization with respect to us occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest
on the then outstanding debt securities of all series issued under the Indenture will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders.
The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may rescind a
declaration of acceleration and its consequences, if we have deposited certain sums with the trustee and all events of default with
respect to the debt securities of such series, other than the nonpayment of the principal which have become due solely by such
acceleration, have been cured or waived, as provided in the Indenture.
An event of default for a particular serie s of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series of
debt securities issued under the Indenture.
9
We are required to file annually with the trustee a written statement as to the existence or non-existence of defaults under the
Indenture or any series of debt securities issued thereunder .
No holder  of any debt securities of any series, including the Notes, will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy , unless:
i.such holder has previously given written notice to the trustee of a continuing event of default with respect to the debt
securities of such series;
ii.the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have made a written
request to the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event of default in its own name as trustee;
iii.such holde r or holders have offered to the trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred in compliance with such request;
iv.the trustee for 60 days after its receipt  of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
proceeding; and
v.no direction inconsistent with such writt en request has been given to the trustee during such 60-day period by the holders
of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more holders of the debt securities of such series has any right in any manner
whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of the Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other holders
of the debt securities of such series or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other such holders or to enforce
any right under the Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the holders of the debt
securities of such series.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of a series will have the right, subject to
certain limitations, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with
respect to the debt securities of that series or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee, and to waive certain defaults.
The Indenture provides that if an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights and powers
under the Indenture , and use the same degree of care and skill in their exerc ise, as a prudent person would exercise under the
circumstances in the conduct of such person’ s own af fairs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any debt security will have the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any
payment of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on that debt security or any redemption price or repurchase price when due
and that that right will not be impaired without the consent of that holder .
Modification and Waivers
We and the trustee may execute a supplemental indenture to add provisions to or to eliminate or change provisions of the Indenture
or to modify otherw ise the rights of the holders of the Notes if we have the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes af fected by that supplemental indenture. However , we and the trustee may not execute
10
a supplem ental indenture without the consent of each holder of the Notes affected by that supplemental indenture if that supplement
indenture would, among other things:
•change the maturity of the principal of, or the stated maturity of any installment of interest or premium, if any, on, any
Note, reduce the principal amount of or the premium, if any, or rate of interest on any Note, change any method for
determining the rate of interest on any Note, change the obligation to pay any additional amounts with respect to any
Note, reduce the amount due and payable on a Note upon the acceleration of its maturity or upon its repurchase or
redemption if the amount payable upon acceleration, repurchase or redemption is otherwise less than the stated
principal amount of that Note, change the method of calculating interest on a Note, change the currency in which the
principal of or the premium, if any, or interest on a Note is payable, reduce the minimum rate of interest on any Note
or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to any such holder ’s
Notes;
•reduce the percentage in principal amou nt of outstanding Notes described above as being required to consent to entry
into a particular supplemental indenture or for the waiver of certain defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences; or
•modify the provisions of the Indenture relating to modification of the Indenture, except in certain specified respects.
The trustee and we, without the consent of any holders, may execute a supplemental indenture to, among other things:
•evidence the succession of another corporation to us and the Successor ’s assumption to our covenants with respect to
the Notes and the Indenture;
•add to our covenants further restrictions or conditions for the benefit of holders of the Notes;
•cure ambiguities or correct or supplement any provision contained in the Indenture or any supplemental indenture that
may be inconsistent with another provision;
•add additional events of default with respect to the Notes;
•add to, change or eliminate any provision of the Indenture, provided that the addition, change or elimination will not
affect any outstanding Notes;
•establish new series of debt securities and the form or terms of such series of debt securities and to provide for the
issuance of securities of any series so established;
•evidence and provide for the acceptance  of appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Notes and to add or
change any provision to or of the Indenture as necessary to have more than one trustee under the Indenture; and
•comply with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in order to maintain the qualification
of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
11
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may waive an event of default resulting in
acceleration of the Notes and rescind and annul that acceleration, but only if all other events of default with respect to the Notes have
been reme died or waived and all payme nts due with respect to the Notes, other than those becoming due as a result of acceleration,
have been  made. If an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the trustee may, in its discretion, and will,
at the written request of holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes and upon
reasonable indemnit y against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request and subject to certain
other conditions set forth in the Indenture, proceed to protect the rights of the holders of the Notes.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may waive any past default under the Indenture and its
consequences except an uncured default in the payment of principal of and premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or with respect
to any covenant or provision of the Indenture that the Indenture or the Notes specifically provide cannot be waived without the
consent of each holder of the Notes. Upon such a waiver , the default and any event of default arising out of the default will be
deemed cured for all purposes of the Notes.
Discharge, Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
We may , at our option, elect to have all of the obligations dischar ged with respect to the outstanding Notes, except for:
•the rights of holders of the Notes to receive payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if
any, from the trust referred to below when those payments are due;
•our obligations respecting the Notes concerning issuing temporary debt securities, registration of transfers of debt
securities, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen debt securities, the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for payments with respect to the Notes being held in trust;
•the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee and our obligations in connection therewith; and
•the provisions of the Indenture relating to such a dischar ge of obligations.
We refer to a dischar ge of this type as “ legal defeasance .”
In additio n, other than our covenant to pay the amounts due and owing with respect to the Notes, we may elect to have our
obligations as the issuer of the Notes released with respect to covenants relating  to the Notes. Thereafter , any failure to comply with
those obligations will not constitute a default or event of default with respect to the Notes. If such a release of our covenants occurs,
our failure  to perform or our breach of the covenants or warranties defeased will no longer constitute an event of default with respect
to the Notes. We refer to a dischar ge of this type as “ covenant defeasance .”
To exercise either of the defeasance rights described above as to the outstanding Notes, certain conditions must be met, including:
12
•we must irrevocably deposit with the trustee, in trust for the benefit of the holders of the outstanding Notes, moneys
in the currency in which the Notes are denominated, securities issued by a government, governmental agency or
central bank of the country in whose currency the Notes are denominated or a combination of cash and such
securities, in amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding
Notes to be af fected by the defeasance at their stated maturity;
•no default or event of default exists on the date of such deposit, subject to certain exceptions;
•the trustee must receive an opinion of counsel confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of that legal defeasance or covenant defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if that defeasa nce had not occurred, which opinion, only in the case of the legal defeasance
of the Notes, will be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in United States federal income
tax law to that ef fect occurring after the date of the Indenture; and
•the trustee must receive an opinion of counsel to the effect that, after the 91st day following the deposit, the trust
funds will not be part of any “estate” formed by the bankruptcy of the party depositing those funds with the trustee or
subject to the “automatic stay” under the United States Bankruptcy Code or, in the case of covenant defeasance, will
be subject to a first priority lien in favor of the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the outstanding Notes.
We may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option.
Book-Entry and Settlement
The Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary
on behalf of Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstr eam”) and Euroclear Bank SA/NV , as the operator of the Euroclear
System (“Euroclear ”), and are registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the global
notes will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be made only through, records maintained by
Euroclear and Clearstream. Except as described below , certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the
global notes.
Certificated Notes
Subject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated debt securities with the
same terms in authorized denominations only if:
•The Depository Trust Company , Eurocl ear or Clearstream, as the case may be, is unwilling or unable to continue as
depositary or ceases to be a clearing agency
13
registered under applicable law , and a successor is not appointed by us within 90 days; or
•we decide to discontinue the book-entry system; or
•an event of default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes.
Any Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in
such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global note is not exchangeable, except for a global
note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee.

WALMAR T DEFERRED COMPENSA TION MA TCHING PLAN
ARTICLE I.
GENERAL
1.1 Purpose.
The purpose of the Walmart Deferred Compensation Matching Plan is to enable certain individuals to defer compensation
and to be credited with matching allocations and earnings. The Plan is intended  to reward such individuals for their contributions to
the success of Walmart and its Related  Affiliates. The Plan is also intended to assist such individuals in saving for retirement by
providing benefits that are in excess of benefits permitted by applicable law under the 401(k) Plan.
1.2 Effective Date.
The ef fective date of the amended and restated Plan is February 1, 2023.
1.3 Natur e of Plan.
The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of
management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA . The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and
for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A
Participant’ s interest s under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer . Nothing
herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, the Plan
Administrator , Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, the Participant’ s beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any
person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other
unsecured general creditor of Walmart. The Plan is intended to be in compliance with Code Section 409A  and shall be interpreted,
applied and administered at all times in accordance with Code Section 409A  and guidance issued thereunder .

be revoked , changed or modified after the applicable deferral election filing deadline specified in Sections 3.1(b)(1),
3.2(b)(1), and 3.2(b)(2), and a deferral election or elections under Sections 3.1(b)(2), 3.2(b)(3), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c), and
the corresponding account allocation election or elections under Section 3.5, may not be revoked, changed or
modified after the date of each such deferral election as provided in Sections 3.1(b)(2), 3.2(b)(3), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c). A
deferral election for one Plan Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if a
deferral is desired for a subsequent Plan Year, a separate election must be made by the Eligible Participant.
(b) In the event an Eligible Officer has a Separation from Service for any reason, then his or her deferral election under
Section 3.1 will terminate as of the date of such Separation from Service (but will be effective with respect to the last
regular paycheck issued to such Eligible Officer), regardless of whether the Eligible Officer continues to receive
Compensation, or other remuneration, from any Employer or Related Affiliate thereafter . If an Eligible Officer has a
Separation from Service for any reason and is rehired (whether or not as an Eligible Officer) within the same Plan
Year, his or her deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 shall be automatically reinstated and shall remain in effect
for the remainder of such Plan Year.
(c) In the event an Eligible Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason, then his or her deferral elections, if
any, under  Sections 3.2 and 3.3 will remain in effect with respect to the bonus, if any, subject to any such deferral
election. If an Eligible Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason  and is rehired (whether or not as an
Eligible Participant) within the same Plan Year or the same performance period, his or her deferral elections, if any,
under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 will remain in effect with respect to the bonus, if any, subject to any such deferral
elections.
(d) In the event an Eligible Participant who is an Eligible Officer ceases to be an Eligible Officer (other than on account
of a Separ ation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her Compens ation deferral election, if any, under
Section 3.1 will terminate as of the next following January 31. In addition, in the event the Compensation of such
individual is reduced as a result of the change in status, his or her deferral election following such loss and through
the date of termination of such election  as provided in the preceding sentence will be pro rated based on his or her
new level of Compensation.
(e) In the event an Eligible Officer receives Company-paid short term disability payments and the Compensation of such
individual is reduced as a result of the short term disability status, then following such reduction in Compensation his
or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 will be pro rated based on his or her new level of
Compensation through the date of termination of such election.
    - 14 -
(f) In the event an Eligible Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant (other than on account of a Separation from
Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her bonus deferral election, if any, under Section 3.2 will terminate for any
performance period beginning in the calendar year following the year of the loss of Eligible Participant status.
(g) In the event an Eligible Participant who is an Eligible Officer ceases to be an Eligible Officer (other than on account
of Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her bonus defer ral election, if any, under Section 3.3
will remain in ef fect.
(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , in the event an Eligible Officer goes on an unpaid leave of absence,
his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 shall automatically cease when he or she
commences the unpaid leave of absence ; provided, however , that if he or she returns from the unpaid leave of absence
during the same Plan Year, his or her Compensation deferral election under Section 3.1 shall automatically resume
immediately upon return from the leave of absence and shall continue in effect for the balance of the Plan Year. An
Eligible Officer’s Compensation deferra l election under Section 3.1, if any, shall remain in effect with respect to any
Compensation to which such election applies that is paid while on a leave of absence. An Eligible Participant’ s
deferral election under Sections 3.2 or 3.3, if any , shall not be af fected by his or her leave of absence.
3.7 Automatic Suspension of Deferral Elections.
In the event a Participant requests a distribution pursuant to Section 5.5 due to an Unforeseeable Emer gency , or the
Participant requests a cancellation of deferrals under the Plan in order to allevia te his or her Unforeseeable Emer gency , and the Plan
Administrator or his or her delegate determines that the Participant’ s Unforeseeable Emer gency may be relieved through the
cessation of deferral s under the Plan, some or all the Participant’ s deferral elect ions under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, if any, for such
Plan Year as determ ined by the Plan Administrator or his or her delegate, shall be cancelled as soon as administratively practicable
following such determination by the Plan Administrator or his or her delegate.

accordance with Section 4.4(a)(1). Once earnings are elected under Section 4.4(a)(2) with respect to any portion of a
Participant’ s Pre-Inv estments Portion, such Participant shall be prohibited from subsequently electing to receive
interest with respect to such portion in accordance with Secton 4.4(a)(1).
(b) Every Valuation Date during a Plan Year, the Post-Investments Portion of a Participant’ s Account, if any, will be
credited with earnings, gains and losses based on the results that would have been achieved had amounts credited to
his or her Account been invested as soon as practicable after crediting into the Investment Options selected by the
Participant.

forms:
(1) a lump sum;
    - 20 -
(2) subject to the minimum account value restriction below , substantially equal annual installments over a period
not to exceed fifteen (15) years; or
(3) solely with respect to distribution of the Participant’ s Account in the event of death, partially a lump sum and,

not to exceed fifteen (15) years;
Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(A) With respect to an installment election applicable to a Retirement Account under a Participant’ s Pre-
2021 Class Account, such election will be given effect only if, as of the date on which any lump sum
payment would be valued, the value of such Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, the
Participant’ s Account, is at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). If such Retirem ent Account, or in the
event of death, the Participant’ s Account, is valued at less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) as of
the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued, such Retirem ent Account shall be
defaulted to a lump sum payment.
(B) With respe ct to an installment election applicable to a Retirement Account under a Participant’ s Post-
2020 Class Account, such election will be given effect only if, as of the date on which any lump sum
payment would be valued, the combined value of all of the Participant’ s Retirement Accounts subject
to an installment election under his or her Post-2020 Class Accounts, or, in the event of death, the
Participant’ s Account, is at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). If the total of all such Retirement
Accounts, or in the event of death, the Participant’ s Account, is valued at less than fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000) as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued, such Retirement
Account shall be defaulted to a lump sum payment.
(C)  For purposes of clarification, to the extent a Retirement Account, or in the even t of death, an Account,
is defaulte d to a lump sum payment pursuant to paragraph (A) or (B) above, such lump sum payment
shall be paid at the same time the first installment with respect to such Retirement Account or Account
would have been paid but for the application of paragraph (A) or (B) above.
(b) Subsequent Electio ns. In accordance with the procedures and rules establ ished by the Plan Administrator , a
Participant may change his or her distribution election (or deemed distribution election) with respect to his or her
Retirement Account , or, in the event of death, his or her Account, per this Section 5.4 at any time by making a new
election (referred to in this subsection as a “subsequent election”) on a form (which may be electronic) approved by,
and filed with, the
    - 21 -
Plan Administrator; provided, however , that such subsequent election shall be subject to the following restrictions:
(1) A subsequent election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which such
subsequent election is made;
(2) Payment or initial payment pursuant to a subsequent election may not be made earlier than five (5) years from
the date such paym ent would have been made absent the subsequent election (but, for this purpose,
installment payments shall not commence until the first January 31 after such delay), unless the distribution is
made on account of the Participant’ s death;
(3) A subsequent election related to a payment must be made not less than twelve (12) months before the date the
payment is scheduled to be paid;

election must be completed by the last day of the Plan Year which contains the twentieth (20) anniversa ry of
the Participant’ s Separation Pay Date or the Participant’ s death;
(5) For purposes of this Section 5.4(b) and Code Section 409A, the entitlement to annual installment payments is
treated as the entitlement to a single payment.
If a Participant’ s distribution election does not satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b), it will not be recognized
or given effect by the Plan Administrator . In that event, distribution of the benefit will be made in accordance with the
Participant’ s most recent distribution election which does satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b).
(c) Filing of Election. A Participant’ s distribution election applicable to the Participant’ s Account in the event of the
Participant’ s death prior to Separation from Service, and a Participant’ s distribution election with respect to the
Participant’ s Retirem ent Account or Retirement Accounts, and the Participant’ s Scheduled Pay Date with respect to
the Partic ipant’ s Scheduled In-Service  Accounts, must be filed with, and on forms (which may be electronic)
prescribed by , the Plan Administrator .
5.5 Distributions for  Unfor eseeable Emergencies.
(a) In the event of an Unforeseeable Emer gency, the Plan Administrator or his or her delegate, in its sole and absolute
discretion and upon written application of a Participant or, following the Participant’ s death, the beneficiary to whom
a Participa nt’s benefits are then being paid, or will be paid, pursuant to Section 5.3, may direct immediate distribution
of all or a portion of the Participant’ s Account (excluding the Participant’ s Matching Account and related earnings if
the Participant is not fully vested in his or her Matching Account). The Plan Administrator will permit distribution on
account of an Unforeseeable Emer gencyth
    - 22 -
only to the extent reasonably necessary to satisfy the emer gency need, plus amounts necessary to pay federal, state or
local income taxes and penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution, after taking into account the
extent to which such need is or may be relieved through reimbursement or comp ensation by insurance, by liquidation
of the Participant’ s or beneficiary’ s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe
financial hardship), or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. Any distribution under this Section 5.5 shall first be
made from the Participant’ s Scheduled In-Service Accounts with respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan
Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5, and then from the Participant’ s Retirement Accounts with respect to
Deferral Credits made in the same Plan Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5, and then proratably from the
remaining amount of the Participant’ s Scheduled In-Service Accounts and then proratably from the Participant’ s
Retirement Accounts.
(b) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary , if the Plan Administrator reasonably anticipates that its
deduction with respect to any distributi on under this Section 5.5 that occurs prior to January 1, 2021 would not be
permitted due to the application of Code Section 162(m); such payment shall be suspended to the extent a deduction
would not be permitted until the earliest date at which it reasonably anticipates that the deduction of such distribution
would not be barred  by application of Code Section 162(m); provided, however , that the conditions of Section 5.5(a)
are still satisfied as of such date.
5.6 Distributions for  Payment of Taxes.
The Plan Administrator may accelerate  and pay a portion of a Participant’ s Plan benefits in a lump sum equal to (a) the
Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax imposed on Plan benefits and any income tax withholding related to such amounts, as well
as (b) any state, local or foreign tax obligations arising from participation in the Plan (and related withholding under Code Section
3401) that apply to the amounts deferred under the Plan before such amount is paid or made available to the Participant.
5.7 Reductions Arising fr om a Participant’ s Gross Misconduct.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , a Participant’ s Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not
engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an
ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’ s Statement of Ethics. In the event the Plan
Administrator determines that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct  during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding
any provisions hereunder to the contrary: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Employer Matching Contribution Credits and credited
Plan earni ngs thereon; (b) earnings credi ted to the Participant’ s Deferral Accounts shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect
the amoun t which would otherwise have been credited if the applicable Interest Rate (or if a portion of such Deferral Accounts is
being credited with earnings, gains and losses, the positive earnings rate (if any) for such Plan Year) were fifty percent (50%) of the
Interest Rate in ef fect (or positive earnings rate, as applicable) for such Plan Year; and (c) if the
    - 23 -
Participant is then receiving installment payments, any remaining installments shall be recalculated to reflect the amount which
would otherwise have been paid if the applicable Interest Rate (or positive earni ngs rate, as applicable) were fifty percent (50%) of
the Interest Rate in effect (or positive earnings rate, as applicable) with respect to such installment payments. For the avoidance of
doubt, if a portion of a Participant’ s Deferral Accounts is being credited with earnings, gains and losses and such portion
experiences a net loss for a Plan Year, such net loss shall not be adjusted as a result of the Participant’ s engaging in Gross
Misconduct under this Section 5.7. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the Participant’ s Deferred
Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus and Deferred Special Bonus as a result of the Participant’ s engaging in Gross Misconduct
under this Section 5.7. Any payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant’ s beneficiary) are contingent upon the
Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or
any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’ s Statement of
Ethics. If the Plan Administrator determines, after payment of amounts hereunder , that the Participant has engaged in Gross
Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant’ s beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart any amount in
excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.7.

APPENDIX A
WALMAR T INC.
OFFICER DEFERRED COMPENSA TION PLAN
ARTICLE I.
GENERAL
1.1 Purpose.
Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) established the Officer Deferred Compensation Plan. The purpose of the Plan has been to: (a)
attract and retain the valuable services of certain officers; (b) recognize, reward, and encourage contributions by such officers to the
success of Walmart and its Related Affiliates; (c) enable such officers to defer certain compensation and bonuses, and to be credited
with earnings and Incentive Payments with respect to such amounts recognized  hereunder for such purposes; and (d) allow certain
equity incentive awards deferred under the Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2005 to be credited under this Plan at the election of
the grantee and to thereafter be subject to the terms of this Plan.
In Article VIII of the Plan, Walmart reserved the right to amend, suspend or to terminate the Plan in any manner that it deems
advisable by action of the Committee. Walmart previously amended and resta ted the Plan in certain respects, including to cease
deferral elections effective February 1, 2012. Further , the Plan was renamed effective on February 1, 2018. Walmart now desires to
provide participants  with the opportunity to receive notional earnings based on predetermined actual investments. Accordingly , the
Plan is amended as set forth in this amendment and restatement ef fective February 1, 2023.
1.2 Effective Dates; Code Section 409A.
(a) This Plan was initial ly effective February l, 1996 and was most recently amended and restated as of February 1, 2012.
This amen dment and restatement is effective February 1, 2023. This Plan (other than Appendix A) is intended to be in
compliance with Code Section 409A  and shall be interpreted, applied and administered at all times in accordance with
Code Section 409A, and guidance issued thereunder .
(b) Amounts deferred and vested under the Plan on or before December 31, 2004  shall continue to be governed at all
times by the Plan as in effect on such date, which Plan is attached hereto as Appendix A. Appendix A shall not be
materially modified (within the meaning  of Code Section 409A) (formally or informally , including by interpretation),
unless such modification expressly provides that it is intended to be a material modification within the meaning of
Code Section 409A  and guidance issued thereunder .
1.3 Natur e of Plan.
The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of
management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA . The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and
for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A
Participant’ s interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against
1
specific assets of Walmart or any Employer . Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary
relationship between  the Committee, Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, the Participant’ s beneficiary or any other person.
To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of
any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart.

(a) Each Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s bonus (if any) for a performance
period under the MIP. All bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.2 must be filed with Executive
Compensation on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation. Notwithstanding any
provisions hereunde r to the contrary , no deferral election may be made by an Eligible Officer with respect to the
Eligible Of ficer’s bonus (if any) for any performance period under the MIP  that begins on or after February 1, 2012.
(b) Bonus deferral elections must be filed:
(1) for perform ance periods under the MIP beginning before January 1, 2009, within the time period provided
under applicable prior Plan documents;
(2) for performance periods under the MIP beginning on or after January 1, 2009, the bonus deferral election must
be filed:
(A) no later than the December 31 preceding the performance period for which the deferral election is to
be ef fective; or

Procedures, or any other plan required by Code Section 409A  to be aggregated with this Plan. For
purposes of this rule, an Eligible Of ficer will not be treated as a participant in any such plan if:
(i) he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan (or the SIP Deferral Procedures or any other
plan required by Code
8
Section 409A  to be aggregated with this Plan) at any time
during the twenty-four (24)-month period ending on the
date he or she again becomes an Eligible Of ficer, or
(ii) he or she was paid all amounts previously due under the Plan (and the SIP Deferral Procedures

paid for services performed after such election. For this purpose, the amount of the bonus payable to
the Eligible Officer for services rendered subsequent to the Eligible Officer’s election will be
determined by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days remaining in the performance period after the election and the denominator of which is the total
number of calendar  days in such performance period. For purposes of this Section 3.2(b)(2)(B), the
date of an Eligible Officer’s election is the date the executed election form (which may be electronic)
is received by Executive Compensation.

performance periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010, the Eligible Officer may also elect to allocate his or her

deferral elections made on or after February 1, 2010, the Eligible Officer may also elect to allocate his or her Special
Bonus deferrals to one or more Scheduled In-Service Accounts, in addition to his or her Retirement Accounts. If an

Retirement Account s. If an Eligible Officer allocates deferrals to a new Scheduled In-Service Account, he or she must
also designate the Scheduled Pay Date with respect to such Account.
3.5 Incentive Payments.
An Eligible Officer who first becomes  a Participant after December 31, 2008 must make an election with respect to the
allocation of his or her Incentive Payments, if any, between his or her Retireme nt Accounts. Such election must be made within the
earliest of the time periods applicable under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3. and 3.4 for making an initial deferral election for the first Plan
Year of participation . In the event the Participant fails to make a timely election with respect to the allocation of his or her Incentive
Payments, the Participant shall be deem ed to have elected to have his or her Incentive Payments allocated entirely to his or her
Retirement Account #1. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , once made (or deemed made), a Participant’ s allocation
election under this Section 3.5 is irrevocable.
3.6 Irrevocability of Deferral Elections.
(a) Except as otherwise  provided herein, once made for a Plan Year, a deferral election under Sections 3.1(b)(1), 3.1(c),
3.2(b)(1), 3.2(c), 3.3(b)(1), 3.3(c), 3.4(b)and 3.4(c) may not be revoked, changed or modified after the applicable

not be revoked, chan ged or modified after the date of the election as provided in Sections 3.1(b)(2) and 3.2(b)(2). An
election for one Plan Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if deferral is
desired for a subsequent Plan Year, a separate election must be made by the Eligible Officer for such Plan Year or
performance period. Notwithstanding the preceding, if an Eligible Officer makes a deferral election for a Plan Year
but fails to make an election as to the allocation of deferrals for such Plan Year among his or her Accounts, such
deferrals shall be allocated based on source in the same manner as they were
11
allocated for such source for the last Plan Year for which the Participant made an
allocation election or , if none, equally to his or her then ef fective Retirement
Accounts.
(b) In the event an Eligible Officer has a Separation from Service for any reason, then: (1) his or her deferral election
under Section 3.1 will terminate as of the date of such Separation from Service (but will be effective with respect to
the last regular paycheck issued to such Eligible Officer), regardless of whether the Eligible Officer continues to
receive Compensati on, or other remun eration, from Walmart or any Employer thereafter; (2) his or her deferral
election under Section 3.2 will remain in effect with respect to the bonus (if any) paid to him or her under the MIP for
the perform ance period in which such Separation from Service occurs; (3) his or her deferral election under Section
3.3 will remain in effect with respect to any Special Bonus (if any) paid to him or her to which such election relates;
and (4) his or her deferral election under Section 3.4 will remain in effect with respect to any Retention Bonus (if any)
paid to him or her to which such election relates.
(c) If an Eligible Officer has a Separation from Service for any reason and is rehired (whether or not as an Eligible
Officer) within the same Plan Year or performance period, as applicable, his or her deferral elections under Sections
3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 shall be automatically reinstated and shall remain in effect for the remainder of such Plan Year or
performance period, as applicable.
(d) In the event an Eligible Of ficer ceases to be an Eligible Of ficer (other than on account of a Separation from Service):
(1) during any Plan Year, then his or her deferral election under Section 3.1 will terminate as of the next following
December 31. In addition, in the event the Compensation of such individual  is reduced as a result of the
change in status, his or her deferral election following such loss and through the date of termination of such
election as provided in the preceding  sentence will be pro rated based on his or her new level of
Compensation;
(2) then his or her deferral election under Section 3.2 will terminate for any perform ance period beginning in the
calendar year following the year of the loss of Eligible Of ficer status;
(3) then his or her deferral election under Section 3.3 shall continue in effect with respect to any Special Bonuses
(if any) paid after such loss of Eligible Of ficer status; and
(4) then his or her deferral election under Section 3.4 shall continue in effect with respect to any Retention
Bonuses (if any) paid after such loss of Eligible Of ficer status.
(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , in the event an Eligible Officer goes on an unpaid leave of absence,
his or her deferral election under Section
12
3.1 shall automatically cease when he or she commences the unpaid leave of
absence; provided, however , that if he or she returns from the unpaid leave of
absence during the same Plan Year, his or deferral election under Section 3.1 shall
automatically resume immediately upon return from the leave of absence and shall continue in effect for the balance
of the Plan Year. An Eligible Officer’s deferral election under Section 3.1 shall remain in effect with respect to any
Compensation paid while on a leave of Absence. An Eligible Officer’s deferral elections under Sections 3.2, 3.3 and
3.4 shall not be af fected by his or her leave of absence.
3.7 Automatic Suspension of Deferral Elections.
(a) In the event a Participant receives a distribution from the Walmart 401(k) Plan (or any other plan or successor plan
sponsored by Walmart or any Related Affiliate) on account of hardship, which distribution is made pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(k)-1 (d)(3) and requires suspension of defer rals under other arrangements such as
this Plan, the Participant’ s deferral elect ions under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, if any, pursuant to which deferrals
would otherwise be made during the six (6)-month period following the date of the distribution shall be cancelled.
(b) In the event a Participant requests a distribution pursuant to Section 5.5 due to an Unforeseeable Emer gency , or the
Participant requests a cancellation of deferrals under the Plan in order to alleviate his or her Unforeseeable
Emer gency , and the Committee determi nes that the Participant’ s Unforeseeable Emer gency may be relieved through
the cessation of deferrals under the Plan, some or all the Participant’ s deferral elections under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
and 3.4 for such Plan Year or performance period, as applicable, if any, as determined by the Committee, shall be
cancelled as soon as administratively practicable following such determination by the Committee.
3.8 Employer  Contribution Cr edits.
    As of any date during a Plan Year, Walmart may credit to a Participant’ s Company Account an amount determined in the sole

schedule imposed by the Committee. The Participant’ s Company Account shall be distributed pursuant to Article V only to the extent
vested as of the applicable distribution date.

3.10 Natur e of Accounts.
Each Participant’ s Account will be used solely as a measuring device to determ ine the amount to be paid a Participant under
this Plan. The Accounts do not constitu te, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of any kind. All amounts at any time
attributable to a Participant’ s Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart. A Participant’ s rights hereunder are limited

provided by the Plan.

ARTICLE IV .
ADDITIONS TO ACCOUNTS -- CREDITED EARNINGS
AND INCENTIVE P AYMENTS
4.1 Credited Earnings.
(a) Effective for Plan Years commencing on or after February 1, 2023, every Valuation Date during a Plan Year, a
Participant’ s Account will be credited with either of the following, as elected by the Participant in accordance with
Section 4.1(a):
(1) Interest at the Interest Rate, which shall be for the entire month and calculated based on the value of the
Participant’ s Account as of the immedia tely preceding Valuation Date, resulting in the monthly compounding
of interest on each Valuation Date; or
14
(2) Earnings, gains and losses based on the results that would have been achieved had amounts credited to the
Account been invested as soon as practicable after such election into the Investment Options selected by the
Participant.
The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall establish one or more windows of time during which a Participant may
irrevocably elect for all or a portion of his or her Account to be credited with earnings, gains and losses in accordance
with Section 4.1(a)(2). If a Participant does not make such an election in accordance with the procedures established
by the Committee in its sole discretion, the Participant’ s entire Account shall be credited with interest in accordance
with Section 4.1(a)(1). Once earnings are elected under Section 4.1(a)(2) with respect to any portion of a Participant’ s
Account, such Participant shall be prohibited from subsequently electing to receive interest with respect to such
portion in accordance with Section 4.1(a)(1).
(b) The Committee shall specify procedures to allow Participants to make elections as to the deemed investment of
amounts in Investment Options in accordance with Section 4.1(a)(2). Nothing in this Section 4.1 or otherwise in the
Plan, however , will require Walmart to actually invest any amounts in such Investment Options or otherwise.
4.2 Incentive Payments.
The Incentive Payments described below will be credited to a Participant’ s Account. A Participant’ s entitlement to an
Incentive Payment will be governed by this Section 4.2.
(a) The Incen tive Paym ents provided in this Section apply to a Participant’ s recognized Deferred Compensation and
Deferred Bonuses for a Plan Year (other than Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses allocated to the
Participant’ s Scheduled In-Service Acco unts) and credited Plan earnings thereon, whether credited to the Participant’ s
Account or Grandfathered Account. For this purpose, Deferred Bonuses shall be treated as being “for a Plan Year” for
the Plan Year to which the Deferred Bonus pertains. Incentive Payments are separately awarded based upon a
Participant’ s recogn ized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for a given Plan Year and credited Plan
earnings thereon.
(b) The amount of an Incentive Payment is based on the Participant’ s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred
Bonuses for a Plan Year (other than Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses allocated to the Participant’ s
Scheduled In-Servic e Accounts), plus credited Plan earnings on such sums through and including the Incentive
Payment award date. The amount by which a Participant’ s Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for a Plan
Year (othe r than Deferred Compensatio n and Deferred Bonuses allocated to the Participant’ s Scheduled In-Service
Accounts) exceed twenty percent (20%)  of the Participant’ s base compensation will not be recognized in computing
an Incentive Payment. Base compensati on for this purpose means the Participant’ s annual base rate of compensation
for the last full payroll period in such Plan
15
Year. Credited Plan earnings on such nonrecognized Deferred Compensation or Deferred Bonuses are likewise not
taken into account in determining the amount of an Incentive Payment. Further , in no event shall Deferred Special
Bonuses, Deferred Retention Bonuses, Deferred Equity or any Employer Contribution Credits be taken into account
in determining the amount of an Incentive Payment.
(c) If a Participant rema ins continuously employed with Walmart or any Employer for a period of ten (10) consecutive
full Plan Years, beginning with the first day of the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a Deferred
Compensation or Deferred Bonus election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the last day
of the tenth (10) Plan Year of such period, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Partici pant’ s Account as of
the last day of such tenth (10) Plan Year. The Incentive Payment will be equal to twenty percent (20%) of the
Participant’ s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for ten (10), but not less than five (5), Plan
Years (i.e., the first six (6) Plan Years of such ten (10)-year period), plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the
award date. For each full Plan Year thereafter in which the Participant remains continuously employed with Walmart
or any Employer , an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’ s Account as of the last day of such Plan
Year. Such Incentive Payment will be equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Participant’ s recognized Deferred
Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for the first Plan Year of the five (5)-consecutive Plan Year period ending on the
award date, plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the award date.
(d) If a Participant remains continuously employed with Walmart or any Employer for a period of fifteen (15)
consecutive full Plan Years, beginning with the first day of the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a Deferred
Compensation or Deferred Bonus election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the last day
of the fifteenth (15) Plan Year of such period, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Partici pant’ s Account as
of the last day of such fifteenth (15) Plan Year. The Incentive Payment will be equal to ten percent (10%) of the
Participant’ s recogn ized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for fifteen (15), but not less than ten (10),
Plan Years (i.e., the first six (6) Plan Years of such fifteen (15)-year period) , plus credited Plan earnings thereon
through the award date. For each full Plan Year thereafter in which the Participant remains continuously employed
with Walmart or any Employer , an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’ s Account as of the last day
of such Plan Year. Such Incentive Payment will be equal to ten percent (10%) of the Participant’ s recognized Deferred
Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for the first Plan Year of the ten (10)-consecutive Plan Year period ending on
the award date, plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the award date. The Incentive Payments provided in this
Section 4.2(d) shall not take into account Incentive Payments credited under Section 4.2(c) or credited Plan earnings
thereon.th

th
th
16
(e) The Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(e) only apply if a Participant has been a Participant under the
Plan (or a Prior Agre ement) for five (5) or more full Plan Years and if the Participant dies, becomes Disabled, or has a
Separation from Service on or after he or she has been continuously employe d with Walmart or an Employer for
twenty (20) or more years or after attain ing age fifty-five (55) before satisfactio n of the ten (10)-year or fifteen (15)-
year periods described in Sections 4.2(c ) and (d) above, after taking into account the application of Section 4.2(f). In
that event,  only the Incentive Payment next to be credited (i.e., twenty percent (20%) or ten percent (10%)) will be
credited to the Participant’ s Account as provided in this Section 4.2(e). In the event the Participant had not yet been
awarded or credited with a twenty percent (20%) Incentive Payment under Section 4.2(c), the Incentive Payment
provided by this Section 4.2(e) will be based upon the ratio of: (1) the number of full Plan Years worked since and
including the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a Deferred Compensation or Deferred Bonus election in
effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, to (2) ten (10), multiplied by twenty percent (20%). Such Incentive
Payment will be based upon recognized  amounts for the Plan Years which would otherwise have been considered in
calculating the Participant’ s first Incentive Payment under Section 4.2(c). If the Participant has been awarded a
twenty percent (20%) Incentive Paymen t provided in Section 4.2(c), the Incentive Payment provided by this Section
4.2(e) will be based  upon the ratio of: (1) the number of full Plan Years work ed since the award date of the initial
twenty percent (20%) Incentive Payment, to (2) five (5), multiplied by ten percent (10%). Such Incentive Payment
will be based upon recognized amounts for the Plan Years which would otherwis e have been considered in calculating
the Partici pant’ s first Incentive Payment under Section 4.2(d). The Incentive Payment provided under this Section
4.2(e) will be determined and credited to the Participant’ s Account as of the date the Participant’ s Plan benefits are
distributed in a lump sum payment. In addition, the Participant’ s Account will also be credited as of such date with
interest pursuant to Section 4.1 determined as though the Incentive Payment provided under this Section 4.2(e) had
been credited to the Participant’ s Account on the last day of the Plan Year preceding the Participant’ s death, Disability
or Separation from Service. If, however , a Participant’ s benefits are to be distributed in installments, the amounts
provided under this Section 4.2(e) will be determined and credited to the Partic ipant’ s Account as of the distribution
date of the initial installment.
(f) This Section 4.2(f) shall not apply with respect to Plan Years beginning after March 31, 2009. With respect to Plan
Years beginning before March 31, 2009, the Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(f) apply only with
respect to those Participants who: (1) incur a Separation from Service on or after the last day of a Fiscal Year, but
before the immediately following last day of a Plan Year (e.g., on or after January 31, but before the next March 31);
and (2) who, but for such Separation from Service before the last day of a Plan Year, would have been credited with
an Incentive Payment under Section 4.2(c) and/or 4.2(d). In that event, the Incentive Payments which would have
been credited to the Participant’ s Account but for such early Separation from Service will be
17
credited to the Participant’ s Account as if the Participant had remained employed with Walmart or any Employer
through the last day of the Plan Year, with no reduction due to the early Separation from Service. The Incentive
Payments provided under this Section 4.2(f) will be determined and credited to the Participant’ s Account as of the last
day of the Plan Year in which the Participant’ s Separation from Service occurs.

(1) If the Participant’ s Account is to be distributed in the form of annual installme nts, the first such installment
shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on the first January 31 coincident with or next following
the Participant’ s death. Subsequent insta llments will be made during the 90-day period commencing on each
successive January 31, until the Participant’ s benefits are distributed in full.
(2) If any portion of a Participant’ s Accoun t is being credited with interest at the Interest Rate in accordance with
Section 4.1(a)(1) as of the applicable Valuation Date, such portion will be paid in equal annual installments in
an amount which would fully amortiz e a loan equal to the lump sum value of the Participant’ s Account
determined in accordance with Section 5.3(b)(2) (using as the distribution date the date of the first installment)
over the installment period, with interest calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which
the Participant’ s death occurs.
(3) If any portion of a Participant’ s Accoun t is being credited with earnings, gains and losses in accordance with
Section 4.1(a)(2) as of the applicable Valuation Date, such portion will be paid in substantially equal annual
installments equal to the quotient of (A) the total remaining balance in the applicable portion as of the
Valuation Date immediately prior to the date on which such installment payment is scheduled to be paid,
divided by (B) the number of installment payments remaining in the applicable period of annual installments.
(d) Death After  Commencement of Insta llments.  Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event of a Participant’ s death
after insta llment payments to the Partici pant have commenced, such installment payments shall continue to be made
to the Participant’ s designated beneficia ry in the same manner as they were being distributed to the Participant prior
to his or her death, provided, however , that if the Participant’ s distribution election applicable to Section 5.3(a) is a
lump sum payment, the Participant’ s remaining installments will be distributed in lump sum to the Participant’ s
designated beneficiary within the 90-day period commencing on the last day of the month in which the Participant’ s
death occurs.
(e) Designation of Beneficiary . A Participant may, by written or electronic instrument delivered to the Committee in the
form presc ribed by the Committee, designate primary and contingent beneficiaries (which may be a trust or trusts) to
receive any benefit payments which may be payable under this Plan following the Participant’ s death, and may
designate the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payments. Any such designation will apply
to both the Participant’ s Account and his or her Grandfathered Account, if any; a Participant may not designate
different beneficiaries for his or her Account and
20
Grandfathered Account. A Participant may change such designation from time to time and the last designation filed
with the Committee in accordance with its procedures prior to the Participant’ s death will control. For this purpose, a
Participant’ s most recent beneficiary designation properly filed under a Prior Agreement shall continue to be given
effect until otherwise modified in accordance with the provisions of this Section. In the event no beneficiary is
designated, or if all designated benefic iaries predecease the Participant, payment shall be payable to the following

known to the Comm ittee, if any; (2) the Participant’ s living children known to the Committee in equal shares; (3) the
Participant’ s living parents known to the Committee in equal shares; (4) the Participant’ s surviving siblings known to

benefits that would have been paid to such beneficiary shall continue in the same form in equal shares to the
remaining beneficia ries at the same level (i.e., primary , contingent) and, if none, to the next level of beneficiaries. If
there are no beneficiaries at the next level, then any remaining benefits shall be paid to the following “default”
beneficiaries of the last living beneficiary in the following order of priority: (1) the beneficiary’ s surviving spouse
known to the Comm ittee, if any; (2) the beneficiary’ s living children known to the Committee in equal shares; (3) the
beneficiary’ s surviv ing parents known to the Committee in equal shares; (4) the beneficiary’ s surviving siblings
known to the Committee in equal shares; or (5) the beneficiary’ s estate for distribution in accordance with the terms
of the beneficiary’ s last will and testament or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine.
5.4 Form of Distribution.
(a) Forms Available.  If a Participant’ s Separation from Service is on account of the Participant’ s Retirement or is due to
death, distribution of his or her Compa ny Account and Retirement Accounts or, in the event of death, his or her
Account, may be made, at the Participant’ s election per this Section 5.4, in one of the following forms:
(1) a lump sum;
(2) subject to the minimum account value restriction below , substantially equal annual installments over a period
not to exceed fifteen (15) years; or
(3) solely with respect to distribution of the Participant’ s Account in the event of death, partially a lump sum and,
subject to the minim um account value restriction below , substantially equal annual installments over a period
not to exceed fifteen (15) years;
21
provided, however , that an installment election will be given effect only if, as of the date on which any lump sum
payment would be valued, the value of the Participant’ s Company Account or Retirement Account, as applicable, or
in the event of death, Account, is at least fifty-thousand dollars ($50,000). Any Participant whose Company Account
or Retirement Account, as applicable, or in the event of death, Account, is valued at less than fifty-thousand dollars
($50,000) as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued shall be defaulted to a lump sum payment.
(b) Retir ement Accounts .
(1) The Accou nt balance of a Participant as of December 31, 2008 shall, as of such date, be allocated to his or her
Retirement Accounts in a manner determined by Executive Compensation to be consistent with his or her last
affirmative form of payment election filed with Executive Compensation on or before December 31, 2008;
provided, however , that in no event may any such election made in 2008 defer any amount otherwise payable
during 2008 to 2009 or any later year or accelerate any amount otherwise payable during 2009 or any later
year into 2008. (Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event a Participant’ s affirmative form of payment
outstanding on December 31, 2008 is an “account balance-driven” election, the Participant’ s Account shall be
allocated as of such date in accordance with his or her election, as though distribution would occur on
December 31, 2008.) Deferrals (including Employer Contribution Credits and Incentive Payments) credited to
the Participant’ s Account after Decembe r 31, 2008 and through March 31, 2009  shall also be allocated to the
Participant’ s Retirem ent Accounts in accordance with such election. Any form of payment election filed
during 2008 shall be deemed to have been made under applicable Internal Revenue Service transition relief
(and thus shall not be subject to Secti ons 5.4(d)(1), (d)(2) and (d)(3)), unless the Participant specifically
waives such transition relief. Any distribution election made after December 31, 2008 shall be subject to
Section 5.4(d).
(2) With respect to any individual who is a Participant as of December 31, 2008, Incentive Payments credited
after Marc h 31, 2009, if any, will be allocated to his or her Retirement Accounts in accordance with his or her
last affirmative form  of payment election filed with Executive Compensation  on or before December 31,
2008, which election may be separate from the election provided in Section 5.4(b)(1) above. Such election
shall be irrevocable as of December 31, 2008.
(c) Company Account . A Participant’ s Com pany Account shall be paid in the form of a lump sum, unless the Participant
makes a subsequent distribution election in accordance with Section 5.4(d).
(d) Subsequent Elections . A Partici pant may change his or her distribution election (or deemed distribution election)
with respect to his or her Company Account or Retirement Account or , in the event of death, his or her Account, per
22
this Section 5.4 at any time by making a new election (referred to in this subsection as a “subsequent election”) on a
form (which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation and filed with Executive Compensation;
provided, however , that each such subsequent election shall be subject to the following restrictions:
(1) A subsequ ent election made after December 31, 2008 may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months
after the date on which such subsequent election is made;
(2) Payment or initial payment pursuant to a subsequent election made after Decem ber 31, 2008 may not be made
earlier than five (5) years from the date such payment would have been made absent the subsequent election
(but, for this purpose, installment payments shall not commence until the first January 31 after such delay),
unless the distribution is made on account of the Participant’ s death;
(3) A subsequent election made after Decem ber 31, 2008 related to a payment must be made not less than twelve
(12) months before the date the payment is scheduled to be paid;
(4) Payment of a Partic ipant’ s Company Account or Retirement Account or, in the event of death, Account,
pursuant to a subsequent election must  be completed by the last day of the Plan Year which contains the
twentieth (20 ) anniversary of the Participant’ s Separation Pay Date or the Participant’ s death;
(5) For purposes of this Section 5.4(d) and Code Section 409A, the entitlement to annual installment payments is
treated as the entitlement to a single payment;
(6) A Particip ant may make more than one subsequent election; provided, however , that any Participant who
makes a form of payment election during 2008 and who elects to waive transition relief as provided in Section
5.4(b)(1) shall not be permitted to make  a subsequent election after December 31, 2008 with respect to his or
her Retirement Accounts.
If a Participant’ s distribution election does not satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(d), it will not be recognized
or given effect by the Committee. In that event, distribution of the benefit will be made in accordance with the
Participant’ s most recent distribution election which does satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(d).
(e) Filing of Election . A Participant’ s distribution elections under Section 5.2(b) or 5.3(a) must be filed with Executive
Compensation on forms (which may be electronic) prescribed by Executive Compensation.th
23
5.5 Distributions for  Unfor eseeable Emergencies.
(a) In the event of an Unforeseeable Emer gency , the Committee or its delegate, in its sole and absolute discretion and
upon written application of a Participant or, following the Participant’ s death, the beneficiary to whom a Participant’ s
benefits are then being paid, or will be paid, pursuant to Section 5.3, may direct immediate distribution of all or a
portion of the Participant’ s Account (other than Employer Contribution Credits and Incentive Payments). The
Committee or its delegate will permit distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emer gency only to the extent
reasonably necessary to satisfy the emer gency need, plus amounts necessary to pay federal, state or local income
taxes and penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which
such need is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance, by liquidation of the
Participant’ s or beneficiary’ s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial
hardship), or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. Any distribution under this Section 5.5 shall first be made from
the Partic ipant’ s Scheduled In-Service  Accounts (including earnings thereon), then from his or her Retirement
Accounts (including  earnings thereon) in the following order: Deferred Equity, Deferred Special Bonuses and
Deferred Retention Bonuses, then pro rata from Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonus. A Participant’ s
Incentive Payments under Section 4.2 shall be ratably adjusted consistent with the above.
(b) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary , if Walmart reasonably anticipates that its deduction with respect
to any distribution under this Section 5.5 would not be permitted due to the application of Code Section 162(m); such
payment shall be suspended to the extent a deduction would not be permitt ed until the earliest date at which it
reasonably anticipates that the deduction of such distribution would not be barred by application of Code Section
162(m); provided, however , that the conditions of Section 5.5(a) are still satisfied as of such date.
5.6 Reductions Arising fr om a Participant’ s Gross Misconduct.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , a Participant’ s Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not
engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart or any Employer or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership
interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’ s Statement of Ethics. In the event the Committee determines that
the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding any provisions hereunder to
the contrary: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Employer Contribution Credits and Incentive Payments, and credited Plan earnings
thereon; (b) earnings credited to the Participant’ s Account derived from Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses, Deferred
Special Bonuses, Deferred Retention Bonuses and Deferred Equity shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amount
which would otherwise have been credi ted if the applicable Interest Rate (or if a portion of the Participant’ s Account derived from
such sourc es is being credited with earnings, gains and losses, the positive earnings rate (if any) for such Plan Year) were fifty
percent (50%) of the Interest Rate in ef fect (or positive earnings rate, as applicable) for such Plan Year; and (c) if the Participant
24
is then receiving installment payments, any remaining installments shall be recalculated to reflect the amount which would
otherwise have been paid if the applicable Interest Rate (or positive earnings rate, as applicable) were fifty percent (50%) of the
Interest Rate in effect (or positive earnings rate, as applicable) with respect to such installment payments. For the avoidance of
doubt, if a portion of a Participant’ s Account is being credited with earnings, gains and losses and such portion experiences a net
loss for a Plan Year, such net loss shall not be adjusted as a result of the Participant’ s engaging in Gross Misconduct under this
Section 5.6. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the Participant’ s Deferred Compensation, Deferred
Bonuses, Deferred Special Bonuses, Deferred Retention Bonuses or Deferred Equity as a result of the Participant’ s engaging in
Gross Misconduct under this Section 5.6. Any payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant’ s beneficiary) are
contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart or any
Employer or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or durin g such additional period as provided in Walmart’ s
Statement of Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts hereunder , that the Participant has engaged in Gross
Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant’ s beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart any amount in
excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.6.

ARTICLE I.
GENERAL
1.1    Purpose.
    The purpose of the Walmart Inc. Officer Deferred Compensation Plan (“Plan”) is to: (a) attract and retain the valuable services of
certain officers; (b) recognize, reward, and encourage contributions by such officers to the success of Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) and
its Related  Affiliates; and (c) enable such officers to defer certain compensatio n and bonuses, and to be credited with earnings and
Incentive Payments with respect to such amounts.
1.2    Applicability to Prior  Deferr ed Compensation Agreements; Effective Date.
    This Plan was initially effective February l, 1996 with respect to compensation and bonuses deferred (and credited earnings
thereon) under the Plan on or after February 1, 1996. In addition, prior to February 1, 1995, certain Eligible Officers entered into
deferred compensation agreements (“Prior Agreements”) with Walmart containing terms similar to those contained in this Plan.
Except as expressly provided herein, effective February 1, 1996 the Prior Agreements were amended and restated in the form of this
Plan.
    The Plan as initially adopted effective  February 1, 1996, was amended from time-to-time, most recently by Amendment No. Three
to the February 1, 1997 amended and restated Plan. The effective date of this amended and restated Plan is March 31, 2003, except
as otherwise expressly provided herein.
1.3    Natur e of Plan.
    The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of
management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(“ERISA”). The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments
30
under the Plan shall be made solely from  the general assets of Walmart and, to the extent such payments or benefits are attributable
to services with a respective Related Affiliate or Related Affiliates, such Related Affiliate or Related Affiliates. For this purpose,
payments or benefits under the Plan are deemed to be attributable to services with the last Related Affiliate by whom the Participant
was employed at or prior to the time benefits become payable under Article  V. A Participant’ s interests under the Plan do not
represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Related Affiliate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a
trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between Walmart, any Related Affiliate or the Committee, and a Participant, the
Participant’ s beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart or a
Related Affiliate under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart or such
Related Affiliate.

(o)    Retir ement means a Participant’ s Termination of Employment on or after the Participant’ s attainment of age fifty-five
(55).
(p)    Termination of Employment means a Participant  ceasing to be actively employed by Walmart and its Related
Affiliates. Terminati on of Employment does not include the transfer of a Participant from the employ of Walmart to a
Related Affiliate or vice versa , a transfer  between Walmart’ s Related Affiliates, or periods while a Participant is on an
approved leave of absence.
(q)    Unfor eseeable Emergency means a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from a sudd en and
unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or a Participant’ s dependent (as defined in Code Section 152(a)), the
loss of the Participant’ s property due to casualty , or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances
arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. An Unforesee able Emer gency does not exist to the
extent such hardship is or may be relieved:
(1)    through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise;
(2)    by liquidation of the Participant’ s assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would itself not cause severe
financial hardship; or
(3)    by cessation of deferrals under this Plan.
The need to send a Participant’ s child to college or the desire to purchase a home does not constitute an Unforeseeable
Emer gency . The existence of an Unforeseeable Emer gency will be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, based
upon the Participant’ s facts and circumstance and in accordance with restrictions imposed by the Code or guidance
thereunder .
    (r)    Annual Valuation Date means the last day of each Plan Year.

ARTICLE III.
DEFERRED COMPENSA TION AND BONUSES--
ESTABLISHMENT  OF ACCOUNTS
3.1    Deferr ed Compensation.
    For each Plan Year, each Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of what would otherwise be the Eligible Officer’s
federal taxable base compensation, net of employment taxes and estimated bi-weekly deductions as are determined to be in effect on
the first day of the deferral period, to be paid for such Plan Year by Walmart or a Related Affiliate designated by Walmart as a
participating employer . Amounts deferre d (the “Deferred Compensation”) will be deferred pro ratably for each payroll period of the
Plan Year. All deferral elections made under this Section 3.1 must be filed with the Committee on forms approved by the Committee.
Deferral elections must be (a) filed no later than the day preceding the Plan Year for which the deferral election is to be effective; or
(b) with respect to an Eligible Officer appointed during the Plan Year, within thirty (30) days of such appointment. Individuals
appointed as Eligible Officers on or after April 1, 2003 and before October 1, 2003 shall have thirty (30) days from such latter date
to file a deferral election for the balance of the Plan Year.
    Once made for a Plan Year, a deferral  election may not be revoked, changed or modified. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
in the event an Eligible Officer ceases to be employed as an Eligible Officer, such former Eligible Officer’s deferral election shall
automatically cease with respect to compensation earned on or after the individual ceases to be an Eligible Officer. A deferral
election for one (1) Plan Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if deferrals are desired for a
subsequent Plan Year, a separate electio n must be made by the Eligible Officer for such Plan Year. An Eligible Officer’s deferral
election shall remain  in effect with respect to any portion of base compensation paid while on a leave of absence, and, if the leave of
absence is unpaid, shall resume upon return from the leave of absence during the same Plan Year and shall continue in effect for the
balance of such Plan Year.
3.2    Deferr ed Bonuses.
    Each Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s bonus (if any) for a Fiscal Year under the Walmart
Inc. Management Incentive Plan for Officers. All bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.2 must be made on forms
approved by the Committee, and be filed with the Committee: (a) for the 1996-1997 Fiscal Year, no later than January 31, 1996; (b)
for Fiscal Years beginning on or after February 1, 1997, no later than the March 31 of the Fiscal Year for which such bonus (if any)
is payable; and (c) within thirty (30) days of the individual’ s appointment as an Eligible Officer if the Eligible Officer is newly
appointed after March 31 of the Fiscal Year. Individuals appointed as Eligible Officers on or after April 1, 2003 and before October
1, 2003 shall have thirty (30) days from such latter date to file a bonus deferral election with respect to the February 1, 2003 -
January 31, 2004 Fiscal Year.
    Once made for a Fiscal Year, a bonus  deferral election may not be revoked, changed or modified. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, in the event an Eligible Officer ceases to be employed as an Eligible Officer but remains employed by Walmart or by one
of its Related Affiliates, such former Eligible Officer’s bonus deferral election shall automatically cease with respect to that portion
of a bonus earned on or after the date the individual ceases to be an
34
Eligible Officer. For this purpose, the portion of a bonus earned on or after ceasing to be an Eligible Officer shall be determined by
multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such Fiscal Year in which the
individual ceased to be an Eligible Officer, and the denominator of which is the total calendar days in such Fiscal Year. Effective for
those bonuses payable for Fiscal Years beginning on or after February 1, 2003, in the event an Eligible Officer ceases to be
employed as an Eligible Officer due to a Termination of Employment, or if an Eligible Officer takes an approved leave of absence,
such Eligi ble Officer’s bonus deferral election shall remain in effect with respect to that portion of a bonus earned while an Eligible
Officer, even if such bonus is awarded after a Termination of Employment or while an Eligible Officer is on an approved leave of
absence.
    With respect to those Eligible Officers appointed on or after the first day of a Plan Year and who elect to defer all or a portion of
their bonus (if any) for that initial Fisca l Year, such deferral elections shall apply only to that portion of the bonus earned after the
date of such election, by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such Fiscal
Year in which the individual elected to defer all or a portion of their bonus after first becoming appointed as an Eligible Officer, and
the denominator of which is the total calendar days in such Fiscal Year. A bonus deferral election for one (1) Fiscal Year will not
automatically be given effect for a subsequent Fiscal Year, so that if deferrals are desired for a subsequent Fiscal Year, a separate
election must be made by the Eligible Of ficer for such Fiscal Year.
3.3    Establishment of Grandfather ed Accounts.
    The Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses, and Incentive Payments will be credited to a bookkeeping account
(“Grandfathered Account”) established by the Committee on behalf of each Participant. The Deferred Compensation will be credited
to the Participant’ s Grandfathered Acco unt as of the last day of the Plan Year during which the Deferred Compensation would
otherwise be payable to the Participant.  The Deferred Bonus will be credited to the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the
date the bonus would have otherwise been paid in cash. The Incentive Payments will be credited to the Participant’ s Grandfathered
Account as of the last day of the Plan Year specified in Section 4.2. A Participant’ s Grandfathered Account, including earnings
credited thereto, will be maintained by the Committee until the Participant’ s Plan benefits have been paid in full.
3.4    Natur e of Grandfather ed Accounts.
    Each Participant’ s Grandfathered Account will be used solely as a measu ring device to determine the amount to be paid a
Participant under this Plan. The Grandfathered Accounts do not constitute, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of any
kind. All amounts at any time attributable to a Participant’ s Grandfathered Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart
and its Related Affiliates. A Participant’ s rights hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein. The
Plan represents an unsecured promise by Walmart and the applicable Related Affiliate to pay the benefits provided by the Plan.
35
3.5    Annual Valuation of Grandfather ed Accounts.
    Each  Participant’ s Grandfathered Account will be valued annually as of each Annual Valuation Date. The value of an
Grandfathered Acco unt as of any applicable Annual Valuation Date is the sum of the Grandfathered Account value as of the
immediately preceding Annual Valuatio n Date, the Deferred Compensation, Deferred Bonuses and Incentive Payments allocated as
of the applicable Annual Valuation Date, and the equivalent of interest credited to the Grandfathered Account under Section 4.1 as of
the applic able Annual Valuation Date, less any distributions for Unforeseeable Emer gencies since the preceding Annual Valuation
Date but on or before the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
[Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , effective April 1, 2008, Grandfathered Accounts shall be credited with interest on a
daily basis. The amount of interest to be credited each day shall be a daily rate of simple interest based on the interest rate in effect
for the Plan Year as provided in Section 4.1 (the “Interest Rate”). Also, effective January 1, 2009, the Plan Year for such purpose
shall be the twelve-month period Febru ary 1 through January 31, with the period April 1, 2009 through January 31, 2010 being a
short Plan Year. This Appendix A shall be construed in accordance with such modifications. It has been determined that these
modifications do not constitute “material modifications” for purposes of Code Section 409A.]
[Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , effective for Plan Years commencing on or after February 1, 2023, a Participant’ s
Grandfathered Account will be credited with either of the following, as elected by the Participant in accordance with this provision:
(a)    Interest at the Interest Rate; or
(b)    Earnings, gains and losses based on the results that would have been achieved had amounts credited to the
Grandfathered Account been invested as soon as practicable after such election into the Investment Options (as
defined in the Plan) selected by the Participant.
The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall establish one or more windows of time during which a Participant may irrevocably elect
for all or a portion of his or her Grandfathered Account to be credited with earnings, gains and losses in accordance with paragraph
(b) above. If a Participant does not make  such an election in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee in its sole
discretion, the Participant’ s entire Grandfathered Account shall be credited with interest in accordance with paragraph (a) above.
Once earnings are elected under paragr aph (b) above with respect to any portion of a Participant’ s Grandfathered Account, such
Participant shall be prohibited from subsequently electing to receive interest with respect to such portion in accordance with
paragraph (a) above.
The Comm ittee shall specify procedures to allow Participants to make elections as to the deemed investment of amounts in
Investment Options  (as defined in the Plan) in accordance with this provisi on. Nothing in this provision or otherwise in this
Appendix A, however , will require Walmart to actually invest any amounts in such Investment Options or otherwise.
If a portion of a Participant’ s Grandfath ered Account is being credited with earnings, gains and losses in accordance with paragraph
(b) above and such portion is payable in a lump sum under this Appendix A, then notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary ,
the lump sum amount
36
will be the value of such portion as of the last day of the month preceding the date of the distribution.
If a portion of a Participant’ s Grandfath ered Account is being credited with earnings, gains and losses in accordance with paragraph
(b) above and such portion is payable in installments under this Appendix A, then notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary ,
such porti on will be paid in substantiall y equal annual installments equal to the quotient of (A) the total remaining balance of such
portion as of the day immediately prior to the date on which such installment payment is scheduled to be paid, divided by (B) the
number of installment payments remaining in the applicable period of annual installments.
This Appendix A shall be construed in accordance with the above modifications. It has been determined that these modifications do
not constitute “material modifications” for purposes of Code Section 409A.]
ARTICLE IV .
ADDITIONS TO ACCOUNTS -- CREDITED EARNINGS
AND INCENTIVE P AYMENTS
4.1    Cr edited Annual Earnings.
    For each Plan Year a Participant’ s Grandfathered Account will be credited with the equivalent of interest at the per annum rate
established for such Plan Year by the Committee; provided, however , for the February 1, 1997 - March 31, 1997 Plan Year, the
equivalent of interest shall be credited at one-sixth (1/6) of the per annum rate so established for such period. The per annum rate
may be increased or decreased for any Plan Year to reflect changes in prevailing interest rates, as determined at the sole discretion of
the Committee. Except for a Plan Year in which a Participant receives a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emer gency , the amount
to be credited to a Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of any Annual Valuation Date is the sum of: (a) the applicable per annum
rate multip lied by the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account value as of the immediately preceding Annual Valuation Date; (b) fifty
percent (50%) of the Participant’ s Defer red Compensation for the Plan Year ending on the Annual Valuation Date multiplied by the
applicable full annum rate; and (c) effective for Deferred Bonuses attributable to Fiscal Years beginning on or after February 1,
2003, a pro rata amount of interest equivalent at the applicable per annum rate based upon the number of days from the date such
bonus would have otherwise been paid in cash through the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
[NOTE : The annual rate in effect for a Plan Year for this purpose shall be determined in accordance with the following formula in
effect as of October  3, 2004: the rate on 10-year Treasury notes determined as of the first business day of January preceding each
Plan Year, plus 270 basis points. Such formula shall not be modified on or after October 3, 2004. Notwithstanding the preceding, in
light of uncertainty regarding whether adjustment of the annual rate would constitute a material modification of the Plan for Code
Section 409A purpo ses, the annual rate was not adjusted for 2005. The annual rate for 2006 and future years will be adjusted in
accordance with the above formula.]
37
    For a Plan Year in which a Participant receives a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emer gency , the amount to be credited to the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the applicable Annual Valuation Date is the sum of: (a) an equivalent amount of pro rata
interest on the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account value as of the preceding Annual Valuation Date based upon the number of full
calendar months in the Plan Year which the Grandfathered Account was not reduced due to the distribution; (b) an equivalent amount
of pro rata interest on the Grandfathered Account value immediately after the distribution based upon the number of calendar months
in the Plan Year in which the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account was reduced;  (c) fifty percent (50%) of the Participant’ s Deferred
Compensation for the Plan Year ending on the Annual Valuation Date multiplied by the applicable full annum rate; and (d) effective
for Deferred Bonuses attributable to Fiscal Years beginning on or after February  1, 2003, a pro rata amount of interest equivalent at
the applic able per annum rate based upon the number of days from the date such bonus would have otherwise been paid in cash
through the applicable Annual Valuation Date.
4.2    Incentive Payments.
    The Incentive Payments described below will be credited to a Participant’ s Grandfathered Account. Incentive Payments awarded
and credite d to a Participant’ s Grandfathered Account under a Prior Agreement (such Incentive Payments were previously referred to
as “incentive bonuses” under the Prior Agreements), and credited interest thereon, will remain credited to a Participant’ s
Grandfathered Acco unt hereunder as of January 31, 1996. Thereafter , a Participant’ s entitlement to an Incentive Payment will be
governed by this Section 4.2, including any Incentive Payment which may be awarded with respect to recognized Deferred
Compensation (and credited earnings thereon) deferred under a Prior Agreemen t. Incentive Payments hereunder shall not duplicate
any Incentive Payment awarded and credited under a Prior Agreement as of January 31, 1996.
(a)    The Incentiv e Payments provided in this Section apply to a Participa nt’s recognized Deferred Compensation and
Deferred Bonuses for a Plan Year and credited Plan earnings thereon. For this purpose, Deferred Bonuses shall be
treated as being “for a Plan Year” for the Plan Year in which Deferred Bonuses are allocated to a Participant’ s
Grandfathered Acco unt under Section 3.3. Incentive Payments are separately  awarded based upon a Participant’ s
recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for a given Plan Year and credited Plan earnings thereon.
Solely for purposes of this Section 4.2, the February 1, 1996 - January 31, 1997 Plan Year and the short February 1,
1997 - March 31, 1997 Plan Year shall be treated as one Plan Year running from February 1, 1996 - March 31, 1997.
(b)    The amount of an Incentive Payment is based on the Participant’ s recog nized Deferred Compensation and Deferred
Bonuses for a Plan Year, plus credited Plan earnings on such sums through and including the Incentive Payment
award date. The amount by which a Participant’ s Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for a Plan Year
exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Participant’ s base compensation will not be recognized in computing an
Incentive Payment. Base compensation for this purpose means the Participant’ s annual base rate of compensation for
such Plan Year (proportionately increased for the special Plan
38
Year of February 1, 1996 - March 31, 1997). Credited Plan earnings on such nonrecognized Deferred Compensation
or Deferred Bonuses are likewise not taken into account in determining the amount of an Incentive Payment.
(c)    If a Participant remains continu ously employed with Walmart or its Related Affiliates for a period of ten (10)
consecutive full Plan Years, beginning with the first day of the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a Deferred
Compensation or Deferred Bonus election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the last day
of the tenth (10th) Plan Year of such period, an Incentive Payment will be credi ted to the Participant’ s Grandfathered
Account as of the last day of such tenth 10th Plan Year. The Incentive Payment will be equal to twenty percent (20%)
of the Participant’ s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for ten (10), but not less than five (5),
Plan Years (i.e., the first six (6) Plan Years of such ten (10)-year period), plus credited Plan earnings thereon through
the award date. For each full Plan Year thereafter in which the Participant remains continuously employed with
Walmart or its Related Affiliates, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as
of the last day of such Plan Year. Such Incentive Payment will be equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Participant’ s
recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for the first Plan Year of the five (5)-consecutive Plan Year
period ending on the award date, plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the award date.
(d)    If a Participant remains continuo usly employed with Walmart or its Related Affiliates for a period of fifteen (15)
consecutive full Plan Years, beginning with the first day of the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a Deferred
Compensation or Deferred Bonuses election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, and ending with the last
day of the fifteenth  (15th) Plan Year of such period, an Incentive Payment will be credited to the Participant’ s
Grandfathered Account as of the last day of such fifteenth (15th) Plan Year. The Incentive Payment will be equal to
ten percent (10%) of the Participant’ s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for fifteen (15), but
not less than ten (10), Plan Years (i.e., the first six (6) Plan Years of such fifteen  (15)-year period), plus credited Plan
earnings thereon through the award date. For each full Plan Year thereafter in which the Participant remains
continuously employed with Walmart or its Related Affiliates, an Incentiv e Payment will be credited to the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the last day of such Plan Year. Such Incentive Payment will be equal to ten
percent (10%) of the Participant’ s recognized Deferred Compensation and Deferred Bonuses for the first Plan Year of
a ten (10)-consecutive Plan Year period ending on the award date, plus credited Plan earnings thereon through the
award date. The Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(d) shall not take into account Incentive Payments
credited under Section 4.2(c) or credited Plan earnings thereon.
(e)    The Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(e) only apply if a Participant has been a Participant under the Plan
(or a Prior Agreement) for five (5) or more full Plan Years and if the Participant incurs a Retirement, Early
Retirement, death or Disability before satisfaction of the ten (10)- or fifteen (15)-year periods
39
described in Sections 4.2 (c) and (d) above, after taking into account the application of Section 4.2(f). In that event,
only the Incentive Payment next to be credited (i.e., twenty percent (20%) or ten percent (10%)) will be credited to
the Partici pant’ s Grandfathered Accoun t as provided in this Section 4.2(e). In the event the Participant had not yet
been awarded or credited with a twenty percent (20 %) Incentive Payment under Section 4.2(c), the Incentive
Payment provided by this Section 4.2(e ) will be based upon the ratio of (1) the number of full Plan Years worked
since and including  the first Plan Year in which the Participant had a Deferred Compensation or Deferred Bonus
election in effect under this Plan or a Prior Agreement, to (2) ten (10), multiplied by twenty percent (20%). Such
Incentive Payment will be based upon recognized amounts for the Plan Years which would otherwise have been
considered in calculating the Participant’ s first Incentive Payment under Secti on 4.2(c). If the Participant has been
awarded a twenty percent (20 %) Incentive Payment provided in Section 4.2 (c), the Incentive Payment provided by
this Section 4.2(e) will be based upon the ratio of (1) the number of full Plan Years worked since the award date of the
initial twenty percent (20%) Incentive Payment, to (2) five (5), multiplied by ten percent (10%). Such Incentive
Payment will be based upon recognized  amounts for the Plan Years which would otherwise have been considered in
calculating the Participant’ s first Incenti ve Payment under Section 4.2(d). The Incentive Payment provided under this
Section 4.2(e) will be determined and credited to the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the date the
Participant’ s Plan benefits are distributed in a lump sum payment. If, howev er, a Participant’ s benefits are to be
distributed in installments, the amounts provided under this Section 4.2(e) will be determined and credited to the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the January 31 on which installments are based.
(f)    The Incentive Payments provided in this Section 4.2(f) apply only with respect to those Participants who: (1) incur a
Termination of Employment on or after the last day of a Fiscal Year, but before the immediately following last day of
a Plan Year (e.g., on or after January 31, but before the next March 31); and (2) who, but for such Termination of
Employment before the last day of a Plan Year, would have been credited with an Incentive Payment under Section
4.2(c) and/or 4.2(d). In that event, the Incentive Payments which would have been credited to the Participant’ s
Grandfathered Acco unt but for such early Termination of Employment will be credited to the Participant’ s
Grandfathered Account as if the Participant had remained employed with Walmart or its Related Affiliates through the
last day of the Plan Year, with no reduction due to the early Termination of Employment. The Incentive Payments
provided under this Section 4.2(f) will be determined and credited to the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of
the date the Participant’ s Plan benefits are distributed in a lump sum payment. If, however , a Participant’ s benefits are
to be distributed in installments, the amounts provided under this Section 4.2(f) will be determined and credited to the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the January 31 on which installments are based..
40
[NOTE : Incentive Payments are frozen under this Appendix A. From and after January 1, 2005, all Incentive Payments shall
be made under the Plan, not this Appendix A.]
ARTICLE V.

5.2    Termination Benefits.
    (a)    General.

Disability or death, the Participant’ s Plan benefits will be distributed in a lump sum under Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.2(c), as
applicable, within sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar month in whic h the Termination of Employment occurs; provided,
however , that if the Participant’ s Termination of Employment occurs after the Participant has attained age fifty (50), the Participant’ s

account value restrictions of Section 5.6 below , in substantially equal annual installments under Section 5.2(e) over a period not to
exceed fifteen (15) years, in accordance  with the Participant’ s distribution election given effect under the provisions of Section 5.6
below .
    (b)    Termination on Last Business Day of Plan Year.
    If the Participant’ s Termination of Employment occurs on the last business day (excluding for this purpose, Saturday and Sunday)
of a Plan Year, the lump sum amount will be the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account, as determined
under Section 3.5, as of the Annual Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the Participant’ s Termination of
Employment and (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which
distribution occurs) on the amount deter mined in (1) through the date of distribution based upon the number of calendar days since
such Annual Valuation Date.
    (c)    Termination on Other Than Last Business Day of Plan Year.
    If the Participan t’s Termination of Employment occurs on a date other than the last business day (excluding for this purpose,
Saturday and Sunday) of a Plan Year, the lump sum amount will equal the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant’ s Grandfathered
Account as of the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding Termination  of Employment; (2) a pro rata amount of interest
equivalent (determined at the per annum  rate in effect for a Plan Year under Section 4.1) on the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account
value as of such immediately preceding Annual Valuation Date based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation
Date through the date of distribution; (3) the Participant’ s Deferred Compensation
41
for the Plan Year in which Termination of Employment occurs; (4) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined by
multiplying fifty percent (50%) of the amount determined in (3) by the applicable full annum rate in effect for a Plan Year under
Section 4.1) based upon the number of calendar days since the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding Termination of
Employment through the date of distribution; and (5) the Participant’ s Incentive Payments (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(f).
    (d)    Death.
    In the event of a Participant’ s death before full payment of Plan benefits under this Section 5.2, payment shall be made (or
continue to be made) to the Participant’ s beneficiary designated under Section 5.5 in accordance with Participant’ s separate election
for death benefits under Section 5.6, or, with respect to those Participants in pay status who die on or after October 1, 2003, if the
Participant did not designate a beneficiary under Section 5.5 or if no such beneficiary survives the Participant, payment shall be
made in the form of a lump sum to the Participant’ s estate.
    (e)    Installment Distributions.
    If distribution is to be made in the form of annual installments pursuant to Section 5.2(a), the Participant’ s installments will be
based upon the value of the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the January 31 coincident with or immediately following the
Participant’ s Termination of Employment. For this purpose, the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account value as of such January 31
shall be equal to the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the Annual Valuation Date immediately
preceding the Participant’ s Termination of Employment; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the applicable
per annum rate in effect for a Plan Year under Section 4.1) on the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account value as of such immediately
preceding Annual Valuation Date based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date through the January 31;
(3) the Participant’ s Deferred Compensation for the Plan Year in which Termination of Employment occurs; (4) the Participant’ s
Incentive Payments (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e) or Section 4.2(f); and (5) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent
(determined by multiplying fifty percent  (50%) of the amount determined in (3) by the applicable full annum rate in effect for a Plan
Year unde r Section 4.1) based upon the number of calendar days since the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding
Termination of Employment through such January 31.
    Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if the Participant’ s Termination of Employment occurs on a January 31 (excluding for
this purpose, Saturday and Sunday), the Participant’ s installments will be based  upon the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant’ s
Grandfathered Account as of the Annual Valuation Date immediately following the Participant’ s Termination of Employment; (2) a
pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the applicable per annum rate in effect for a Plan Year under Section 4.1) on the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Account value as of such immediately following Annual Valuation Date based upon the number of
calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date through the following January 31; and (3) the Participant’ s Incentive Payments (if
any) as provided in Section 4.2(e) or Section 4.2(f).
42
    The Plan benefit s determined above will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan
equal to such Plan benefits over the period covered by the installment period (such period commencing on the February 1 following
the January 31 on which the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account is valued under this Section), with interest calculated at the per
annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant’ s Termination of Employment occurs. The first installment will be
paid as of the January 31 following the Participant’ s Termination of Employment, and continue on each successive January 31 until
the Partici pant’ s benefits are distributed in full. For purposes of the preceding sentence, it is expressly provided that, if a Participant’ s
Termination of Employment occurs on a January 31, the first installment will be paid on the next-following January 31.
5.3    Retir ement, Early Retir ement, and Disability Benefits.
    (a)    General.
    In the event of a Participant’ s Termination of Employment due to the Participant’ s Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability , the
Participant’ s Plan benefits will be distrib uted in a lump sum or in substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed
fifteen (15) years, subject to the minimum account value restrictions of Section 5.6 below and in accordance with the Participant’ s
distribution election given ef fect under the provisions of Section 5.6 below .
    (b)    Lump Sum Distributions.
    If distribution is to be made in the form of a lump sum, the Participant’ s Plan benefits will be distributed within sixty (60) days
after the end of the calendar month in which the Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability occurs. If the Participant’ s Retirement,
Early Retirement or Disability occurs on the last business day (excluding for this purpose Saturday and Sunday) of a Plan Year, the
lump sum amount will be the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as
of the Annual Valuation Date coincident with or immediately following the Participant’ s Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability;
(2) a pro rata amoun t of interest equivale nt (determined at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which distribution occurs)
on the amount determined in (1) through the date of distribution based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual
Valuation Date; and (3) the Participant’ s Incentive Payment (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e).
    If the Participant’ s Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability occurs on a date other than the last business day (excluding for this

Grandfathered Account as of the Annual  Valuation Date immediately preceding Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability; (2) a pro

43
(determined by multiplying fifty percent  (50%) of the amount determined in (3) by the applicable full annum rate in effect for a Plan
Year under Section 4.1) based upon the number of calendar days since the Annu al Valuation Date immediately preceding Retirement,
Early Retirement or Disability through the date of distribution.
    (c)    Installment Distributions.
    If distri bution is to be made in the form of annual installments, the Participa nt’s installments will be based upon the value of the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the January 31 coincident with or immediately following the Participant’ s Retirement,
Early Retirement or Disability . For this purpose, the Participant’ s Grandfathered  Account value as of such January 31 shall be equal
to the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding the
Participant’ s Retirem ent, Early Retirement or Disability; (2) a pro rata amount  of interest equivalent (determined at the applicable
per annum rate in effect for a Plan Year under Section 4.1) on the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account value as of such immediately

for a Plan Year unde r Section 4.1) based  upon the number of calendar days since the Annual Valuation Date immediately preceding
Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability through such January 31.

Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the Annual Valuation Date immediately following the Participant’ s Retirement, Early
Retirement or Disability; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the applicable per annum rate in effect for a Plan
Year unde r Section 4.1) on the Participa nt’s Grandfathered Account value as of such immediately following Annual Valuation Date
based upon the number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date through the following January 31; and (3) the
Participant’ s Incentive Payments (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e) or Section 4.2(f).
    The Plan benefit s determined above will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan
equal to such Plan benefits over the period covered by the installment period (such period commencing on the February 1 following
the January 31 on which the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account is valued under this Section), with interest calculated at the per
annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant’ s Retiremen t, Early Retirement or Disability occurs. The first
installment will be paid as of the Januar y 31 following the Participant’ s Retirem ent, Early Retirement or Disability , and continue on
each successive January 31 until the Participant’ s benefits are distributed in full. For purposes of the preceding sentence, it is
expressly provided that, if a Participant’ s Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability occurs on a January 31, the first installment will
be paid on the next-following January 31.

continue to be made) to the Participant’ s beneficiary designated under Section 5.5 in accordance with Participant’ s separate election
for death benefits under Section 5.6, or, with respect to those Participants in pay status who die on or after October 1, 2003, if the
Participant did not designate a beneficiary under Section 5.5 or if no such beneficiary survives the Participant, payment shall be
made in the form of a lump sum to the Participant’ s estate.
5.4    Death Benefits.
    (a)    General.
    In the event of a Participant’ s Termination of Employment due to the Partic ipant’ s death, the Participant’ s Plan benefits will be
distributed in a lump  sum or, subject to the minimum account value restriction s of Section 5.6 below , in substantially equal annual
installments over a period not to excee d fifteen (15) years, in accordance with the Participant’ s distribution election given effect
under the provisions of Section 5.6 below . Amounts will be distributed to the beneficiary designated under 5.5 below .
    (b)    Lump Sum Distributions.
    If distribution is to be made in the form of a lump sum, the Participant’ s Plan benefits will be distributed within sixty (60) days
after the end of the calendar month in which the Participant’ s death occurs. If the Participant’ s death occurs on the last business day

Participant’ s Grandfathered Account, as determined under Section 3.5, as of the Annual Valuation Date coincident with or
immediately following the Participant’ s death; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per annum rate in effect

number of calendar days since such Annual Valuation Date; and (4) the Participant’ s Incentive Payment (if any) as provided in
Section 4.2(e).
    If the Participant’ s death occurs on a date other than the last business day (excluding for this purpose Saturday and Sunday) of a
Plan Year, the lump sum amount will equal the sum of: (1) the value of the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account as of the Annual
Valuation Date immediately preceding the Participant’ s death; (2) a pro rata amount of interest equivalent (determined at the per
annum rate in effect for a Plan Year on the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account value as of the immediately preceding Annual

the Participant’ s Incentive Payments (if any) as provided in Section 4.2(e) or Section 4.2(f).
45
    (c)    Installment Distributions.
    If distri bution is to be made in the form of annual installments, the installme nts will be based upon the value of the Participant’ s
Grandfathered Account as of the Januar y 31 coincident with or immediately following the Participant’ s death. For this purpose, a
Participant’ s Grandfathered Account value as of such January 31 shall be determined in accordance with the manner specified in
Section 5.3(c). The Plan benefits determined  abov e will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would  fully
amortize a loan equal to such Plan benefits over the period covered by the installment period (such period commencing on the
February 1 following the January 31 on which the Participant’ s Grandfathered  Account is valued under this Section), with interest
calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Particip ant’s death occurs. The first installment will be paid
as of the January 31 coincident with or following the Participant’ s death; and continue on each successive January 31 until the
Participant’ s benefits are distributed in full. For purposes of the preceding sentence, it is expressly provided that if a Participant dies
on a January 31, the first installment will be paid on the next-following January 31.
5.5    Designation of Beneficiary .
    A Participant may, by written or electronic instrument delivered to the Committee in the form prescribed by the Committee,
designate primary and contingent beneficiaries to receive any benefit payments which may be payable under this Plan following the
Participant’ s death, and may designate  the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payments. Any such
designation will apply to both the Participant’ s Account (as defined in the Plan) and his or her Grandfathered Account, if any; a
Participant may not designate different beneficiaries for his or her Account and Grandfathered Account. A Participant may change
such desig nations from time to time and the last written designation filed with the Committee prior to the Participant’ s death will
control. In the even t no beneficiary is designated, or if the designated benefi ciary predeceases the Participant, payment shall be
payable to the Participant’ s estate. For this purpose, a Participant’ s most recent written beneficiary designation properly filed under a
Prior Agreement shall continue to be given ef fect until otherwise modified in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
5.6    Form of Distribution.
    If a Participant’ s Termination of Employment is due to the Participant’ s Retirement, Early Retirement Disability or death, or
occurs after the Participant has attained  age fifty (50), distribution may be made, at the Participant’ s election, in a lump sum or in
substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years; provided, however , with respect to
Terminations of Employment occurring on or after October 1, 2003, an installme nt election will be given effect only if, as of the date
on which any lump sum payment would be valued, the participant’ s Grandfathe red Account is valued at greater than fifty-thousand
dollars ($50,000). Any Participant whose Grandfathered Account is valued at less than fifty-thousand dollars as of the date on which
any lump sum paym ent would be value d shall be defaulted to a lump sum payment. A Participant may file a distribution election
with the Committee on forms prescribed by the Committee. A distribution election, once given effect under this Section 5.6, will
apply to the Particip ant’s total Plan benefits. A Participant may, however , file a separate election for death benefits payable under
Section 5.2 - 5.4. To be given ef fect under this Section-
46
5.6, any distribution election for benefits payable under Section 5.2 or Section  5.3 to the Participant must have been filed with the
Committee at least six (6) full calend ar months before the occurrence of an event entitling the Participant to a distribution
thereunder . If a Participant’ s distribution election has not been on file with the Committee for the full six (6)-month period, it will
not be recognized or given effect by the Plan. In that event, distribution will be made in accordance with the Participant’ s most
recent distribution election which was filed with the Committee at least six (6) months prior to the Participant’ s Retirement, Early
Retirement, Disabili ty, or Termination of Employment after age fifty (50). The six (6)- month period provided above shall not apply
to death benefits payable under Section 5.2 - 5.4. For purposes of this Section 5.6, a Participant’ s last distribution election filed with
Walmart under a Prior Agreement will be given effect for the Participant’ s total Plan benefits until superseded or amended by the
Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Section, except that death benefits under Section 5.4 will be paid in a lump sum
unless an affirmative election to the contrary is filed by the Participant. If the Participant has not been a Participant in the Plan for at
least six (6) months prior to the Particip ant’s Retirement, Early Retirement Disability , or Termination of Employment after age fifty
(50), the Participant’ s initial distributio n election filed with Walmart will be given effect. For purposes of this Section 5.6, it is
expressly provided that any installment election which would be given effect hereunder for benefits payable under Section 5.3 shall
automatically be given effect for Partici pants who incur a Termination of Employment on or after June 1, 1999 and after attaining
age fifty (50), without the consent or ratification of any such Participant.
5.7    Reductions Arising fr om a Participant’ s Gross Misconduct.
    A Partic ipant’ s Plan benefits are conti ngent upon the Participant not engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with Walmart
or any Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in
Walmart’ s Statemen t of Ethics. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , in the event the Committee determines that the
Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Incentive Payments,
and credited Plan earnings thereon; and (b) earnings credited to the Participant’ s Grandfathered Account derived from Deferred
Compensation and Deferred Bonuses shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amount which would otherwise have
been credited if the applicable per annum rate (or if a portion of the Particip ant’s Grandfathered Account is being credited with
earnings, gains and losses, the positive earnings rate (if any) for such Plan Year) were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in
effect (or positive earnings rate, as appli cable) for such Plan Year. For the avoidance of doubt, if a portion of a Participant’ s Account
is being credited with earnings, gains and losses and such portion experiences a net loss for a Plan Year, such net loss shall not be
adjusted as a result of the Participant’ s engaging in Gross Misconduct under this Section 5.7. Under no circumstances will a
Participant forfeit any portion of the Participant’ s Deferred Compensation or Deferred Bonuses as a result of the Participant’ s
engaging in Gross Misconduct under this Section 5.7. Any payments receiv ed hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant’ s
beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with
Walmart or any Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as
provided in Walmart’ s Statement of Business Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts hereunder , that the
Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period,
47
the Participant (or the Participant’ s bene ficiary) shall repay to Walmart, or the applicable Related Affiliate, any amount in excess of
that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.7.
5.8    Distributions for  Unfor eseeable Emergencies.
    In the event of an Unforeseeable Emer gency , the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion and upon written application of
such Parti cipant, may direct immediate distribution of all or a portion of the Participant’ s Plan benefits. The Committee will permit
distribution because of an Unforeseeable Emer gency only to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the emer gency need.
    Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary , the provisions of this paragraph apply in the event a Participant receives a
distribution under this Section 5.8, the Participant’ s Termination of Employment for any reason occurs on a date other than the last
business day of a Fiscal Year (excluding for this purpose Saturday or Sunday), and the Participant’ s benefits hereunder for any
reason are paid in the same Fiscal Year in which the Participant received a distribution for Unforeseeable Emer gencies under this
Section 5.8. In that event, the Participa nt’s lump sum amount calculated under Sections 5.2, 5.3, or 5.4 will be reduced by the
amount distributed under this Section 5.8 and the applicable interest equivalent will be calculated in a manner consistent with
Section 4.1.
