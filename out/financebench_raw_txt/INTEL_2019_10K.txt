A YEAR IN REVIEW
 Our transformation to a data-centric company continued in 2019, and we experienced strong demand
and reached critical product milestones. W e achieved record revenue of $72.0 billion, 48% of which
was from our data-centric businesses. W e invested $13.4 billion in R&D while reducing our spending
to 27% of revenue. Additionally , we made capital investments of $16.2 billion, generated $33.1 billion
cash from operations and $16.9 billion of free cash flow , and returned $5.6 billion in dividends to
stockholders. W e continue to focus on improving supply and supporting our customers' growth. W e
increased our wafer capacity during 2019; however , we did not see a commensurate increase in client
CPU unit volume as wafer capacity was largely consumed by increases in modem and chipset
volumes, and unit die sizes.
Our 10nm manufacturing process entered full production as we launched our first products from this
advanced technology . We are accelerating the pace of process node introductions and moving back to
a 2- to 2.5-year cadence. W e are on track to deliver our first 7nm-based product, a discrete GPU, at
the end of 2021. 5G continues to be a strategic priority , and our exit from the 5G smartphone modem
business is enabling us to increase the focus of our 5G ef forts on the opportunity to modernize
network and edge infrastructure.
 
 
 "We achieved record revenue for
the fourth consecutive year ,
exercised discipline to drive
spending ef ficiencies, and
returned capital to our
stockholders. Our results reflect a
relentless commitment to improve
execution that benefits our
customers and increases
shareholder value."

OUR STRA TEGY
Data has become a driving force in society . Our customers are asking for solutions to turn data into actionable insights, amazing experiences, and operational ef ficiencies. Intel
platforms provide the foundation for these solutions because we have developed a portfolio of data-centric technologies that span the data center to the edge, enabling us to play
a differentiated and growing role in the success of our customers.
MAKE THE WORLD'S BEST SEMICONDUCTORS
Moore’ s Law , a law of economics predicted by Intel’ s co-founder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago,  continues to be a strategic priority and dif ferentiator . We make
significant investments and innovations in our silicon manufacturing technologies and platforms. Our proprietary technologies make it possible to integrate products and platforms
that address evolving customer needs and expand the markets we serve. However , making the best semiconductors requires more than just the best manufacturing process
technologies.
Product leadership is defined by our ability to
optimize across six engineering pillars: process
technology and packaging, architecture, memory ,
interconnect, security , and software. With these six
pillars, we are accelerating product innovation with a
focus on xPU platforms uniquely able to serve
diverse new workload opportunities (e.g., CPU,
GPU, AI accelerator and FPGA). These innovation
efforts will extend Intel’ s opportunities to deliver
products beyond the CPU that will contribute to the
success of our customers.
 
We manufacture a majority of our products in our own facilities and make significant investments in silicon manufacturing technologies and platforms as an IDM. W e are focused
on strengthening our IDM position by collaborating with the broader silicon manufacturing and design ecosystem to improve our design ef ficiency , including increased strategic
use of third-party design IP and foundries for certain components to allow us to focus on dif ferentiating technology . We are also pursuing design simplification to accelerate
innovation, including a significant reduction of design rules for future process nodes, to allow us to deliver the best solutions for our customer .
LEAD TECHNOLOGY INFLECTIONS
Our strategic intent is to lead in key technology inflections that are fundamentally changing computing and communications. The most important drivers of change we see today
are AI, the transformation of networks spearheaded by the transition to 5G, and the rise of the intelligent edge. W e see a future where Intel® technologies enable our customers
to move faster , store more, and process everything—from large complex applications in the cloud, to autonomous cars and small low-power devices on the edge.
AI helps our customers make sense of big data to unleash its potential. W e offer a combination of hardware and software technologies that deliver broad capabilities to support
computing, storage, transmission, and tuning in AI. W e have taken a multi-architecture approach to AI hardware. Intel® Xeon® processors provide a foundation for analytics and
AI, and software like the OpenVINO™ toolkit significantly simplifies the deployment of solutions. Intel® FPGAs allow customers to gain access to leading AI inferencing
performance for their models. Similarly , the Intel® Nervana™ Neural Network Processors and Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ VPUs are purpose-built for AI and support diverse
approaches for innovation in a wide range of applications, from healthcare to autonomous driving to facial recognition. Habana's Gaudi* AI training Processor and Goya* AI

 ■ Capital Investment■ Free Cash Flow1
OUR FINANCIAL CAPIT AL ALLOCA TION DECISIONS ARE DRIVEN BY THREE PRIORITIES
INVEST IN THE BUSINESS  ACQUIRE AND INTEGRATE  RETURN CASH TO
STOCKHOLDERS
Our first allocation priority is to invest in R&D
and capital spending to strengthen our
competitive position. W e shifted our R&D focus
as we began a transformation to a data-centric
company , while ef ficiently maintaining our
investment at approximately 20% of revenue.
We invested record levels of capital in logic
(primarily platform wafer manufacturing) during
the last two years to expand our capacity . With
that investment, we increased our 14nm wafer
capacity while also ramping 10nm production.
We expect to further increase our PC client
supply on both process nodes in 2020.
  Our second allocation priority is to invest in
companies around the world that will
complement our strategic objectives and
stimulate growth of data-centric
opportunities. W e look for acquisitions that
leverage and strengthen our capital and
R&D investments. In 2019, we completed
various acquisitions, including Habana Labs
and Barefoot Networks, to expand our
product of ferings and the markets we serve.
We take action when investments do not
meet our criteria, and in 2019 we divested
the majority of our 5G smartphone modem
business  for this reason. Our third allocation priority is to return
cash to stockholders. W e achieve this
through our dividend and share
repurchase programs. During 2019, we
paid $5.6 billion in dividends and
repurchased $13.6 billion in shares, up
from 2018. In October 2019, we
announced that we expect to
repurchase $20.0 billion in shares over
the next 15 to 18 months. Our approach
has reduced diluted shares outstanding
over time.

INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
R&D is a critical factor in achieving our strategic objectives to make the world's best semiconductors, to lead technology inflections, and to provide leading end-to-end platform
solutions. Successful R&D ef forts can lead to new products and technologies or improvements to existing ones, which we seek to protect through our IP rights. W e may augment
our R&D initiatives through the following methods: acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology .
PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY
Every year we make significant investments in R&D and we have intensified our focus on six
engineering pillars to advance our product capabilities. Our objective is to improve user
experiences and value through advances in performance, power , cost, connectivity , security , form
factor , and other features with each new generation of products. W e are also focused on reducing
our design complexity to improve our ef ficiency , including a significant reduction of design rules for
future process nodes.
 
Process.  Development of next-generation manufacturing processes remains a critical and
fundamental pillar . We announced that we are planning multiple waves of 10nm process,
progressively increasing transistor performance. W e also announced advances in our next-
generation 2.5D (EMIB) and 3D (Foveros) packaging technology which will enable us to mix and
match chips made on dif ferent processes into a single SiP , enabling new design flexibility and new
device form factors. The Intel 10nm product era is underway , as we began shipping our new 10th
generation Intel® CoreTM processors, previously referred to as Ice Lake. 
 Six Pillars of Product Leadership
Architecture.  We are designing products for four major computing architectures—CPU, GPU, AI accelerator , and FPGA products—as we move toward a model of providing
multiple "xPU" compute platforms for a more diverse era of computing. W e shipped the 10th generation Intel® CoreTM processors with our next-generation CPU
microarchitecture, which has architectural extensions designed for special-purpose computing tasks such as AI and cryptography , among other features. These processors also
include the next generation of graphics microarchitecture, with performance and feature upgrades. W e also continue to make progress on the development of our first discrete
GPU.
Memory . With our Intel® 3D NAND technology and Intel® Optane™ technology , we are developing products to disrupt the memory and storage hierarchy . The 4th generation of
Intel®-based SSDs are scheduled to launch in 2020 with 144-layer QLC memory technology . These SSDs are also Intel’ s first NAND memory technology created independently
by Intel since the conclusion of our partnership with Micron T echnology , Inc. (Micron). The 2nd generation Intel® OptaneTM SSDs for data centers are scheduled to start shipping
samples in 2020, and are designed to deliver three times the throughput while reducing application latency by four times. In addition, the second-generation Intel® OptaneTM DC
persistent memory is expected to achieve PRQ in 2020, and is designed for use with our future Intel® Xeon® CPUs.
Interconnect.  We have a broad portfolio of interconnect solutions, ranging from silicon to the data center to wireless. Our silicon photonics technology integrates lasers into silicon
to create high-speed optical connections that can help remove networking bottlenecks in the data center . We announced two initiatives to help influence the industry —USB4 and
CXL. USB4 advances the speed and capability for interconnect in client platforms. CXL, an open interconnect technology , creates a high-speed, low latency interconnect
between the CPU and accelerators, such as GPUs, FPGAs, and networking.
Security . We continue to make significant investments in security technologies. W e created the Intel Security Architecture and T echnologies Group to serve as a center for
security architecture across our products to design world-class product security architecture for the years ahead.
Software.  The performance potential of our hardware products is unlocked with software. Our vision is to unify our software abstractions across all our xPU platforms. W e are
developing a project called oneAPI to simplify programming for developers across our CPU, GPU, FPGA, AI accelerator , and other accelerator products, providing a unified
portfolio of developer tools for mapping software to the hardware that can best accelerate the code.
IP RIGHTS
We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes
patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask work, and other rights. W e actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other
assets. For a detailed discussion of our IP rights, see "Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing" within Other Key Information.

MANUFACTURING CAPITAL
We are an IDM. Unlike many other semiconductor companies, we primarily design and manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities, and we see our in-house
manufacturing as an important advantage. W e continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology as we seek to realize the benefits from Moore’ s Law .
Realizing Moore’ s Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size, or increase functionality and performance of a chip while
maintaining the same cost with higher density . This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power ef ficiency , cost, and size to
meet customers' needs. Our ability to optimize and apply our manufacturing expertise to deliver more advanced, dif ferentiated products is foundational to our current and future
success.
 We improved our 10nm factory production, yield, and
volume during 2019, and launched  10th-generation
Intel® CoreTM processors,  our first 10nm volume
product, and Intel® AgilexTM, our first 10nm FPGA. W e
expect to deliver initial production shipments of our first
10nm-based Intel® Xeon® Scalable product, Ice Lake,
in the latter part of 2020.
 
 
 
 
   
"Our technology and innovation pipeline is as full and as strong as it’ s ever
been. By embracing our ecosystems and delivering new capability on a
predictable cadence, we will continue to drive Moore’ s Law forward and
create compelling products for our customers.”
  
—Mike Mayberry , Senior V ice President, Chief T echnology Of ficer and General
Manager of T echnology Development  
We are on track to deliver our first 7nm-based product, a data center-focused discrete GPU, at the end of 2021 . We are approaching next-generation process nodes with a focus
on striking an optimal balance between schedule, performance, power , and cost and will continue to drive intra-node advancement.
NETWORK AND SUPPL Y CHAIN
We previously announced multiple manufacturing site expansions with multi-year construction activities that began in 2019. In addition to expanding our own manufacturing
capability , we are increasing our use of foundries to enable our dif ferentiated manufacturing to produce more CPU products. W e use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers
for certain components and leverage subcontractors to augment capacity to perform assembly and test in addition to our in-house manufacturing, primarily for chipsets and
adjacent products. As we considered the estimated $300 billion T AM1 opportunity ahead of us, it was imperative that we prepare our global manufacturing network to be
responsive to changes in demand. However , despite increasing 14nm wafer capacity , we did not see a commensurate increase in client CPU unit volume as wafer capacity was
largely consumed by increases in modem and chipset volumes, and unit die sizes. Our focus on capacity expansion and meeting customer expectations is critical as we move
into 2020.
We have nine manufacturing sites—six are
wafer fabrication and three are assembly/test
facilities. The map marks our manufacturing
sites and the countries where we have a
significant R&D or sales and marketing
presence.
The majority of our logic wafer manufacturing
is conducted in the U.S. W e incur factory start-
up costs as we ramp facilities for new process
technologies. W e ramped the 10nm process
node in Oregon and Israel in 2019, and began
production in Arizona in our 2020 fiscal year .
We also expanded our memory facilities in
Dalian, China.
 
 
 
Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing of our platform and memory products. These facilities are built following a “copy exactly”
methodology , whereby new process technologies are transferred identically from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility . This enables fast ramp of the operation
as well as better quality control. These wafer fabs operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity , allowing
us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs.
In 2019, we ramped 96-layer 3D NAND technology and prepared to begin manufacturing our 144-layer 3D NAND technology in 2020 in our facility in Dalian, China. The next
generation of Intel® Optane™ technology and SSDs are being developed in New Mexico following  the sale of our non-controlling interest in IMFT to Micron on October 31, 2019.
We will continue to purchase product manufactured by Micron at the IMFT facility under established supply agreements.

HUMAN CAPITAL
Evolving our culture is critical to delivering on our growth strategy and for continuing to attract and retain top talent needed to support our transformation to a data-centric
company . We have an amazing legacy of innovation and a powerful culture, yet our ambitions have grown. T ogether , we are evolving our culture to build an even brighter future.
Our global workforce of 1 10,800 is highly educated, with approximately 90% of our people working in technical roles. W e invest in creating a diverse, inclusive, and safe work
environment where our employees can deliver their workplace best every day .
All employees are responsible for upholding the Intel V alues,
Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel Global Human Rights
Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and
practices. For over a decade, we have tracked and publicly
reported on key human capital metrics, including workforce
demographics, diversity and inclusion data, turnover , and
training data.
"Tapping into the richness of our diverse workforce is key to driving
future growth. Intel will continue to be transparent about our progress
and our challenges, so we can partner with our customers and
ecosystem to find better solutions together ."
 
—Sandra Rivera , Executive V ice President and Chief People Of ficer
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
To shape the future of technology , we must be representative of that future. A diverse and inclusive workforce is
a business imperative and key to our long-term success. We committed $300 million to advance diversity and
inclusion in our workforce and in the technology industry . We achieved our goal of full representation in our U.S.
workforce two years ahead of schedule, meaning our workforce now reflects the percentage of women and
underrepresented minorities available in the skilled labor market in the U.S. This achievement was the result of a
comprehensive strategy that considered hiring, retention, and progression. Though we are proud of what we
have accomplished to advance diversity in our workforce, we still have work to do, including beyond the walls of
Intel. W e took action by joining 1 1 other companies to fund an initiative to double the number of women of color
graduating with computing degrees in the U.S. by 2025. W e also continue to look for and implement partnerships
and programs to increase retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations within our
workplace. The breakout of employees by gender provides our current global gender diversity .
COMPENSA TION AND BENEFITS
We strive to provide pay , benefits, and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees.
Our generous total rewards package includes market-competitive pay , broad-based stock grants and
bonuses, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time of f and
family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site
services. In 2019, we announced that we achieved gender pay equity globally by closing the gap in
average pay between employees of dif ferent genders in the same or similar roles after accounting for
legitimate business factors that can explain dif ferences, such as performance, time at grade level, and
tenure. W e also continued to advance transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly
releasing our 2017 and 2018 EEO-1 survey pay data mandated by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. The results reflected representation gaps and point to work that lies ahead.
However , due to our diversity and inclusion ef forts, there is promising growth of our junior female and
underrepresented talent from which our future leadership will be drawn. Our challenge now is to create
an environment that better helps our female and underrepresented employees develop and progress in
their careers, while also ensuring we are expanding our hiring and retention of diverse talent at more
senior , higher-paying positions.

programs, including on-site health centers.
 
 
SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL
We are committed to developing trusted relationships, giving back to our communities, and engaging in corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives. Collaboration with
stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, led to our reputation as a leading corporate citizen and creates
value in the form of consistent stakeholder support.
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IMP ACT
The health of our company and local economies depends on continued investments in innovation. W e provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the world. Many of these are
manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our own domestic and international factories. W e also impact economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities,
consumer spending by our employees, and tax revenue. W e make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in public-private partnerships to spur economic growth and
innovation.
We are at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments around the world to solve major societal
challenges. Simultaneously , we are empowering people through education and advancing social impact initiatives to create new career pathways into the technology industry ,
helping us build trust with key external stakeholders and support the interests of our employees. Our employees actively share their expertise and skills through volunteer
initiatives, and contributed 1 million hours of service in the communities where we operate in 2019.
We are committed to maintaining and improving processes to avoid human rights violations related to our operations, supply chain, and products.  While we do not always know
nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end-users may develop, we do not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights.
Where we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we will restrict or cease business with
the third party until and unless we have high confidence that Intel’ s products are not being used to violate human rights.
SUPPL Y CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY
We have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations to drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout the
supply chain. Actively managing our supply chain creates business value for Intel and our customers by helping to reduce risk, improve product quality , achieve environmental
and social goals, and raise the overall performance of our suppliers. Over the past five years, we completed more than 600 supplier audits using the Responsible Business
Alliance Code of Conduct standard. W e actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as advancing responsible minerals sourcing,
improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain, and addressing risks of forced and bonded labor . Our commitment to building a
diverse and inclusive workforce extends to the expectations we set for our suppliers—a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation and value for our business. W e continue
working toward our 2020 goal of reaching $1.0 billion in annual spending with diverse-owned suppliers. W e also announced the "Intel Rule" to help improve diversity in the legal
profession: Beginning in 2021, we will not retain or use outside law firms in the U.S. that are average or below average on diversity for their equity partners. W e are applying a
similar rule to firms used by our tax department, including non-legal firms.

NATURAL CAPITAL
Driving to the lowest environmental footprint possible helps us achieve ef ficiency , lower costs, and respond to the needs of our stakeholders. W e invest in conservation projects
and set company-wide environmental targets, seeking to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, water use, and waste generation. W e focus on building
energy ef ficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions and energy costs. W e also collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to identify
opportunities to apply technology to environmental challenges such as climate change and water conservation.
 "At Intel, we have long believed that to truly be a leader in manufacturing, we must also advance environmental sustainability and
corporate responsibility . For more than two decades, our sustainability practices have enabled us to create significant value for our
customers, investors, employees, and community stakeholders."
 
—Ann Kelleher , Senior V ice President and General Manager of Manufacturing and Operations
CLIMA TE AND ENERGY
We focus on reducing our own direct climate “footprint” and over the past two decades have reduced our direct emissions and electricity-generated emissions. Since 2012, we
have invested more than $200 million in energy conservation projects in our global operations, resulting in cumulative savings of more than 4.5 billion kWh and cost savings of
more than $500 million.  In addition to conserving energy , we invest in green power and on-site alternative energy projects that provide power directly to our buildings and design
all new buildings to LEED* standards. In 2019, we opened a LEED Platinum building in Israel with sensors that monitor lighting, temperature, ventilation, parking, and other
building services and systems that enable and foster smart innovation. It also employs stormwater runof f collection and injection wells to avoid groundwater runof f. We also focus
on increasing our “handprint”—the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence in
machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter , safer , and more ef ficient.
We are leveraging a leading framework developed by TCFD to communicate our approach to climate governance, strategy , risk management, and metrics and targets. In terms
of governance and strategy , we follow an integrated approach to addressing climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives,
and policies, including manufacturing and operations, government and public af fairs, supply chain, and product teams. Strategies and progress toward goals are reviewed with
senior executives and the Board’ s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. W e describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and we
describe our climate-related risks and opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy , and "Risk Factors" within this Form 10-K.
Regarding metrics and goals, for two decades we have set aggressive GHG reduction goals, including our 2020 goal to reduce our direct GHG emissions by 10% on a per-unit
basis from 2010 levels, which we are on track to achieve. Additional detail on our proactive ef forts to address climate change is included in our Corporate Responsibility Report,
as well as our CDP Climate Change Survey , both available on our website1.
WATER STEW ARDSHIP
Water is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. W e use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and we use industrial and reclaimed water
to run our manufacturing facility systems. Over the last two decades, our sustainable water management ef forts and partnerships have enabled us to conserve billions of gallons
of water , and over the last decade we have returned approximately 80% of our water back to our communities. W e continue to work toward our goal to restore 100% of our global
water use by 2025, with more than 20 projects funded in collaboration with environmental and community partners through the end of 2019. W e expect to restore approximately
1.5 billion gallons of water each year to local watersheds once these projects are complete.
CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND W ASTE MANAGEMENT
We have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies  that enable the recovery and productive re-use of waste streams. W e achieved
our 2020 goal of recycling 90% of our non-hazardous waste ahead of schedule. W e continue to work toward our 2020 goal of sending zero hazardous waste to landfills. Our aim
is to continue to invest in reducing the amount of waste we generate while increasing the amount recycled and identifying re-use solutions that reduce costs and  environmental
impact.

MARKET AND BUSINESS OVER VIEW
Market trends and strategy
Data is a significant force in society , and is being generated at an unprecedented pace. Data center customers want to work with partners who can deliver platforms to address
their most important technology challenges. Additionally , as more data is generated, organizations are seeking to analyze data closer to point of origin, giving rise to a data-
centric edge environment across industries and providers. W e expect the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand to move, store, and process data and extract
value from data. W e are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data-centric compute landscape, and we have invested both organically and through
acquisitions to capitalize on these demands. W e expect these trends to continue to fuel demand in DCG and other data-centric businesses in the long term.
DCG focuses on three market segments: cloud service providers, enterprise and government, and communications service providers. In 2019, cloud revenue grew as service
providers continued to invest in infrastructure to meet the explosive demand for digital services, AI, and data analytics. Cloud service provider revenue was down in the first half
as customers absorbed capacity and worked through inventory after a historic 2018 platform refresh; this trend stabilized in the second half of 2019. In our enterprise and
government market segment, legacy architecture continues to decline on-premise, but enterprises are rapidly embracing cloud as an architecture, and we expect to continue to
see growth in hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. In the communications service provider market segment, we gained market segment share as customers chose to virtualize
and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel® architecture.
Products and competitiveness
We offer customers an unmatched, broad portfolio of platforms and technologies designed to provide workload-optimized performance across compute, storage, and network.
These of ferings span the full spectrum from the data center core to the network edge. In addition, DCG focuses on lowering the total cost of ownership and on other specific
workload optimizations for the enterprise, cloud service provider , and communications service provider market segments, with hardware-enhanced performance optimizations for
AI workloads. DCG's platform value can be extended through Intel adjacent products such as FPGAs and SSDs. As a leading provider of data center platforms, we face
competition from competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), providers of GPU products such as NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA), companies using ARM*
architecture, new entrants developing products customized for specific data center workloads, and from internally developed solutions by cloud service providers and others. W e

MARKET AND BUSINESS OVER VIEW
Market trends and strategy
The Internet of Things market sits at the center of a global digital transformation. Through a robust network of devices, software, and sensors, the Internet of Things is
transforming the way businesses create products, deliver services, and conduct operations—from schools and hospitals, to retailers and smart factories. Internet of Things-based
solutions represent one of the fastest growing segments within the semiconductor industry . However , the Internet of Things is a highly fragmented market with a diverse
collection of competitors, products, and vertical segments.
 
 Many retailers are sitting on mountains of data that can be used to proactively address evolving customer demands. IOTG
provides solutions that enable retailers to extract the right insights from their data, in the right place, at the right time, allowing
them to use intelligence to transform their businesses to achieve their full potential. The result is greater ef ficiency , reduced
complexity , increased sales, and a more personalized customer experience. 
 
 
 
 As a result of consumer preference for more customization and higher-quality manufactured goods, a new kind of factory is
emerging—one that is cloud connected and data driven. It is an “intelligent factory” marked by hyper-agility , autonomous
production, and the use of data as a transformative force for the business. 
 
 
 
 
  
We help cities and infrastructure providers turn data into actionable insights to enable smarter , safer , and more ef ficient
solutions. Infrastructure providers and cities are seeking the best ways to use Internet of Things technology to enhance the
quality of services, improve public safety , reduce congestion, and achieve new levels of ef ficiency .
  
 
 
 
 
 By 2022, we expect approximately 82% of data traf fic will be video1. Processing high-quality video requires the ability to rapidly
analyze vast streams of data near the source and to respond to that data in real time, moving only relevant insights to the
cloud. Rather than a one-size-fits-all solution, Intel of fers a powerful portfolio of scalable hardware and software solutions,
including the OpenVINO™ toolkit and the new Intel® Vision Accelerator Design products, to move into an intelligent, data-
powered future and to meet the various performance, power , and price requirements of any business, in any industry .
 
  
 
 
 
Products and competitiveness
We have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products. This marketplace continues to expand significantly , with increasing types
and numbers of smart and connected devices for retail, industrial, and consumer uses, including smart video. As this market segment evolves, we face numerous large and small

MOBILEYE
OVERVIEW
Mobileye is the global leader in driving assistance and automation solutions. Our product portfolio
employs a broad set of technologies, covering computer vision and machine learning-based
sensing, data analysis, localization, mapping, and driving policy technology for ADAS and
autonomous driving. Mobileye’ s ADAS products form the building blocks for higher levels of
autonomy . Our customers and strategic partners include major global OEMs and T ier 1 automotive
system integrators.
 
HIGHLIGHTS AND SEGMENT IMPERATIVES
●We achieved record revenue and operating income in 2019 primarily due to the increased
adoption of ADAS. Our EyeQ* SoC volume grew approximately 43% and we expect to see
additional growth in the adoption of enhanced ADAS technologies.“Mobileye is fueling Intel’ s entry
into the Mobility-as-a-Service
business and is fully committed to
building on its leadership and
know-how in the ADAS market in
order to bring truly safe and
scalable autonomous mobility to
the market.”
 
—Prof. Amnon Shashua, President
and Chief Executive Officer , Mobileye●We had more than 30 new design wins, 47 active production programs1 across 25 OEMs,
and 16 program launches, including an industry-first 100-degree front-facing camera.
●Production vehicles equipped with our EyeQ*4 SoC and REMTM technology are deployed
across the globe and by the end of 2019 were collecting up to approximately 6 million
kilometers of data each day . This data is automatically aggregated with high update
frequency into "Roadbook™, a high-definition map, which is an essential component for
Robotaxi (autonomous taxis), consumer A V, and the fast-growing L2+ segment. The
insights gained from this data enhance existing driver-assistance propositions and provide
customers with superior driving experiences, performance, and additional safety .
 
MARKET AND BUSINESS OVER VIEW
Market trends and strategy
The adoption of ADAS is expanding as consumers increasingly consider ADAS a dif ferentiating factor in their automotive purchasing decisions . The continued growth of ADAS is
dependent on various factors, including regulation, market demand, and consumers' recognition of its value. Mobileye's ADAS solutions also serve as a qualification space for
our autonomous technology , using vast experience and proliferation to validate and constantly improve A V technology . AV technologies, in turn, make their way into premium
ADAS solutions, broadening monetization opportunities and value proposition. The A V-ADAS interplay allows Mobileye to sustain its technology leadership.
Car manufacturers are looking to enhance current L2+ solutions by improving system fidelity , availability , and performance. High-definition maps with constant updates, global
coverage, and various semantic features are a prerequisite for L2+ applications and the future deployment of Robotaxi and passenger car autonomy (Consumer A V). Canonical
mapping methods rely on extensive manual labor and dedicated mapping vehicles. Mobileye's disruptive REM crowdsource mapping technology provides automatic map
creation and updates. REM mapping capabilities are also being leveraged to extend the value of static and dynamic data to businesses in new market segments such as smart
cities and infrastructure surveys.
We believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial Robotaxi and
series-production passenger car Consumer A V. We expect Consumer A V to materialize only
after the Robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a mass market product
offering of Consumer A V are the cost of A V technology , ability to scale at a low cost, regulation
structure, and public acceptance. Thus, we see the Robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to
Consumer A V. Mobileye is well positioned to play a significant role in the broader MaaS market
with the commercialization of Robotaxi and the future Consumer A V market. Our full-stack self-
driving system—geared with our camera-centric backbone and vast experience in productizing
cutting-edge technology in the automotive industry—is the foundation for developing an
economically competitive A V solution. Proliferation of data-collection vehicles alongside REM
technology will allow for low-cost geographic expansion and coverage. Thus, Mobileye is
entering the MaaS market segment as an end-to-end service provider at scale.

Products and competitiveness
At its core, Mobileye's of fering for ADAS and A V is propelled by our computer vision and AI expertise and software assets, deployed on our EyeQ* SoC family . The tight co-
design of hardware and software gives the EyeQ* SoC the ability to support complex and computationally intense tasks and sets it apart from competition because it is purpose-
fit for high-compute, low-power , automotive-compliant mission profiles. Mobileye’ s 5th generation EyeQ*5 SoC is designed to act as the central computer for fully autonomous
driving vehicles. Mobileye has been able to achieve power , performance, and cost targets by employing proprietary computational cores that are optimized for a wide variety of
computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning tasks, including deep neural networks. Starting with EyeQ*5, Mobileye is supporting an automotive-grade standard
operating system and providing a complete software development kit to allow customers to dif ferentiate their solutions by deploying their algorithms on EyeQ*5. The EyeQ*5 SoC
will be in final sampling stages in 2020 and is expected to be in commercial vehicles starting in 2021. The EyeQ*5 SoC is already operational in Mobileye’ s autonomous test
vehicles.
EyeQ*5 serves as the computational foundation for Mobileye’ s scalable camera-only surround sensing system. The system consists of multiple independent computer vision
engines and deep networks for algorithmic redundancy . The result is a robust and comprehensive model of the environment that allows end-to-end autonomous driving. The
surround computer vision system is the backbone of Mobileye’ s autonomous vehicle architecture and the flagship of fering for next-generation ADAS.
The next significant building block in Mobileye’ s complete of fering is REM mapping technology , which compiles crowdsourced mapping data from EyeQ* SoC-equipped vehicles.
Our REM Roadbook™ of fering can enhance current ADAS applications through a variety of advanced features, including predictive adaptive cruise control, lane-level localization
in all weather and road conditions, hands-free driving application, and real-time alerts, such as for construction activity and road hazards.
The third building block in Mobileye’ s full stack of fering is our unique formal model for A V safety (RSS). At its core, RSS is a pragmatic method to design and then to ef ficiently
validate the safety of an A V, serving as the governing safety layer for the decision-making system. RSS formalizes human decision making for safe driving under two main
principles: First, it acknowledges the need to balance safety with useful driving by making plausible worst-case scenario assumptions for other road users; and second, it
provides a technology-neutral model and a transparent framework for the regulatory endeavor of building an industry standard for safety .

MARKET AND BUSINESS OVER VIEW
Market trends and strategy
Overall market conditions continue to improve, but we are operating in an increasingly competitive market. With continued investment in product and process technology , and in
partnership with our customers, we are delivering platform innovation across several key vectors. W e were supply constrained particularly at the value-end of the market as
higher than expected PC demand outpaced our supply . We made capacity investments to improve our supply throughout the year , increasing our second-half PC CPU supply by
double digits compared with the first half of this year . Supply remains tight in our PC business, where we are operating with limited inventory buf fers.
Products and competitiveness
We are accelerating the pace of innovation and delivering an annual cadence of leadership products , including for modern notebooks and high-end enthusiast PCs. We deliver
value to our customers by leveraging our engineering capabilities and working with our partners to deliver technology across every major vector of the computing experience,
including performance, battery life, connectivity , memory , graphics, and form factors to create the most advanced PC platforms .
We introduced our 10th Gen Intel® Core™ processor , previously referred to as Ice Lake, a highly integrated new CPU core architecture with new Gen1 1 graphics, first integrated
Wi-Fi6 (1 1AX) and Thunderbolt™ 3 connectivity , and Intel® Deep Learning Boost. Built on Intel’ s advanced 10nm process technology , these processors deliver increased
graphics performance, AI, and new levels of integrated connectivity for thin-and-light laptops and 2-in-1s. Further , they give our OEM partners the freedom to innovate on design
and aesthetic by reducing the silicon footprint while still delivering the latest standards and world-class performance.
We also expanded our 9th Gen family with 14 new Intel® Core™ vPro® processors for high-performance mobile and desktop PCs, bringing the Intel® Core™ i9 processor to the
best-for-business platform for the first time. W e launched Intel® Xeon® E workstation processors with up to eight cores, 16 threads, 5-GHz turbo frequency , Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+), Intel®
Optane™ memory; and delivered a special edition i9-9900KS desktop SKU, with 5-GHz all-core turbo and Intel® Performance Maximizer .
In May 2019, we launched our multi-year innovation program, Project Athena, with more than 20 verified devices on shelves in time for the holiday season. These devices meet
the criteria of our Project Athena 1.0 specification, and are tested and verified in Intel labs to ensure they deliver new experience targets or key experience indicators defined by
real-world usage models and innovation across six areas: instant action, performance and responsiveness, intelligence, battery life, connectivity , and form factor .
Our platform products continue to be enhanced by new adjacent technologies. W e launched the Wi-Fi6 1 1X connectivity solution, the first Wi-Fi6 solution in the PC market,
featuring faster speeds, increased throughput, and better experiences. W e are driving new industry standards for USB-C connector-based products with Thunderbolt™ 3. In
addition, we are delivering a new level of performance and high-capacity storage with Intel® Optane™ memory H10 with Solid State Storage to enable enhanced SSD
experiences.
Our advanced pace of innovation is more important than ever as we are operating in an increasingly competitive market. W e face strong competition from AMD, as well as
vendors who use applications processors based on ARM* architecture, such as Qualcomm Inc. (Qualcomm), and customers who internally develop their own semiconductors .
We are expecting an increasingly competitive environment in 2020.

REVENUE
Compared to a year ago, data-centric revenue was up 3%, driven by a strong mix of high-performance product sales in the second half of 2019, partially of fset by T AM
contraction in the DCG enterprise and government market segment and continued pressure on NAND pricing. Our PC-centric business was flat, driven by a strong mix of higher
performance products as the commercial segment of the PC market remained strong, and modem continued to grow , offset by lower year over year platform volume.
Our total revenue grew from $55.4 billion in 2015  to $72.0  billion in 2019 , representing 7% CAGR. Data-centric businesses collectively grew faster than Intel as a whole at 11%
CAGR over the last five years, and are approaching 50% of our revenue.

2019 – 2018
In 2019 , revenue was $72.0 billion , up $1.1 billion , or 2%, from 2018 . Our data-centric businesses collectively grew 3% year over year and made up nearly half of our total
revenue in 2019 . Platform ASPs increased due to stronger core mix of fset by a decline in NSG ASPs due to lower NAND market pricing and a decrease in DCG platform unit
sales as the enterprise and government market segment contracted. Our PC-centric business was flat year over year as ASP strength from richer commercial segment mix and
modem growth were of fset by declines in platform volume.
2018 – 2017
In 2018 , revenue was $70.8 billion , up $8.1 billion , or 13%, from 2017 . The increase in revenue was primarily driven by strong performance across our data-centric businesses,
which collectively grew 18% year over year and made up nearly half of our total revenue in 2018 . Our Mobileye business had revenue of $698 million . Our PC-centric business
grew 9%, above our expectations, due to PC T AM1 growth and demand for our leadership products. The increase in 2018 revenue was partially of fset by the loss of revenue from
businesses that were divested, specifically $534 million  from the divestiture of the ISecG and approximately $165 million from the divestiture of Wind River .

GROSS MARGIN
We derived most  of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platform products in the DCG and CCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2019
decreased  by $1.6 billion , or 4%, compared to 2018 , and in 2018  increased  by $4.6 billion , or 12%, compared to 2017 . In 2019, our adjacent products revenue continued to grow
primarily due to memory and modem products, which have a lower gross margin percentage than our overall average. Lower platform unit sales and margin compression on
memory products resulted in lower gross margins, which were partially of fset by platform ASP strength.

  MD&A  41
Table of Contents
 
 
OPERA TING ACTIVITIES
Cash provided by  operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
For 2019  compared to 2018 , the $3.7 billion  increase  in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were
driven by taxes, other assets and liabilities, and accounts receivable, of fset by customer utilization of prepaid supply agreement payments and inventory build.
For 2018  compared to 2017 , the $7.3 billion  increase  in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income, of fset by changes in working capital.
Changes in working capital were driven by taxes and accounts receivables, of fset by relatively flat inventory levels. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2018 compared
to 2017 were flat as the benefit of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate was of fset by the payment related to the 2017 U.S. T ax Reform transition tax. W e received $ 1.4 billion  of
customer deposits and prepaid supply agreements in 2018, net of customer utilization, compared to $ 1.1 billion  in 2017.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for
acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $16.2 billion  in 2019  ($15.2 billion  in 2018  and $11.8 billion  in 2017 ).
The increase  in cash used for investing activities in 2019  compared to 2018  was primarily due to net trading asset activity , acquisitions, and capital expenditures. The increase
was partially of fset by net available-for-sale debt investment activity .
The decrease  in cash used for investing activities in 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily due to lower cash paid on acquisitions and increased cash from net trading asset
activity . This was partially of fset by increased capital expenditures, net available-for-sale debt investments activity , decreased proceeds from divestitures, and decreased sales of
equity investments (substantially all from ASML sales).
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and
proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
The decrease  in cash used for financing activities in 2019  compared to 2018  was primarily due to increased long-term debt issuance, of fset by increased repurchases of common
stock. During 2019 , we repurchased $13.6 billion  of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $10.7 billion  in 2018 . In October 2019,
the Board of Directors approved a $20.0 billion  increase in our authorized stock repurchase program authorization, and we announced that we expect to repurchase $20.0 billion
in stock over the next 15 to 18 months. As of December 28, 2019 , $23.8 billion  remained available for repurchasing common stock under the repurchase authorization limit. In
general, we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate in the future. Our total dividend payments were
$5.6 billion  in 2019  compared to $5.5 billion  in 2018 . We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 109 quarters. In Q1 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $0.33 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2020 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2020.
The increase  in cash used for financing activities in 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily due to decreased long-term debt issuance and increased repurchases of common
stock.

1 Operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases, but exclude non-lease components.
2 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets as of December 28, 2019, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property.
3 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services.
4 Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. For further information, see
"Note 9: Income Taxes" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
5 Amounts represent principal payments for all debt obligations and interest payments for fixed-rate debt obligations. Interest payments on floating-rate debt obligations, as well as the impact of
fixed-rate to floating-rate debt swaps, are excluded. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
6 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities.
Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table, because they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid.
7 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-
term liabilities.
The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. T iming of payments and actual amounts paid may be
different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in "Other purchase obligations and commitments" in the preceding table include agreements that are
enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the
approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the
agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.
For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or
based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding
nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current
manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than
binding agreements.
Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. Approximately half  of our milestone-based
contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty .
As of December 28, 2019 , assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately $498 million .
For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay
in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is
contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards
vest.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are af fected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may
not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 28,
2019  and December 29, 2018 . Actual results may dif fer materially .

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RA TES
We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with
foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally of fset by
corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. W e are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and
may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.
Substantially all  of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However , a significant  portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies,
primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan . We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange
rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. W e may also hedge currency risk arising from
funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. W e may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs.
We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency
exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and of fsetting recorded monetary asset
and liability positions outstanding as of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $38 million  and less
than $46 million , respectively .
INTEREST RA TES
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and
the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. W e generally enter into interest rate contracts to
convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. W e also enter into
swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally of fset by
corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.
A hypothetical increase in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0% , after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our
investment portfolio of approximately $88 million  as of December 28, 2019  (a hypothetical decrease of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase of approximately $110 million  as
of December 29, 2018 ).
Taking into account floating-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of up to 1.0%  would result in an increase in
annual interest expense on our indebtedness of approximately $139 million  from debt outstanding as of December 28, 2019  (an increase of approximately $215 million  from debt
outstanding as of December 29, 2018 ).
EQUITY PRICES
Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. W e typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through
hedging activities at the inception of our investments. In the event we do decide to enter into hedge arrangements, before doing so we evaluate legal, market, and economic
factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with
or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives.
We also utilize total return swaps to of fset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes
in fair value of these total return swaps are generally of fset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.
As of December 28, 2019 , the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $450 million  ($1.4 billion  as
of December 29, 2018 ). A substantial majority  of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of December 29, 2018  was concentrated in our investment in ASML of $1.1
billion . During 2019, we fully sold our investment in ASML. T o determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have
analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of 40% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of
hedges and of fsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $180 million , based on the value as of December 28,
2019  (a decrease in value of approximately $576 million , based on the value as of December 29, 2018  using an assumed decline of 40%). Beginning in 2018, as explained in
"Note 2: Accounting Policies " within the Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities will be measured and recorded at fair
value with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement.

Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices af fect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the
impacts directly . Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively af fect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood
of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public of ferings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great
deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently , we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-
marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $3.5 billion  as of December 28, 2019  ($3.0 billion  as of December 29, 2018 ) and included our investment in Unisoc of $658
million  ($658 million  for Unisoc as of December 29, 2018 ). The carrying amount of our equity method investments was $37 million  as of December 28, 2019  ($1.6 billion  as of
December 29, 2018 ). Substantially all of our equity method investments balance as of December 29, 2018  was concentrated in our investment in IMFT . During 2019, we sold our
non-controlling interest in IMFT to Micron.
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly af fected by commodity price risk to a material degree. W e have established forecasted transaction
risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. W e may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging
programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities.
 
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP , this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below . We believe these non-
GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between
periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating
our business and measuring our performance.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax ef fects where applicable. Income tax ef fects
have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for , or superior to, financial
measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP , and the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully
evaluated.
ACQUISITION-RELA TED ADJUSTMENTS
Acquisition-related adjustments exclude charges related to amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments, and other acquisition-related
charges.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology , brands, and customer relationships acquired in
connection with business combinations. Cost of sales and operating expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements include amortization charges for intangible assets acquired
primarily for the acquisitions of Mobileye in 2017 and Altera in 2016. These charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our
acquisitions.
Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company’ s cost of
manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The acquisition-related i nventory valuation adjustments exclude the expected profit margin component from cost of
sales that was recorded under business combination accounting principles associated with our acquisition of Mobileye.
Other acquisition-related charges primarily include bankers' fees, compensation-related costs, and valuation charges for stock-based compensation incurred in connection with
the acquisition of Mobileye.
Our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance, and
provide investors with additional means to reflect costs of sales, gross margin and spending trends.
RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include
asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with the exit of the 5G smartphone modem business and the ISecG divestiture. W e exclude restructuring and other
charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. These costs do not reflect our current
operating performance. Consequently , our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our
past operating performance.
GAINS OR LOSSES FROM DIVESTITURE
We divested our 5G smartphone modem business in 2019, Wind River in 2018, and ISecG in 2017. W e exclude gains or losses and related tax impacts resulting from
divestitures when calculating certain non-GAAP measures. These adjustments facilitate a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past
operating performance.
 
  MD&A  45
Table of Contents
 
 
ONGOING MARK-T O-MARKET ON MARKET ABLE EQUITY SECURITIES
When calculating certain non-GAAP measures, we exclude gains and losses resulting from ongoing mark-to-market adjustments of our marketable equity securities after the
initial mark-to-market adjustment is recorded upon a security becoming marketable, as we do not believe this volatility correlates to our core operational performance.
Consequently , our non-GAAP earnings per share figures exclude these impacts to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and comparisons to our past operating
performance.
TAX REFORM ADJUSTMENT
We recognized a higher income tax expense in Q4 2017 as a result of T ax Reform and made adjustments to the original estimate during 2018. W e exclude the provisional tax
estimate and adjustments when calculating certain non-GAAP measures. These adjustments facilitate a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons
to past operating results.
FREE CASH FLOW
We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow , which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity , capital resources, and quality of earnings.
This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful to investors in understanding our capital requirements and provides an additional means to reflect the cash flow trends of our
business.
Following are the reconciliations of our most comparable U. S. GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:

SALES AND MARKETING
CUST OMERS
We sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers.
In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and cloud service providers, who
buy our products through distributor , reseller , retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for
greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see " Note 4: Operating Segments " within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel® processors and other products from our distributors. W e
have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to systems integrators. Our microprocessors and other products
are also available in direct retail outlets.
SALES ARRANGEMENTS
Our products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard
terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright
indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product
development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory
availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. W e also of fer discounts,
rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology .
In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined
by the agreed-upon shipping terms . Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, 30 days after shipment or delivery . We assess
credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit
support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.  Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy , fraud, or other
failure of the customer to pay .
Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold
merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the dif ference between the original price paid and the current price that we of fer. Our products
typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted
generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor .
DISTRIBUTION
Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly
with us or through distributors. W e have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.
SEASONAL TRENDS
Historically , our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year , accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth
quarter .
MARKETING
Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, dif ferentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers,
and to of fer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The
Intel® Core™ processor family and the Intel® Quark™, Intel Atom®, Celeron®, Pentium®, Intel® Xeon®, and Itanium® trademarks make up our CPU brands.
We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing
activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press
relations. W e market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased
performance, improved energy ef ficiency , and other capabilities such as connectivity and communications.

Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands
beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor
technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel® brands, subject
to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. W e have
also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.
COMPETITION
We discuss competitive conditions in our businesses, the market segments in which we compete, our competitors, and the principal methods of competition in the "Segment
Trends and Results" section of MD&A, particularly under the heading "Market and Business Overview" for each business, as well as in "Risk Factors," particularly in the risk
factors "W e face significant competition" and "Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed."
Our key competitive advantages include those discussed in "Our Strategy" and "Our Capital" within Fundamentals of our Business, and the "Our Products" section of MD&A,
particularly the discussions of our broad product portfolio and in-house manufacturing capabilities. Our competitive challenges include those discussed in Risk Factors,
particularly in the risk factors "W e face significant competition"; "Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed";
and "W e are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology ."
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LICENSING
Intel owns and develops significant IP and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes
patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and mask work rights. W e actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP
and other assets. Such ef forts can be dif ficult, however , particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP
standards. For a discussion of the risks related to IP and our IP rights, please see “W e are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings” in
"Risk Factors" within Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent,
copyright, or other IP right.  
We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting
processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are
granted. As we expand our product of ferings into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development ef forts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents
based on our own R&D ef forts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that
purchase and enforce patents and other IP , may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own
products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.
The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. T o distinguish our
products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to
promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. W e also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets,
keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
 "Intel carefully protects its innovations, and we have a long history of vigilantly enforcing our IP rights against infringement.
Strong IP protections make it possible for Intel to continue to invest the enormous resources required to innovate and
advance our strategic goals to make the world’ s best semiconductors, lead technology inflections, and be the leading end-
to-end platform provider for the new data world."

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. W e
consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate
assumptions, or selection of a dif ferent estimate methodology , could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated
Financial Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.
Refer to " Note 2: Accounting Policies " within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows:
•Inventories —the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory , excluding factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value
considering future demand and market conditions;
•Long-lived assets —the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property , plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and goodwill, including
the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;
•Non-marketable equity investments —the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments; and
•Loss contingencies —the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
RISK FACTORS
The following risks could materially and adversely af fect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could
decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be af fected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to
be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and
historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in
MD&A and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes.
CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSEL Y AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESUL TS.
Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict.  Our products are used in dif ferent market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among the market
segments served by our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. It is dif ficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, in the first half of 2019, customers of our
DCG business worked through inventory and absorbed computing capacity purchased in 2018, leading to a year over year decline in DCG platform revenue in the first half,
followed by growth in DCG platform demand and revenue in the second half of 2019. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products,
can reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.
Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:
•business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in the global or regional economies;
•consumer confidence or income levels, and the levels of customer capital spending, which may be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in
government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;
•our ability to timely introduce competitive products;
•competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;
•the level of our customers’ inventories and computing capacity;
•customer order patterns, including order cancellations, which can be af fected by maturing product cycles for our products, customers’ products, and related products such as

Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs.
Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or dif ficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to
utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. T o the extent product demand decreases
or we fail to forecast demand accurately , we could be required to write of f inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. T o the extent the
demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which
would increase our expenses. W e may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely , to the extent
product demand increases  or we fail to forecast accurately and produce the mix of products demanded, we may be unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough to
meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships. For example, we have been
experiencing supply constraints and have been prioritizing production of our server and high-performance PC products, which during 2019 contributed to loss of share in the
value end of the PC market, where we were short of supply while demand remained healthy .
We face significant competition . The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments; changes in industry
standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond
to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has
intensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.
Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy ef ficiency , integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, price, quality , reliability , security , software
ecosystem and developer support,  time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability . The importance
of these factors varies by product—for example, performance is a key competitive factor for data center platform products , and failure to introduce new products with
performance advantages  can harm our competitive position and market segment share in our DCG business. For our memory products, price, density , and non-volatility are
among the most important competitive factors. We will not realize our strategic goal to become the leading end-to-end provider for the new data world if our products do not meet
our customers’ requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape.
We face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies of fering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs , including
those of fered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as  ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity  and
networking  products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms for specific
market segments or applications, such as the ARM* architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network ef fects for competitors when an
ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. W e also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs,
cloud service providers, and others, including customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets or customize
their designs for specific computing workloads.  Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as T aiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , Ltd. or Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. As an IDM, we have higher capital
expenditures and R&D spending than many of our “fabless” competitors. W e also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for
example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position.
Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products , exert downward
pricing pressure on our products, and adversely af fect our business . Additionally , a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry
have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively
affect our financial results.
To compete successfully , we must maintain a successful R&D ef fort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all
ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&D ef forts across six engineering pillars: process technology , architecture, memory , interconnect, security , and software. These
include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools, and we cannot guarantee that all of these ef forts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For
example, to the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve transistor density with suf ficient manufacturing yields and operational
efficiency , relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost and product performance disadvantages. Similarly , to the extent our R&D ef forts do not timely produce
semiconductor designs for our platform products with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and with new features such
as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed.
We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our ef forts to develop and market new products fail, and the products and technologies we invest in and
develop are not always well received by customers , who may adopt competing technologies. W e make significant investments in R&D, and our investments at times do not
contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.
If we are not able to compete ef fectively , our financial results will be adversely af fected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the
write-down of the value of certain assets.

Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed . In recent years, in connection with our strategic transformation
to a data-centric company , we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent products in programmable solutions, AI, and autonomous driving. W e also expanded our
adjacent product of ferings in client computing, the data center , the Internet of Things, and memory , with of ferings such as modems, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel®
Optane™  technology products , and we have made investments in discrete graphics and networking infrastructure products. These ef forts are not always successful. In April
2019, we announced that we would be exiting the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business, and
in November 2019, we completed the sale of the majority of our smartphone modem business.
These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our expanded T AM, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in certain of
these market segments, incumbent competitors with established technologies and customer bases , lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing
products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as significantly as projected, or at all, or sometimes utilize technologies that are dif ferent from
the ones that we develop and manufacture, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving
innovations in technology , but if they fail to deliver the benefits anticipated, or if our customers use competing technologies for these workloads, we may not realize a return on
our investments in these areas. Similarly , while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect
intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our ef forts. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in
these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, time-to-market, and energy ef ficiency of our products, as well as expand our
software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Some of these new businesses face challenging market conditions. For example, market
pricing for NAND memory products has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and NAND pricing pressure led to an operating loss for our NSG business in 2019. Despite
our ongoing ef forts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or
realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges .
Changes in the mix of products sold can impact our financial results . Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our
products and dif ferences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product of ferings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those
based on Intel Atom® processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel® Xeon® processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our
higher-priced platform products. T o the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products
represent an increasingly greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.
WE OPERA TE GLOBALL Y AND ARE SUBJECT T O SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.
Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results.  We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our
business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover , sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 78% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended
December 28, 2019 , with revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, contributing approximately 28% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial
results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely af fected by a number
of global and regional factors outside of our control.
Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary , or trade policy , higher interest
rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending,
periodically occur and can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including
regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing
costs or limits on our access to capital markets, reduced liquidity , adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties and other financial institutions, and declines in the
value of our financial instruments.
International trade disputes at times result in increased tarif fs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less
competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the
movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy , domestic sourcing initiatives, or other
formal and informal measures that could make it more dif ficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets.
Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to increased tarif fs and trade restrictions, including tarif fs applicable to some of our products, and have af fected
customer ordering patterns. The U.S. has imposed restrictions on the export of U.S.-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including
certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely af fect our financial results, result in reputational harm to
us due to our relationship with such companies, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is dif ficult to predict what further
trade-related actions governments may take, which may include additional or increased tarif fs and trade restrictions, and we may be unable to quickly and ef fectively react to
such actions. For example, U.S. legislation has expanded the power of the U.S. Department of Commerce to restrict the export of “emerging and foundational technologies” yet
to be identified, which could impact our current or future products.

Trade disputes and protectionist measures , or continued uncertainty about such matters,  could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or
recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained trade tensions could lead to long-term changes in global
trade and technology supply chains, which could adversely af fect our business and growth prospects.
We can be adversely af fected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur , including:
•geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability , human rights concerns, and terrorist activity , including, for example,
geopolitical tensions and conflict af fecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;
•natural disasters, public health issues, and other catastrophic events;
•inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data
hosting, or telecommunications providers;
•formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tarif fs, and changes in the ability to obtain export
licenses, which could be changed without notice;
•government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country , or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;
•adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives;
•differing employment practices and labor issues;
•ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;
•local business and cultural factors that dif fer from our current standards and practices;
•continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to
withdraw from the European Union;
•fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively af fected by liquidity , credit deterioration or losses, interest rate
changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors; and
•uncertainty regarding LIBOR—certain of our interest rate derivatives and investments are based on LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable
interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR: LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause
LIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform dif ferently than in the past, and while we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the
2021 target date, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in
our interest income.
We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that dif fer among jurisdictions, af fecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax;
import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment;
product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise
impact our business operations negatively . For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology
may limit global adoption, impede our strategy , and negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and
compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely af fect our customers and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things,
and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.
Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees , contractors,
suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. V iolations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanct ions against us, our of ficers, or our
employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny ,
which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.
We are af fected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales
occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those
markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as
overseas capital expenditures. W e also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be ef fective to of fset any , or more
than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Catastrophic events can have a material adverse ef fect on our operations and financial results.  Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be
disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT
systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a
result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including due to cybersecurity incidents af fecting our
suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result
in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity , such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of
water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. Catastrophic events could make it dif ficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver
products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely af fect our revenue and require significant recovery
time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can
be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. Furthermore, even
if our operations are unaf fected or recover quickly , if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, they may reduce or cancel their
orders, which may adversely af fect our results of operations.
We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property , casualty , and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability ,
cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be
unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Damage to our reputation can damage our business.  Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers, and other
stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this Risk Factors
section, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. Our reputation is also impacted by how we respond to corporate crises. Corporate crises can arise from
catastrophic events as well as from incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; product quality , security , or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal
control failures; corporate governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications;
marketing practices; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues or incidents that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity .
To the extent we fail to respond quickly and ef fectively to address such crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and
could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions.
Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely af fect our business and operating environment. It could reduce investor confidence in us,
adversely af fecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover , repairing our
reputation and brands may be dif ficult, time-consuming, and expensive.
WE ARE VULNERABLE T O PRODUCT AND MANUF ACTURING-RELA TED RISKS.
We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology . Production of integrated circuits is a complex process.
Realizing the economics of Moore’ s Law is a strategic priority , and we are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly
advanced nodes. W e are not always successful or ef ficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and production processes. For example, we experienced
significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology . Although we began shipping products based on our 10nm process technology in volume in 2019, our delays in
transitioning to this node occurred while third-party foundries developed new , competitive process technologies. Competitors using third-party foundries are able to benefit from
the improvements such process technologies made in performance, energy ef ficiency , and other features, which can help increase the competitiveness of their products.
Our ef forts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including dif ficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, and
investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the process node introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected
benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital investments,
particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive.
Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing
throughput times, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue
opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, including additional competitive
features in our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer
manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely af fect our gross margins, and can contribute to
manufacturing supply constraints. In addition, as the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing
processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which can also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.

From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors , defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruptions in our
supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions—all of
which could af fect the timing of production ramps and yields.
Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and af fect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In
addition, to the extent we face delays in the timing of our product introductions, we could become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be
adversely af fected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to of fset these costs over time.
We face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to
have several sources of supply . However , for certain materials and equipment, including certain photolithography tools, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or
upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, supplier consolidation or business failures can impact the nature, quality , availability , and pricing of the products and services
available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary production materials or equipment can disrupt our production processes and make it more dif ficult for us to
implement our business strategy . Production can be disrupted by the unavailability of resources, such as water , silicon, electricity , gases, and other materials. The unavailability
or reduced availability of materials or resources can require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our
manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier
could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.
We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test, and supply certain components or products. These have included components and products related to
networking, communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory , and may include these and other components and products in the future. T o the extent any of
these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-ef fective basis, in suf ficient volumes, or at all, we can encounter supply delays or disruptions or incur
additional costs that could adversely af fect our business and financial results. For example, while we have supply agreements providing for the supply of Intel® 3D XPoint ™
memory from IMFT for a period following the close of Micron’ s purchase of our interest in IMFT , we will need to fund and develop internal manufacturing options to continue 3D
XPoint memory supply in the longer term.
In addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that
negatively af fects our reputation. Moreover , given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do
not directly control the procurement or employment practices of such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.
We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications),
and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase
or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and
third-party products and software. W e also face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology , cause personal injury or property damage,
even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or
applications, including transportation and autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, and financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.
Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include :
•writing of f some or all of the value of inventory;
•recalling products that have been shipped;
•providing product replacements or modifications;
•reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur;
•defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and
•paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.
These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product
issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis or at all, do not always operate as intended or ef fectively resolve such issues for all
applications, and can result in adverse performance ef fects. Any product defects, errata, or other issues could damage our reputation, negatively af fect product demand, delay
product releases, or result in legal liability . Product defects or errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors. Any of these occurrences could harm our
business and financial results. In addition, although we maintain liability insurance, our coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our
insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.

We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations.  The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous
materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in:
•regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;
•suspension of production;
•alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes;
•damage to our reputation; and
•restrictions on our operations or sales.
Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our
ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements.
Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses.
Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements, and increased compliance and energy costs.
Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our
business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.
WE ARE SUBJECT T O CYBERSECURITY AND PRIV ACY RISKS.
We face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.  We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet, or to introduce malicious
software, to our IT systems. Additionally , individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and third-
party service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our
hardware products and our associated software and services . Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that
intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. W e are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to
gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers;
interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others ; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services . Such attempts are increasing in
number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the af fected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of
our business operations , including our manufacturing operations . Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can
experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.
From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. T o date, none have resulted in any material adverse
impact to our business or operations. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems,
writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to
regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third
parties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the dif ficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing
adequate preventative measures. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their
recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to
additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and
effects.
We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.  We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as
well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard
specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. As we have become a more data-centric company , our processors and other
products are being used in additional and new critical application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and
process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our
processors include a category known as side-channel exploits, such as the variants referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown.” Additional categories and variants have been
identified, such as the "MDS" and "T AA" side channel variants, and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted
in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. V ulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become
known. W e, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or ef fects of a vulnerability , including
the extent, if any , to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security
vulnerability , including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of
existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or
regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.

Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely
basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or ef fectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties,
including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability , effectiveness,
and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether and how to develop and deploy
mitigations. W e and such third parties may make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay or limit development or deployment of a
mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance ef fects, reboots, system instability or unavailability ,
loss of functionality , data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior , decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our
products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.
Security vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse ef fects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely af fect our results of operations, financial condition, customer
relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not they involve attempted or successful exploits, they may
result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation,
responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other
remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce
demand for our products and services. These ef fects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can
be more ef fectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover , third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are
available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely af fect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. For
example, information on the “Spectre” and “Meltdown” side-channel variants was prematurely reported publicly before mitigation techniques to address all vulnerabilities were
made widely available, and certain of the mitigation techniques did not operate as intended.
Theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory
proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and
security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex
regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could
expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our
inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings
against us by governmental entities or other third parties.
WE ARE SUBJECT T O IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIA TED WITH LITIGA TION AND REGULA TORY PROCEEDINGS.
We cannot always enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. W e rely on
IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP rights. Our ability to
enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to enforce or
protect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our
IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party . Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could
harm our business. From time to time, governments  adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments
require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and
business. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce
acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for
technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees .
Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally
license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to
some of our patents, and under current case law , some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in
industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to of fer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications.
Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a
result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.

Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business.  We face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies,
including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new , larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other companies. Some
of these claimants are funded by investment firms and have substantial resources, which can increase our defense costs. Additionally , large patent portfolio owners sometimes
divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company , increasing the number of parties who own IP rights previously all held by a single party . We are typically
engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs
to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the ef forts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition,
we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets or confidential information or end-user data that we obtain in
conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suf fer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and
reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand
for our products or disrupt our customers’ businesses, which could in turn adversely af fect our results of operations.
As a result of IP rights claims, we could:
•pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, or royalties;
•stop manufacturing, using, selling, of fering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;    
•need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or
•enter into settlement or license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of af fected items, our revenue
could be harmed.
We rely on access to third-party IP , which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  Many of our products include third-party technology or
implement industry standards, and may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained
on commercially reasonable terms. However , there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use
third-party technology , or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the
software’ s source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.
We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.  From time to time,  we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder , consumer ,
competition, commercial, IP , and other issues on a global basis. As described in "Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we
are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur , including monetary
damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory
licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the
outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly , time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.
WE MUST A TTRACT , RET AIN, AND MOTIV ATE KEY EMPLOYEES.
Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staf f, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for highly skilled employees
in our industry is intense. In addition, changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. Changes in the interpretation and
application of employment-related laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs.
To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Our employee hiring and
retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other
compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees would be weakened, which could harm
our results of operations. Furthermore, changes in our management team can disrupt our business, and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees could
adversely af fect our results of operations.

WE ARE SUBJECT T O RISKS ASSOCIA TED WITH OUR STRA TEGIC TRANSACTIONS.
Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our
results of operations.  Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial capital allocation strategy . We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements
for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:
•our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;
•failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize;
•disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’ s attention;
•failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner , if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all or without materially burdensome
conditions, IP disputes or other litigation, dif ficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;
•our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;
•our inability to ef fectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;
•our inability to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or our dif ficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and technology;
•controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to identify compliance
issues or liabilities;
•our failure to identify , or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; and
•the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.
Moreover , our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly , if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo
the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives.  Where an existing investment does not meet our criteria for
success, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options. W e may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include
unfavorable prices and terms; changes in market conditions; limitations due to regulatory or governmental approvals, contractual terms, or other conditions; and continued
financial obligations or unanticipated liabilities associated with such transactions . In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all .
Any of these risks could have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or
several concurrent acquisitions.
We invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments.  We make investments in public and private companies around the world to
further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their
strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at
the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all . Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company ,
if any , is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public of fering or acquisition. T o the extent our investments are in marketable equity
securities, as is typically the case for our public company investments, fluctuations in the fair value of those securities are recognized as gains or losses in our income statement,
and consequently , declines in the fair value of these investments can reduce our net income. T o the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can
include failures to achieve business objectives as well as bankruptcy , we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.
WE ARE SUBJECT T O SALES-RELA TED RISKS.
We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.  We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added
resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. W e depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand,
provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a
product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or
replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our
products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor . Using third
parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products
that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they face financial
difficulties, including bankruptcy , which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. V iolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by
distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may
reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.

From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized “gray market.” Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution
channel and certain geographies, which could adversely af fect our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is dif ficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more
challenging. Gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to
be substandard.
We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers.  Collectively , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of our net revenue
in 2019  and 39% of our net revenue in 2018 . We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.
Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increase d the significance of certain customers, particularly cloud service
providers, to some  of our data-centric businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further
consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration
and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; product performance; energy ef ficiency; feature dif ferentiation; product
quality , reliability , and factors af fecting server uptime; and product security and security features. T o the extent we do not execute ef fectively across these factors, our competitive
position and market segment share may be adversely af fected. Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own
semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely af fected, and may
continue to af fect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we dif ferentiate our products
through customization to meet customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.
If one of our key customers stops purchasing from us, materially reduces its demand for our products, or delays its orders for our products, we may experience a reduction in
revenue, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for g reater than 10%
of our net consolidated revenue, see "Note 4: Operating Segments" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We face risks related to transactions with government entities.  We receive proceeds from U.S. federal, state, local and foreign government entities associated with grants,
incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often af fected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including,
with respect to U.S. government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the
award, administration and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, U.S. government contracts are subject to special rules
on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security , and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions,
including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the U.S. government.
CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE T AX RA TE MA Y REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.
A number of factors can increase our ef fective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:    
•changes in the volume and mix of profits earned across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;
•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;
•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;
•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;
•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;
•changes in available tax credits;
•changes in our ability to secure new , or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;
•changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income
and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;
•changes in accounting standards; and
•our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.
WE HA VE FLUCTUA TIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY OF OUR ST OCK REPURCHASES.
We are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program, and the amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on our priorities for
the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders
as dividend payments. Changes in cash flows, tax laws and other laws, and the market price of our common stock can also limit or alter the amount and frequency of our stock
repurchases.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
TO THE ST OCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECT ORS OF INTEL CORPORA TION
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , the related
Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Stockholders' Equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019 , and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly , in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company at December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 28, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’ s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control —Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the T readway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 23, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our
audits. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or
complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below , providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

  Inventory Valuation
Description of the Matter
 The Company’ s net inventory totaled $8.7 billion as of December 28, 2019, representing 6.4% of total assets. As explained in "Note 2:
Accounting Policies" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and
applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting
date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have
achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the determination of normal capacity levels in its
manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is
valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality .
 Auditing management’ s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of lower of cost or net
realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is highly judgmental and considers a number of factors that are af fected by
market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally ,
for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.
   
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our Audit
 We evaluated and tested the design and operating ef fectiveness of the Company’ s internal controls over the costing of inventory , the
determination of whether inventory is of salable quality , the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related
estimated costs and selling prices, and the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory .
 Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product costs and selling prices, and product
demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management’ s inventory valuation assessment. W e compared the significant assumptions
used by management to current industry and economic trends. W e assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information,
including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed
sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the
assumptions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
TO THE ST OCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECT ORS OF INTEL CORPORA TION
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Intel Corporation’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control —Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company)
maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2019  Consolidated Financial
Statements of the Company and our report dated January 23, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’ s management is responsible for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company‘s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of ef fectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of
our revenue is derived from product sales. In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or
delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms. Prior to 2018, we deferred product revenue and related costs of sales on sales made to
distributors that allowed for price protections or right of return until the distributor sold through the merchandise. W e include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue,
and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales.
We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. V ariable consideration is estimated and reflected as
an adjustment to the transaction price. W e determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of
consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are of fset against their
receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities. The impacts of
distributor sales price reductions resulting from price protection agreements are also estimated based on historical analysis of such activity and are reflected as a reduction in net
revenue.
We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for certain of our products. W e generally record the payment as a
reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as expense when the marketing activities occur .
During the second half of 2017, we transitioned customers from previous of ferings under the Intel Inside® program to cooperative advertising of ferings more tailored to customers
and their marketing audiences. These cooperative advertising costs are recorded as a reduction of revenue beginning in the second half of 2017, as we no longer meet the
criteria for recording these as expense.
INVENT ORIES
We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering
milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of
sales can be capitalized as inventory .
For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty , it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This
milestone is known as PRQ. W e have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory . Prior to PRQ,
costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred. A single PRQ has previously ranged up to $870 million  for our high-volume
products.
The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and
assembly and test facilities. W e apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory
loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be
recognized as cost of sales in that period. W e refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges are insignificant in the years presented. Charges in
years prior to those presented have ranged up to $1.1 billion  taken in connection with the 2009 economic recession.

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances
reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling
price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies with costs improving over time due to
scale and improved yields. Additionally , inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment.
The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory , as well as inventory that is not of salable quality . We use the demand forecast to develop
our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when
developing these demand forecasts. W e compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any , of
obsolete or excess inventory . When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , we are
required to write of f inventory .
PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. W e also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures.
Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. W e record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to
property , plant and equipment.
We evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property , plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence
between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology , and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology . As we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives
of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than
we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets’ revised useful lives.
Assets are “grouped” and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. W e assess property , plant and equipment for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an
impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant
changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. W e measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of
the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows arising from the use of that asset grouping. If an asset grouping carrying value is not
recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. W e measure the impairment by comparing the dif ference between the
asset grouping carrying value and its fair value.
FAIR V ALUE
When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability . Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the
measurement alternative, equity method investments, cost method loans receivable, grants receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than
three months. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.
The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:
•Level 1.  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. W e evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.
•Level 2.  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations.
All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. W e use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curve, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as
significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific
restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from
internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.
•Level 3.  Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. W e monitor and review the inputs
and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3
inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.

DEBT INVESTMENTS
We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include
investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.
Marketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the
marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair
value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility , largely of fset by
losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other , net.
Marketable debt investments are considered available-for-sale investments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or
when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. A vailable-for-sale debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of
purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. A vailable-for-sale debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three
months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. A vailable-for-sale debt investments with remaining maturities beyond one year
are classified as other long-term investments. A vailable-for-sale debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss). W e determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level, and record the interest income
and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other , net.
Our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For these investments, we consider whether it is more likely than not that we will be required
to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or whether recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the investment is unlikely because a credit loss exists.
When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment, we separate other-than-temporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses,
which are recognized in interest and other , net, and amounts not related to credit losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).
EQUITY INVESTMENTS
We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:
•Marketable equity securities  are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or
unrealized, recorded through the income statement. Prior to 2018, these securities were classified as available-for-sale securities and measured and recorded at fair value
with unrealized changes in fair value recorded through other comprehensive income.
•Non-marketable equity securities  are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost
minus impairment, if any , plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Prior to fiscal 2018, these securities were accounted for using the cost
method of accounting, measured at cost less other-than-temporary impairment.
•Equity method investments  are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method
investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any , plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss
from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.
Prior to 2018, we recorded unrealized gains and losses through other comprehensive income (loss) and realized gains and losses on the sale, exchange, or impairment of these
equity investments through gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price
changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities by the same issuer . Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio
requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of
observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates.
Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews.
Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered
include the investee's financial condition and business outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology , operational and financing cash flow activities, and other
relevant events and factors af fecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity
investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and
comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.

•Non-marketable equity securities  are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long-lived assets. Upon determining that an
impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds
the fair value. Prior to 2018, non-marketable equity securities were tested for impairment using the other-than-temporary impairment model.
•Equity method investments  are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a
decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a suf ficient period of time to allow for recovery .
Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.
DERIV ATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk,
commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty . A master netting arrangement allows counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. W e
also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates
from contractually established thresholds. W e record the collateral within other current assets and other long-term assets with a corresponding liability . For presentation on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not of fset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments
are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.
Cash flow hedges  use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for the following items:
•variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending; and
•coupon and principal payments for our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated indebtedness.
The after-tax gains or losses from the ef fective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction af fects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of
the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge ef fectiveness assessment, and are recognized
in earnings in interest and other , net. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other , net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the
underlying item.
Fair value hedges  use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to
changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the of fsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other , net. These derivatives are classified in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities.
Non-designated hedges  use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-
U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivables recognized at fair value. W e also use interest rate
contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our U.S.-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt instruments classified as trading assets.
The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate,
primarily in interest and other , net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally of fset by the changes in the fair
value of the related derivatives.
LOANS RECEIV ABLE
We elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with a related derivative
instrument. When the fair value option is not elected, the loans are carried at amortized cost. W e measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method,
which is based on the ef fective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. W e classify our loans within other current and long-term assets.

CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans
receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net
settlement of transactions with the same counterparty .
We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy , we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of
that counterparty’ s relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy , substantially all  of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in
investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject
to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any , by which the counterparty’ s obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty . As
of December 28, 2019 , our total credit exposure to any single counterparty , excluding money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and U.S. agency securities and reverse
repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $800 million . To further reduce credit risk, we obtain and secure available collateral from
counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions, when we deem it appropriate.
A substantial majority  of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. W e also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and
communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. W e believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers
(39% as of December 28, 2019 ) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. For more
information about the customers that represent our accounts receivable balance, see " Note 4: Operating Segments ."
We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. W e believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our
major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will
seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.
BUSINESS COMBINA TIONS
We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition.
This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:
•intangible assets, including the valuation methodology , estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment
share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;
•deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date;
•inventory; property , plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; deferred revenue; and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable; and
•goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. W e
allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
GOODWILL
We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year , or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment
exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. The reporting unit’ s carrying value used in an impairment test
represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt.
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors af fecting the reporting unit. Additionally , as
part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a
reporting unit’ s fair value.
Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’ s fair value. Significant estimates include market
segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated costs, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital.
We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In the current year , the fair value for all of our
reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary .

IDENTIFIED INT ANGIBLE ASSETS
We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life. Acquisition-related in-process R&D assets represent the fair
value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially , these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to
amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to
amortization from this point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.
We perform a quarterly review of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. These reviews can be af fected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our
business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines.
EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS
We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise,
cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for
each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award.
INCOME T AXES
We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary dif ferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. W e measure
deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in ef fect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or
settled.
We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation
allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. W e believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is af fected by management’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments;
therefore, such changes could also af fect our future provision for taxes.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on
examination by the tax authority . The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. W e recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the Consolidated
Statements of Income.
We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. W e have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income
and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-U.S. earnings or for outside basis dif ferences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to
indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis dif ferences. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the
working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various
jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.
LOSS CONTINGENCIES
We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in
connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such
contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
 
NOTE 3 : RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
ACCOUNTING ST ANDARDS ADOPTED
Leases
Standard/Description: This new lease accounting standard requires that we recognize leased assets and corresponding liabilities on the balance sheet and provide enhanced
disclosure of lease activity .
Effective Date and Adoption Considerations:  Effective in the first quarter of 2019. The standard was adopted applying the modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the
period of adoption. Our leased assets and corresponding liabilities exclude non-lease components.

Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters: Within the opening balances for the fiscal year beginning December 30, 2018, we recognized leased assets and
corresponding liabilities in other long-term assets of $706 million , which includes $81 million  of previously recognized prepaid land use rights, as well as corresponding accrued
liabilities of $180 million  and other long-term liabilities of $445 million .
Accounting Policy Updates and Disclosures: We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and classify it as finance or operating. Leased assets and corresponding
liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that
we will exercise that option. W e have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and the non-lease components are accounted for separately and not included in
our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Leases primarily consist of real property , and, to a lesser extent, certain machinery and equipment.
We recognized leased assets in other long-term assets of $628 million  and corresponding accrued liabilities of $175 million , and other long-term liabilities of $375 million  as of
December 28, 2019 . Our leases have remaining terms of 1 to 9 years , some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 39 years . The weighted average
remaining lease term was 4.7 years , and the weighted average discount rate was 3.4% as of December 28, 2019 .
For the twelve months ended  December 28, 2019 , lease expense was $185 million . In accordance with the new leases standard, discounted and undiscounted lease payments
under non-cancelable leases as of December 28, 2019 , excluding non-lease components, were as follows:

NOTE 4 : OPERATING SEGMENTS
We manage our business through the following operating segments:
•DCG
•IOTG
•Mobileye
•NSG
•PSG
•CCG
•All other
We offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package. A platform
product may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services of fered by Intel. Platform products are used in various form factors across our DCG, IOTG, and CCG
operating segments. W e derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class of product.
DCG and CCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, Mobileye, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments;
however , we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our Internet of Things portfolio, presented as Internet of Things, is comprised of
the IOTG and Mobileye operating segments.
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.
The "all other" category includes revenue and expenses such as:
•results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented;
•historical results of operations from divested businesses;
•results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;
•amounts included within restructuring and other charges;
•a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and
•acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and
operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments.
Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating
segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products
are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment’ s operating
income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. W e do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or
taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments.
Except for these dif ferences, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

In 2019 , our three largest customers accounted for 41% of our net revenue ( 39% in 2018 , 40% in 2017 ), with Dell Inc. accounting for 17% (16% in 2018 , 16% in 2017 ), Lenovo
Group Limited accounting for 13% (12% in 2018 , 13% in 2017 ), and HP Inc. accounting for 11% (11% in 2018 , 11% in 2017 ). These three customers accounted for 39% of our
accounts receivable as of December 28, 2019  (45% as of December 29, 2018 ). Substantially all of the revenue from these customers was from the sale of platforms and other
components by the CCG and DCG operating segments.
Net revenue by country as presented below is based on the billing location of the customer . Revenue from unaf filiated customers for each period was as follows:

NOTE 5 : EARNINGS PER SHARE
We computed basic earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. W e computed
diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock
outstanding during the period.

Earnings per share—Basic  $ 4.77  $ 4.57  $ 2.04 
Earnings per share—Diluted  $ 4.71  $ 4.48  $ 1.99 
 
Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock
options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP . In December 2017, we paid cash to satisfy the
conversion of our convertible debentures due 2035, which we excluded from our diluted earnings per share computation starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and are no longer
dilutive. In November 2019, we issued a notice of redemption for the remaining $372 million  of 2009 Debentures with a redemption date of January 9, 2020. Our 2009
Debentures required settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion. Since the conversion premium was paid in cash or stock at our option, we
determined the potentially dilutive shares of common stock by applying the treasury stock method. W e included our 2009 Debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per
share of common stock in all periods presented because the average market price was above the conversion price.
Securities that would have been anti-dilutive are insignificant  and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all periods presented.

Contract liabilities are primarily related to prepayments received from customers on long-term prepaid supply agreements toward future NSG product delivery . The short-term
portion of contract liabilities is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other accrued liabilities.
The following table shows the changes in contract liability balances relating to long-term prepaid supply agreements during 2019:

Prepaid supply agreements balance as of December 28, 2019  $ 1,805  
 
As new long-term prepaid supply agreements are entered into and performance obligations are negotiated, this component of the contract liability balance will increase, and as
customers purchase product and utilize their prepaid balances, the balance will decrease.
We expect our remaining contract liability balance of $1.8 billion  to be recognized into revenue over the next 4 years. The timing and amount of future anticipated revenue may
vary from our expectations due to changes in supply , demand, and market pricing.

ISecG divestiture  —  —  3.3 
Other  0.7  (0.1) (1.1)
Effective tax rate  12.5 % 9.7 % 52.8 %
 
The majority  of the increase  in our ef fective tax rate in 2019  compared to 2018  was driven by one-time benefits that occurred in 2018.
The majority of the decrease in our ef fective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted from initial tax expense from T ax Reform and the tax impacts from the ISecG divestiture
that we had in 2017, but not in 2018. The reduction of the U.S. statutory rate, combined with the net impact of the enactment or repeal of specific tax law provisions through T ax
Reform, drove the remaining decrease in our ef fective tax rate in 2018.
We derive the ef fective tax rate benefit attributed to non-U.S. income taxed at dif ferent rates primarily from our operations in China, Hong Kong, Ireland, and Israel. The statutory
tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 25.0%. In addition, we are subject to reduced tax rates in China and Israel as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and
make certain capital investments. These conditional reduced tax rates expire at various dates through 2026  and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration.

As of December 28, 2019 , our federal, and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $427 million  and $357 million , respectively . Most  of the non-
U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S. and some U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates
through 2040 . A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in
any one year .
At December 28, 2019 , we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $22.0 billion  that we have indefinitely invested, and on which we have not
recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.

Current income taxes receivable of $76 million  as of December 28, 2019  ($162 million  as of December 29, 2018 ) are included in other current assets. Current income taxes
payable of $575 million  as of December 28, 2019  ($366.0  million  as of December 29, 2018 ) are included in other accrued liabilities.
Long-term income taxes payable of $4.9 billion  as of December 28, 2019  ($4.9 billion  as of December 29, 2018 ) includes uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated
federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits. Long-term income taxes payable may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet
been paid, including the substantial majority of the transition tax from T ax Reform, which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018.
UNCERT AIN T AX POSITIONS
Unrecognized tax benefits were $548 million  as of December 28, 2019  ($283 million  as of December 29, 2018  and $211 million  as of December 30, 2017 ). If the remaining
balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $454 million  as of December 28, 2019  ($178 million  as of December 29,
2018 ) and a reduction in the ef fective tax rate. The tax benefit for settlements, ef fective settlements, and remeasurements was insignificant  in all periods presented. Interest,
penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.
We comply with the laws, regulations, and filing requirements of all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. W e regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax
authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain
U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. W e
estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2019 could decrease by as much as $300 million  in the next 12 months.
We file federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns. Excluding pre-acquisition Altera tax years, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax examinations for years prior
to 2012. For U.S. state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2012 . We are subject to U.S. federal examination for pre-acquisition Altera tax
years back to 2004 . We have filed petitions before the U.S. T ax Court relating to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing
transaction for certain pre-acquisition Altera tax years. The U.S. T ax Court ruled in favor of Altera and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. During 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion on the Altera litigation in favor of the government. W e filed a petition for rehearing
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was declined in the fourth quarter of 2019. W e are currently assessing next steps.

IMFT
IMFT was formed in 2006 by Micron and Intel to jointly develop NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint™ technology products. IMFT was an unconsolidated variable interest entity
and all costs of IMFT were passed on to Micron and Intel through sale of products or services in proportional share of ownership. IMFT depended on Micron and Intel for any
additional cash needs to be provided in the form of cash calls or MDF . During the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $290 million  related to IMFT . As
of December 29, 2018 , we had a carrying value of $1.6 billion  in IMFT and owned a 49% interest in the entity . Our proportional share of IMFT costs was approximately $550
million  in 2019 (approximately $494 million  in 2018 and $415 million  in 2017).
In January 2019, Micron exercised its right to call our interest in IMFT and on October 31, 2019, Intel sold its non-controlling interest in IMFT to Micron. With the sale of our
interest in IMFT and MDF repayment throughout the year , we received $1.7 billion  in cash proceeds during 2019. With the sale of our interest, we reported a gain of $107 million
in the fourth quarter of 2019. W e will continue to purchase products manufactured by Micron at the IMFT facility under established supply agreements.
McAfee
During the second quarter of 2017, we closed our divestiture of the ISecG business and retained a  49% interest in McAfee as partial consideration. Our investment is accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. During 2019 , we received $632 million  in dividend distributions from McAfee. During 2017, we received $735 million  in dividend
distributions from McAfee. As of December 28, 2019, we had no accounting carrying value in McAfee. For further information related to the divestiture of the ISecG business, see
"Note 1 1: Acquisitions and Divestitures ."
Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. (Unisoc)
During 2015, we invested $966 million  for a minority stake of Beijing UniSpreadtrum T echnology Ltd., a holding company under T singhua Unigroup Ltd. During 2017, we reduced
our expectation of the company's future operating performance due to competitive pressures, which resulted in an impairment charge of $308 million . Beijing UniSpreadtrum
Technology Ltd. and RDA Microelectronics subsequently merged and rebranded themselves as Unisoc. W e account for our interest in Unisoc as a non-marketable equity
security . The second phase of the investment required additional funding of approximately $500 million . However , as of October 2019, this obligation has been terminated by
mutual agreement.
NOTE 11 : ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
 
ACQUISITIONS
We completed five acquisitions in both 2019 and 2018, all of which qualified as business combinations. Except for the acquisition of Habana Labs, these acquisitions are not
significant to our results of operations, individually or in the aggregate. The consideration for the acquisitions in 2019 and 2018 primarily consisted of cash and was allocated to
goodwill and identified intangible assets . For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments, see " Note 12: Goodwill ," and for information on the
classification of intangible assets, see " Note 13: Identified Intangible Assets ."
Habana Labs
On December 12, 2019, we acquired Habana Labs, an Israel-based developer of programmable deep learning accelerators targeting AI workloads in the data center . Habana
Labs strengthens our AI portfolio and accelerates our ef forts to capitalize on the nascent, fast-growing AI silicon market opportunity . Total consideration to acquire Habana Labs
was $1.7 billion . The fair values of the assets acquired relate to goodwill of $1.5 billion  and acquisition-related intangible assets of $250 million , which was primarily in-process
research and development. The goodwill and operating results of Habana Labs are included in our DCG operating segment.
Goodwill of $1.5 billion  arising from the acquisition is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits that will be generated from the combination of Intel and Habana
Labs. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

1 To manage foreign currency risk associated with the Australian-dollar-denominated notes issued in 2015, we entered into currency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of
$577 million, which effectively converted these notes to U.S.-dollar-denominated notes. For further discussion on our currency interest rate swaps, see "Note 17: Derivative Financial
Instruments." Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Australian-dollar-denominated notes in the table above were calculated using foreign currency exchange rates as of
December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.

The fair value of our convertible debentures is determined using discounted cash flow models with observable market inputs, and takes into consideration variables such as
interest rate changes, comparable instruments, subordination discount, and credit-rating changes. As of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , the fair value of short- and
long-term debt (excluding commercial paper and drafts payable) was $30.6 billion  and $27.1 billion , respectively . These liabilities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value
hierarchy , based on the nature of the fair value inputs.
Senior Notes
During 2019 , we issued a total of $2.8 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Net proceeds from the of fering are being used for general corporate purposes, which
may include refinancing outstanding debt and repurchasing shares of our common stock.
In 2019, we redeemed our $915 million , 4.70% senior notes due December 2045 .
Our floating-rate senior notes pay interest quarterly and our fixed-rate senior notes pay interest semiannually . We may redeem the fixed-rate notes prior to their maturity at our
option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future
senior unsecured indebtedness and will ef fectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
Oregon and Arizona Bonds
In 2019 , we received proceeds of $648 million  in aggregate from the sale of the 2019 Arizona Bonds and the 2019 Oregon Bonds. The bonds are our unsecured general
obligations in accordance with loan agreements we entered into with the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler , Arizona and the State of Oregon Business
Development Commission. The bonds mature in 2049 and carry an interest rate of 5.00%. The 2019 Arizona Bonds and the 2019 Oregon Bonds are subject to mandatory tender
in June 2024 and March 2022, respectively , at which time we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until another
fixed-rate period is selected or until their final maturity date.
In 2018, we remarketed $423 million  principal of the 2018 Arizona Bonds and the 2018 Oregon Bonds. The bonds are our unsecured general obligations in accordance with loan
agreements we entered into with the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler , Arizona and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. The bonds
mature between 2035 and 2040 and carry interest rates of 2.40% - 2.70%. Each series of the 2018 Arizona Bonds and the 2018 Oregon Bonds is subject to mandatory tender in
August 2023, at which time we can remarket the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period, or as variable-rate bonds until another fixed-rate period is selected or
their final maturity date.
Convertible Debentures
In 2009, we issued the 2009 Debentures, which pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually . In 2019 , we paid $1.5 billion  in cash to satisfy conversion obligations for $615 million  in
principal, resulting in a cumulative loss of $156 million  in interest and other , net, and $1.0 billion  as a reduction to stockholders' equity related to the conversion feature.
The 2009 Debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions. Holders can surrender the 2009 Debentures for conversion if the closing price of Intel common stock has
been at least 130% of the conversion price then in ef fect for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding
fiscal quarter . We settle conversion of the 2009 Debentures in cash up to the face value, and any amount in excess of face value is settled in cash or stock at our option. As of
August 5, 2019, we can redeem, for cash, all or part of the 2009 Debentures for the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of Intel common
stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in ef fect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period. In November 2019, we issued a
notice of redemption for the remaining $372 million  of 2009 Debentures with a redemption date of January 9, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2019 , the closing stock price
conversion right condition of the 2009 Debentures continued to be met and therefore the debentures are convertible at the option of the holders until January 6, 2020, prior to our
redemption. Our 2009 Debentures required settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion.
As a result, the $217 million  carrying amount of the 2009 Debentures was classified as short-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2019  ($569
million  as of December 29, 2018 ). The excess of the amount required to be settled in cash if converted over the carrying amount of the 2009 Debentures of $155 million  has
been classified as temporary equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2019  ($419 million  as of December 29, 2018 ).
The 2009 Debentures are subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior debt and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries. W e have concluded that the 2009
Debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion options qualify as derivatives. In addition, we have concluded that the
embedded conversion options would be classified in stockholders' equity if they were freestanding derivative instruments and are not accounted for separately as derivative
liabilities.

ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED A T FAIR V ALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS
Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property , plant and equipment, are recorded at
fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. If an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized on our non-
marketable equity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.
We classified non-marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity method investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on these investments held as of
December 28, 2019  were $113 million  ($416 million  held as of December 29, 2018  and $537 million  held as of December 30, 2017 ).
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED A T FAIR V ALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or
impaired in the current period, grants receivable, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and our short-term and long-term debt.
As of December 28, 2019 , the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable, loans receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements was $543 million  (the aggregate carrying
amount as of December 29, 2018  was $833 million ). The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value and is categorized as Level 2 within
the fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the fair value inputs.

NOTE 18 : RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
 
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans are
designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide an unfunded
non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees.
We expensed $379 million  for discretionary contributions to the U.S. qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans in 2019  ($372 million  in 2018
and $346 million  in 2017 ).
U.S. RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN
Upon retirement, we provide benefits to eligible U.S. employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a
portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.
As of December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018 , the projected benefit obligation was $633 million  and $547 million , respectively , which used the discount rate of 3.3% and
4.4%, respectively . The December 28, 2019  and December 29, 2018  corresponding fair value of plan assets was $553 million  and $476 million , respectively .
The investment strategy for U.S. Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested
solely in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external investment manager . The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix
of equities in developed countries. As of December 28, 2019 , substantially all  of the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and
were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs.
The estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:
(In Millions)  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025-2029
Postretirement Medical Benefits  $ 28  $ 30  $ 31  $ 32  $ 34  $ 183 
 
PENSION BENEFIT PLANS
We provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly the U.S., Ireland, Germany , and Israel. The substantial majority  of the plans' benefits have been
frozen and beginning on January 1, 2020, future benefit accruals for the U.S. Pension Plan will be frozen to remaining eligible employees, which reduced our projected benefit
obligation by $150 million  at December 29, 2018.

Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. W e use the corridor approach to amortize actuarial
gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis.
As of December 28, 2019 , all plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 29, 2018 , the accumulated
benefit obligations were $1.2 billion  and $2.0 billion  for the U.S. Pension Plan and non-U.S. plans, respectively . In 2018, the U.S. Pension Plan was in the net asset position and
all non-U.S. plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension
liabilities.
We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors
such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.
FUNDING
Policy . Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts suf ficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may
be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations; additional funding may be provided as
deemed appropriate.
Funding Status.  On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 65% funded as of December 28, 2019 . The U.S. Pension Plan, which accounts for 32% of the
worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 96% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to
fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for U.S. retirement plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative
company funding to the U.S. Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.
NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST
The net periodic benefit cost for pension and U.S. retiree medical benefits was $135 million  in 2019  ($197 million  in 2018  and $243 million  in 2017 ).

U.S. Plan Assets
The investment strategy for U.S. Pension Plan assets is to manage the funded status volatility , taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility to help
ensure that suf ficient assets are available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and
liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are approximately 90% fixed income and 10% equity investments. During 2019, the
U.S. Pension Plan assets were invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value.
Non-U.S. Plan Assets
The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country
where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified
insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we
have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct
investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and
to help ensure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over was
approximately 45% fixed income, 35% equity , and 20% hedge fund investments in 2019.
The equity investments in the non-U.S. plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the
world.
We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority  of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity
index funds.

NOTE 19 : EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS
 
Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Our plans
include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP .
Under the 2006 Plan, 866 million  shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2023. As
of December 28, 2019 , 228 million  shares of common stock remained available for future grant s.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements 105
Table of Contents
 
 
Under the 2006 Plan, we grant RSUs and stock options. W e grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, performance condition, and a service
condition, which we call PSUs. Prior to granting PSUs, we granted OSUs, which were RSUs with only market and service conditions. PSUs are granted to a group of senior
officers and employees. For PSUs granted in  2019 , the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount,
equally based on two metrics: our three-year cumulative non-GAAP EPS growth relative to a target rate and TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of
the S&P 500 IT Sector Index over a  three -year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 28,
2019 , 13 million  PSUs and OSUs were outstanding. The PSUs granted in 2019 vest three years from the grant date, and OSUs, which were granted prior to 2019, generally vest
three years and one month from the grant date. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over  four years  from the grant date. Stock options generally expire ten
years  from the date of grant.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSA TION
Share-based compensation recognized in 2019  was $1.7 billion  ($1.5 billion  in 2018 and $1.4 billion  in 2017). During 2019 , the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction
from share-based awards totaled $359 million  ($399 million  in 2018  and $520 million  in 2017 ).
We estimate the fair value of RSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of
dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. W e estimate the fair value of RSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model
on the date of grant using historical volatility .

The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2019  was $1.9 billion  ($2.0 billion  in 2018  and $1.6 billion  in 2017 ), which represents the market value of our common stock on
the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2019  was $1.3 billion  ($1.2 billion  in 2018  and $1.1 billion  in 2017 ). The number of RSUs vested
includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net
of estimated future forfeitures.
As of December 28, 2019 , unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $2.1 billion . We expect to recognize those costs
over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.
STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
The 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 ESPP , 373
million  shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2021. As of December 28, 2019 , 119 million  shares of common stock remained available for
issuance.
Employees purchased 17.1 million  shares of common stock in 2019  for $688 million  under the 2006 ESPP ( 13.7 million  shares of common stock for $468 million  in 2018  and
14.5 million  shares of common stock for $432 million  in 2017 ). As of December 28, 2019 , unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of
common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled  $42 million . We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months .

NOTE 20 : COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
COMMITMENTS
Commitments for construction or purchase of property , plant and equipment totaled $10.9 billion  as of December 28, 2019  ($9.0 billion  as of December 29, 2018 ), a substantial
majority  of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $2.8 billion  as of December 28, 2019  (approximately
$3.2 billion  as of December 29, 2018 ). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods
or services.  For further information on our lease commitments, see " Note 3: Recent Accounting Standards ."
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,
individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government
investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur . Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In
addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling
one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse
impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. W e might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our
stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below , we have not concluded that
settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.
European Commission Competition Matter
In 2001, the EC commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our
microprocessors. W e received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of
Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a
decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC T reaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82
(later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by of fering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86
microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival products." The EC imposed a fine in the
amount of €1.1 billion  ($1.4 billion  as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately bring to an end the infringement
referred to in" the EC decision.
The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should "cease and desist" from
further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law . We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review , to comply with that decision pending appeal.
We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.
We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June
2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety . In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for
Competitive T echnologies filed comments in support of Intel’ s grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and
the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General W ahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a
non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General
Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court has appointed a panel
of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC’ s 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice’ s clarifications of the law . In November 2017, the parties filed initial “Observations”
about the Court of Justice’ s decision and the appeal, and were invited by the General Court to of fer supplemental comments to each other ’s “Observations,” which the parties
submitted in March 2018. Responses to other questions posed by the General Court were filed in May and June 2018. The General Court has scheduled oral argument for
March 2020. Pending the final decision in this matter , the fine paid by Intel has been placed by the EC in commercial bank accounts where it accrues interest.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown”) that
affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to
verify the research, and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was
publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits relating to the Spectre and Meltdown
security vulnerabilities, as well as another variant of these vulnerabilities (“Foreshadow”) that has since been identified, have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our
current and former executives and directors, in U.S. federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries.
 
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to Financial Statements 107
Table of Contents
 
 
As of January 22, 2020 , consumer class action lawsuits relating to certain security vulnerabilities publicly disclosed in 2018 were pending in the U.S., Canada, and Israel. The
plaintif fs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the
security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the U.S., numerous individual class action
suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated in April 2018 for all pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Intel filed a motion to dismiss that
consolidated action in October 2018, and a hearing on that motion was held in February 2019. In Canada, in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, an
initial status conference has not yet been scheduled. In a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, the court has stayed the case until April 2020. In
Israel, both consumer class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Haifa. In the first case, the District Court denied the parties' joint motion to stay filed in January 2019,
but to date has deferred Intel's deadline to respond to the complaint in view of Intel's pending motion to dismiss in the consolidated proceeding in the U.S. Intel filed a motion to
stay the second case pending resolution of the consolidated proceeding in the U.S., and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for May 2020. Additional lawsuits and
claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. W e dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously . Given
the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that
uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal
issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any , that might arise from those matters.
In addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders have filed multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits since January 2018 against certain current and former members of our Board
of Directors and certain current and former of ficers, alleging that the defendants breached their duties to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and
the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. The complaints seek to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. Some of the derivative actions
were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and were consolidated, and the others were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California in San
Mateo County and were consolidated. The federal court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint in the federal action in August 2018 on the ground that
plaintif fs failed to plead facts suf ficient to show they were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. The federal court granted plaintif fs leave to amend their
complaint, but subsequently dismissed the cases without prejudice in January 2019 at plaintif fs' request. In August 2018, the California Superior Court granted defendants'
motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint in the state court action on the ground that plaintif fs failed to plead facts suf ficient to show they were excused from making a pre-
lawsuit demand on the Board, but granted plaintif fs leave to amend. In July 2019, the California Superior Court dismissed plaintif fs' amended complaint on the same grounds as
the previous complaint, but again granted plaintif fs leave to amend. In November 2019, the California Superior Court dismissed plaintif fs' second amended complaint on the
same grounds as the two previous complaints, but again granted plaintif fs leave to amend. Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintif fs' third amended complaint is scheduled for
hearing in March 2020.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Based on management’ s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are ef fective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and
communicated to management, including our principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter
ended December 28, 2019  that have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes
in accordance with U.S. GAAP .
Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 . Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission ( 2013 framework ). Management’ s assessment included evaluation of
elements such as the design and operating ef fectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ef fective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP .
We reviewed the results of management’ s assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Y oung LLP , independently assessed the ef fectiveness of the company’ s internal control over financial reporting, as
stated in the firm’ s attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.
INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS
Our management, including the principal executive of ficer and principal financial of ficer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system’ s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Further , because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , have been detected.

Exhibit 4.16
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Intel Corporation (“Intel”) has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”):
our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “common stock”).
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
The following summary description sets forth some of the general terms and provisions of the common stock. Because this is a summary description, it does not
contain all of the information that may be important to you. For a more detailed description of the common stock, you should refer to the provisions of our third
restated certificate of incorporation (the “certificate of incorporation”) and our bylaws, as amended and restated, each of which is an exhibit to the Annual
Report on Form 10-K to which this description is an exhibit.
General
Under the certificate of incorporation, Intel is authorized to issue up to 10 billion shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share and up to 50
million shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per shares (the “preferred stock”). The shares of common stock currently outstanding are fully paid
and nonassessable.  No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. The Board of Directors has the authority to repeal, alter or amend the bylaws or
adopt new bylaws, subject to certain limitations set forth in the bylaws.
No Preemptive, Redemption or Conversion Rights
The common stock is not redeemable, is not subject to sinking fund provisions, does not have any conversion rights and is not subject to call. Holders of shares
of common stock have no preemptive rights to maintain their percentage of ownership in future offerings or sales of stock of Intel.
Voting Rights
Holders of shares of common stock have one vote per share in all elections of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of Intel.
Holders of shares of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights.
Board of Directors
Our board of directors is not classified. Our bylaws establish that the size of the whole Board of Directors shall be not less than nine nor more than fifteen, with
the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time within such range by a duly adopted resolution of the Board of Directors. This range cannot be
altered without stockholder approval.
No Action by Stockholder Consent
The certificate of incorporation prohibits action that is required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of Intel from being
taken by the written consent of stockholders without a meeting.
Power to Call Special Stockholder Meeting
Under Delaware law, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by our board of directors or by any other person authorized to do so in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws. Pursuant to our bylaws, special meetings of the stockholders may be called, for any purpose or purposes, by the Chairman of the Board
of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors at any time. In addition, a special meeting of the stockholders of Intel
 
 
 
 
shall be called by the Board of Directors upon written request to the Corporate Secretary of one or more stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than
fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting.
Proxy Access Nominations
Under our bylaws, a stockholder (or a group of up to 20 stockholders) who has held at least 3% of our common stock for three years or more may nominate a
director and have that nominee included in our proxy materials, provided that the stockholder and nominee satisfy the requirements specified in our bylaws.
Any stockholder who intends to use these procedures to nominate a candidate for election to the Board of Directors for inclusion in our proxy statement must
satisfy the requirements specified in our bylaws.
Dividend Rights
Subject to the preferences applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as and
when declared, from time to time, by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor.
Liquidation, Dissolution or Similar Rights
Subject to the preferences applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Intel, the holders
of common stock will be entitled to participate equally and ratably, in proportion to the number of shares held, in the net assets of Intel available for distribution
to holders of stock of Intel.
Forum Selection Clause
Under our bylaws, , unless Intel consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for making certain types of claims
shall be the Delaware Court of Chancery (except that, in the event the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or
proceeding, then the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be the federal district court for the District of Delaware). This provision
applies to (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Intel, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director,
officer, employee or agent of Intel to Intel or our stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (c) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or Intel’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (d) any
action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware, or (e) any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term
is defined in Section 115 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
