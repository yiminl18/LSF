an foodservice and commercial baking industries. We manufacture our products in 13 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our

ldwide.We manage and review the 
financial results of our business under four operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; and Asia & Latin Am
erica. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of thisreport for a descript
ion of our segments and certain changes made to our segments in fiscal 2017. For financial information by segment and geographic area, seeNote 16 to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8 of this report.We offer a variety o
f food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience and value for consumers around the world, with a focus on five large global categories:
 
 
•  ready-to-eat cereal; 
 
•  convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees; 
 
•  snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks; 
 
•  yogurt; and 
 
•  super-premium ice cream.Other significant product 
categories include: 
 
•  baking mixes and ingredients; and 
 
•  refrigerated and frozen dough.Our Cereal Partners Worldwide 
(CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in th e ready-to-eat cereal category in markets outside North America, andour Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint v
enture competes in the super-premium ice cream category in Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products, see Note 16 to the Consolidat
ed Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Customers. 
Our primary customers are grocery s tores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, e-commercegrocery providers, commercial
 and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, and convenience stores. We gen erally sell to these customersthrough our direct sales fo
rce. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types of customers. For further information onour customer credit and 
product return practi ces, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. an
d its affiliates (Wal-Mart) accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 29 percent of net sales o f our North America Retailsegment. No other customer a
ccounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further information on significant customers, please refer to Note 7to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this report.Competition. 
The consumer foods industry is highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United Sta tes and throughout the world. Thefood categories in which we par
ticipate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and otherresources. 
Competition in our product ca tegories is based on product 
3

Table of Contentsinnovation, product quality, pr
ice, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumerpreferences. Our principal 
strategies for compe ting in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective customer relationships, superior productquality, innovative adver
tising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs, an efficient supply chain, and price. In most productcategories, we compete no
t only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that aregenerally sold at lower pr
ices. Internationally, we comp ete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group ofcompetitors.
Raw 
materials, ingredients, and packaging. The principal raw mate rials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits,meats, nuts, vegetable oi
ls, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities o f carton board, corrugated, plastic and metal packaging materials,operating supplies, and energy. Mos
t of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. In ourinternational opera
tions, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuatewidely due to external condi
tions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market f luctuations, currency fluctuations, and changesin governmental agricu
ltural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on theopen 
market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of itemssignificant to our business in o
rder to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our productionneeds at price levels 
that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extentpossible, we often manage the 
risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grainmerchandising operation 
that provides us efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity mark ets, principally wheat and oats. Thisoperation holds ph
ysical inventories that are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its marketexposures.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our research and developmen
t resources are focused on new produ ct development, product improvement, process design and improvement, packaging, andexploratory research 
in new business and technology areas. Research and development expenditures were $218 million in fiscal 2017, $222 million in fiscal 2016, and $229 million in fiscal 2015.

Table of ContentsWe continue our focus on develop
ing and marketing innovative, proprietary products. We consider the collective rights under our various paten ts, which expirefrom time to time, 
a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.SEASONALITY
In general, demand for our p
roducts is evenly balanced throughout th e year. However, within our North America Retail segment demand for refrigerated dough,frozen baked goods, and baking products 
is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso
 soup is higher during the fall and winter months.Internationally, within ou
r Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America segments, demand for Häagen-Dazs
 ice cream is higher du ring the summer months anddemand for baking mix and 
dough products increases during wint er months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different seasons inthe northern and southern hem
ispheres, our international segments’ net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year. BACKLOG
Orders are generally 
filled within a few days of r eceipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders as ofMay 28, 2017, was not material.

ITEM 1A
Risk Factors Our business is subject to various r
isks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, andresults of operations.
The food categories in which we participate are 
very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could beadversely affected.
The food categories in which 
we participate are very competiti ve. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and otherresources. In most product c
ategories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with g eneric andprivate label products 
that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brandrecognition and loyalty, e
ffectiveness of marketing, promotional  activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors wereto seek an advantage through pr
icing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitabi lity. If we didnot do the same, our revenues and 
market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are notsuccessful in introducing innov
ative products in response to changing consumer de mands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable tobuild and sustain brand equity by of
fering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.
We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the fac
e of a consolidating retail environment.There has been significan
t consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to 
improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increasedemphasis on generic and othe
r economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation,knowledge of consumers’ needs, and c
ategory leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any la
rge customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart accounted for 20percent of our consolidat
ed net sales and 29 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segm ent. For more information on significant customers, please seeNote 7 to the Consolidated Financia
l Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Table of ContentsPrice changes for the commoditi
es we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability. The principal raw materials t
hat we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarci ty, limitedsources of supply, commodity ma
rket fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations.Commodity price changes may 
result in unexpected increases in raw material, packag ing, and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset theseincreased costs or incr
ease our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedu
res that we do use may not always work as we intend.Volatility in the market value of der
ivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity pric es will cause volatility in our gross margins andnet earnings.
We utilize derivatives to manage 
price risk for some of our p rincipal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principallysoybean), dairy products, natur
al gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in vo latility in bothgross margin and net earnings. Th
ese gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate itemsoutside our segment operat
ing results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified tosegment operating profit.
 We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.
If we are not efficient in our production, our profi
tability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. Our future success and earnings g
rowth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our produc ts in highly competitivemarkets. Gaining additiona
l efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundantcosts resulting from acqu
isitions or divestitures could advers ely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involvecomplex reorganizat
ion of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of produc tion, which maynegatively impact produ
ct volume and margins. We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase ourefficiency and reduc
e expenses. If we are unable to execute those initi atives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which couldadversely affect our bus
iness and results of operations.Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.
Our ability to make, move, and s
ell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distributioncapabilities due to weather
, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import/exportrestrictions, or other factor
s could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location. Oursuppliers’ policies and pr
actices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood orpotential impact of su
ch events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, couldadversely affect our bus
iness and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certa
in food products or ingredients. We could be adversely af
fected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types o
f concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.If our food products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabel
ed, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims ifconsumers are injured.
We may need to recal
l some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in signific ant lossesdue to the costs of a reca
ll, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer lossesfrom a significant produ
ct liability judgment against us. A signific ant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to ourreputation, and a loss of consum
er confidence in our food products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our b rands.

Table of ContentsWe may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer prefer
ences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our abi
lity to anticipate the tastes, eating habits and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that app eal to theirpreferences in channe
ls where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number ofdifferent trends and other
 factors. If we fail to anticipate, identi fy or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or tointroduce new and improved produc
ts on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suff
er. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, transfats, genetically mod
ified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients o r attributes.We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster g
rowing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potentia
l is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populat ionsare growing in the markets 
that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and moreprofitable categories. Our
 future results will also depend on our ability to incr ease market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed indeveloping innovative products 
for new and existing categories, our growth may slow, which could adversely affect our profitability.Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.
The willingness of consumers to pur
chase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchasemore generic, privat
e label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction insales of higher margin produ
cts or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of e conomic conditions or competitive actions, wemay be unable to raise our p
rices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customersthat purchase 
products from our Convenience Stor es & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our results may be negatively impact
ed if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.Maintaining and continual
ly enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers 
react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, includingconsumer perception tha
t we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, thefailure of our products to d
eliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers.Consumer demand for our products m
ay also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The growing use of social and digitalmedia by consumers, us, and third p
arties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts orcomments about us, our brands, or our p
roducts on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorableperception of our brands, 
our business results could be nega tively impacted.Our international operations are subject to pol
itical and economic risks.In fiscal 2017, 29 percent of ou
r consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business international
ly, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: 
•
 political and economic instability;•
 exchange controls and currency exchange rates;•
 nationalization of operations;•
 compliance with anti-corruption regulations;•
 foreign tax treaties and policies; and•
 restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.Our financial perform
ance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause materialvariations in our results o
f operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chineserenminbi, euro, Japanese yen, M
exican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure tocurrency fluctuations, b
ut these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.

Table of ContentsNew regulations or regulatory-based claims could advers
ely affect our business.Our facilities and produc
ts are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and DrugAdministration, the Occupat
ional Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production,packaging, labelling, stor
age, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of ou r employees. Our failure to comply with such lawsand regulations could subjec
t us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise ourproducts and could be the targ
et of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also besubject to new laws or regulat
ions restricting our right to advertise our products, including proposals to limi t advertising to children. Changes in laws or regulationsthat impose additional 
regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to beadversely affected.
We are subject to var
ious federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regu lationscould subject us to lawsuits, adm
inistrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due toregulatory complexities, u
ncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk o f unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential existsfor remediation, liability, in
demnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these m atters, orcompliance with environm
ental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adverse
ly affect our ability to paydividends.
As of May 28, 2017, we had total debt, redee
mable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $10.8 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us fro
m incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our: 
•
 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debtsecurities by rating org
anizations were revised downward; and •
 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.There are various finan
cial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of theserequirements, the re
lated indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtainadditional or altern
ative financing may also be adversely affected.Our ability to make schedul
ed payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing e
conomic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.Global capital and credit market issues 
could negatively affect our liquidity, inc rease our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliersand customers.
We depend on 
stable, liquid, and well-fun ctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financialassets, access to capital a
nd credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be noassurance that future vo
latility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interestrate 
derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs ofborrowing. Our business could also be negat
ively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions re sulting from tighter capital and credit markets ora slowdown in the general economy.
Volatility in the securities 
markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit,and postemployment benefit costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, seve
rance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globallydiversified portfolio o
f securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care cost s, early retirement rates, investment returns, andthe market value of pl
an assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future fundingrequirements of the pl
ans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations andcash flows from operations.

Table of ContentsOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology syste
ms fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology 
serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, 
to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and taxrequirements. Our inform
ation technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effecti vely manage our key business processes including digital marketing,order entry and fulfil
lment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our lo
cations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees,consumers, and proprietary bus
iness information. Our information technology systems, some of which a re dependent on services provided by third parties, may bevulnerable to damage, in
terruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, sec
urity breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose apotential risk to the se
curity and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confid entiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on thosesystems. The failure of our 
information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, da
ta loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technologysystems could have 
operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a mate rial adverse effect on our business.A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a di
fferent weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangibl
e assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.As of May 28, 2017, we had $12.9 billion of goodwill and inde
finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the net assets of areporting unit, including goodwil
l, to the fair value of the unit. If the fair value of the net assets of the r eporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill,impairment has occur
red. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determinedusing inputs from our long-range p
lanning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and otherfactors. Our Latin Americ
a and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we continu e to monitor these businesses. Whilewe currently believe th
at our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significantimpairment losses.
We evaluate the useful lives
 of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Pillsbury
 , Totino’s
, Progresso
, Yoplait
, Old
El
Paso
, Yoki
, Häagen-Dazs
, and Annie’s
brands, to determine if t hey are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the fu
ture effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technologicaladvances, legislative 
action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of requiredmaintenance expenditu
res, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.Our indefinite-lived intan
gible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our 
estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from ourlong-range plan, assumed roya
lty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rat e. While not impaired as of May 28, 2017, theImmaculate

brands had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwi
ll and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.Our failure to successfully integ
rate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.From time to time, we eva
luate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired 
and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risksassociated with acquisit
ions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers o f the acquired business, the assumption of unknownliabilities, the inh
erent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieveanticipated synergies, an
d the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a global consume
r foods company. We develop distinc tive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuouslyto improve our core products 
and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-d
irected marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winningand sustaining leading share pos
itions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financi
al goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment opera tingprofit, earnings per shar
e (EPS), free cash flow, cash return to shareholders, and return on average total capital are key drivers of financial performance for ourbusiness.
Our long-term growth objectiv
es are to consistently deliver: 
•
 low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales; 
•
 mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit on a constant-currency basis; 
•
 high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability on a constant-currency basis; 
•
 improvement in adjusted return on average total capital; 
•
 free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and 
•
 cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.We believe that this financial 
performance should result in long-term value creation for shareholders.Fiscal 2017 was a year of signifi
cant change for General Mills. We implemented a new global organizational structure to enhance our agility in a rapidly changing consumer environment. We 
expanded our global supply chain restructuring initiative to further increase our efficiency. We also implemented a business plan thataggressively shifted resou
rces to our best growth opportunities and eliminated low-retu rn investments and volume. While these actions were the right thing to dofor our company, we did not execut
e up to our standards in certain areas and our results did not meet our expectations. Consolidated net sales and total segment operating profit growth fe
ll short of our plans, largely because of competitive price gaps in our North American Retail segment. We underestimated the impact thatour aggressive reductions in p
romotional spending, implemented early in the fiscal year, would have on ou r net pricing relative to competitors. The gaps were mostpronounced in the U.S. Meals & Baking opera
ting unit, and competitive activity also significantly impacted U.S. Yogurt. We took corrective actions to improve our performance in the se
cond half of fiscal 2017, but it was not sufficient to stem the early declines. Yogurt in the Europe & Australia segment also did not meetexpectations as compet
itive pressure from smaller branded players increased significan tly. Excluding yogurt, the segment’s net sales and share increased driven byice cream and snack ba
rs innovation and improved merchandising performance. In the Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment, segment operating profit grew driven by lower input costs and bene
fits from cost savings initiatives. Net sales for the Focus 6 platforms grew modestly, but were more than offset by market indexpricing on flour. In the Asia & L
atin America segment, macroeconomi c weakness in Latin America and the Middle East created a challenging environment whilegreater China returned 
to net sales growth, including contributions from the new Yoplait business. We continued to realize planned benefits from our numerous restructuring initi
atives and cost reduction efforts in our supply chain and administrative areas which helped us to increase our adjusted operating profit margin andadjusted diluted earnings p
er share (EPS) in fiscal 2017.Our consolidated net sales fo
r fiscal 2017 declined 6 percent to $15.6 billion, primarily driven by declining contributions from volume, including the impact of the divestiture of the North Ame
rican Green Giant product lines (Green Giant). On an organic basis, net sales decreased 4 percent. Operating profit of $2.6 billiondecreased 5 percent. Tot
al segment operating profit of $3.0 billion declined 2 percent and declined 1 pe rcent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $2.77was flat compared to fis
cal 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability of results, rose 5 percent to $3.08 per share andincreased 6 percent on a 
constant-currency basis. Our return on average total capital was 12.7 percent, and adjusted return on average total capital increased 30basis points to 11.6 percent and in
creased 40 basis points on a constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below fo r discussion of totalsegment operating profi
t, adjusted diluted EPS, organic net sales growth rate, constant-currency total segment operating profit growth rate, constant-currencyadjusted 
diluted EPS growth rate, and adjusted return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).Net cash 
provided by operations total ed $2.3 billion in fiscal 2017 at a conversion rate of 136 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemableand noncontrolling interes
ts. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $684 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $1.6 billion at aconversion rate of 86 perc
ent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned significant cashto 
shareholders through a 6 percent dividend increase and share repurchases totaling $1,652 million. Total cash returned to shareholders represented 164 percent ofour free cash flow (see th

Table of ContentsA detailed review of our fis
cal 2017 performance appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2017 Consolidated Results of Operations.” We remain commit
ted to our Consumer First strategy and our focus on driving growth and returns for our shareholders. Our top priority in fiscal 2018 is to makesignificant strides towa
rd returning our business to sustainable topline growth. Our fiscal 2018 plans call for investment in product news and innovation toaccelerate growth fo
r businesses where we have positive momentu m, and to improve those that are underperforming. We will also increase investment incapabilities like e-commerce and 
Strategic Revenue Management, which are critical to future growth. We will continue to prioritize resources against our Growth platforms, where we see the s
trongest profitable growth potential. And we will make selective investments in our Foundation brands while focusing on profitabilityand cash generation.
We plan to continue to driv
e efficiency in fiscal 2018, including delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings through our ongoing Holistic Margin Managemen
t (HMM) efforts. We also expect to deliver approximately $160 million in incremental savings from our other restructuring and cost-reduction initiativ
es, which equates to approximately $700 million in savings versus fiscal 2015 levels. These sav ings should more than offset our estimate of3 percent input cost infl
ation.This cost management disc
ipline has helped us significantly expand our ad justed operating profit margin over the past two years. We continue to see opportunitiesfor further margin exp
ansion, including an increase in adjusted operating profit margin in fiscal 2018, but we will moderate the pace of expansion as we invest to restore topline growth. Looking fo
rward, we are focused on delivering a balance of sales growth and margin expansion, along with strong cash conversion and cashreturns, to create top
-tier returns for our shareholders. With these assumptions in m
ind: 
 
•  We expect fiscal 2018 organic net sales to decline between 1 and 2 percent from fiscal 2017 levels. 
 
•  We expect fiscal 2018 total segment operating profit will be in a range between flat and up 1 percent on a constant-currency basis. 
 
•  We expect fiscal 2018 adjusted diluted EPS to increase 1 to 2 percent in constant currency from the base of $3.08 earned in fiscal 2017. 
 
• Our plans call for continued strong cash returns to shareholders. The current annualized dividend rate of $1.96 per share is up 2 percent from theannual dividend paid in fisc
al 2017. Share repurchases in fiscal 2018 are expected to resul t in a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding ofapproximately 1 to 2 perc
ent.See the “Non-GAAP 
Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP.Certain terms used throughout 
this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this r eport.FISCAL 2017 CONSOL
IDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFiscal 2017 includes an addition
al month of results from General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) (please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 of 
this report).In fiscal 2017, operating r
esults reflected challenging net sales performance. However, we continued to make progress against our cost savings and marginexpansion initiatives. The n
et sales decline of 6 percent was driven by declining contributions from volume in the North America Retail and Europe & Australiasegments including the 
impact of the divesti ture of Green Giant in fiscal 2016, which were partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. Operatingprofit margin of 16.4 perc
ent was up 10 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimization initiatives, andfavorable net price 
realization, partially offset by the gain from the Green Giant divestiture. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to18.1 percent, driven by benefi
ts from cost savings and spending optimization initiatives and favorable net price realization. Diluted earnings per share of $2.77 wasflat to fiscal 2016 and ad
justed diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting co mparability, on a constant-currency basis increased 6 percent compared tofiscal 2016 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” s

decreased $678 million in fiscal 2017 to $10,056 million. The decrease included an $814 million decrease attributable to lower volume and a $137 million increase attributable to 
product rate and mix. We recorded a $14 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certaincommodity positions and grain 
inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of$63 million in fiscal 2016. In

ances.Our consolidated 
effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 28.8 percent compared to 31.4 percent in fiscal 2016. The 2.6 p ercentage point decrease was primarily dueto non-deductible expenses r

Our consolidated 
effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 31.4 percent compared to 33.3 percent in fiscal 2015. The 1.9 percentage point dec rease was primarily dueto the unfavorable impa

In the third quarter of 
fiscal 2017, we announced a new global organization structure to streamline our leadership, enhance global scale, and drive improvedoperational agility 
to maximize our growth capabilities. As a result of this global reorganization, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we reported resultsfor our four operating segm
ents as follows: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Austr alia; and Asia & Latin America. We haverestated our net sales by s
egment and segment operating profit amounts to reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated ne
t sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share.Our North America 
Retail operating segmen t consists of our former U.S. Retail operating units and our Canada region. Within our North America Retail operatingsegment, our former U.S. Meals ope
rating unit and U.S. Baking operating unit have been combined into one operating unit: U.S. Meals & Baking. Our Convenience Stores & Foodservice ope
rating segment was unchanged. Our Europe & Australia operating segment consists of our former Europe region. OurAsia & Latin America 
operating segment consists o f our former Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions.

for fiscal 2016 declined 42 per cent to $69 million from $120 million in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by increased SG&A expenses,unfavorable foreign cur

Unallocated corporate 
items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the GeneralMills Foundation,
 asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that arenot part of our measurem
ent of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to -market valuation of certain commodity positionsuntil passed back to our opera

corporate expense totaled $190 million compared to $289 million last year. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a $14 million net decrease in expense related to ma
rk-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $63 million net decrease in expense in the prioryear. In addition, we record
ed $42 million of restructuring charges, and $44 million of restructuring initiative pr oject-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017,compared to $78 million of 
restructuring charges and $58 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016. The decrease inunallocated corporat
e expense also reflects lower incentive expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.For fiscal 2016, unallocated 
corporate expense totaled $289 mill ion compared to $414 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, we recorded a $63 million net decreasein expense related to m

restructuring charges and $13 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. We recorded an $8million foreign exchange l
oss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary in fiscal 2015. We also recorded $16 million ofintegration costs resul
ting from the acquisition of Annie’s in fiscal 2015. The decrease in unallocated corporate expense also reflects cost savings from ProjectCatalyst and other cost 
management initiatives. IMPACT OF INFLATION
Our 
gross margin performance reflects the impact of 1 percent input cost inflation in fiscal 2017, 2 percent in fiscal 2016, and 2 percent in fiscal 2015, primarily oncommodity inputs. We expec

iquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $7.5 billion in cash. Asubstantial portion of this op
erating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fundour capital expenditur
es and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance significant acquisitions and majorcapital expansions.
As of May 28, 2017, we had $703 million of cash and c
ash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions, which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions. There is currently no need 
to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions. If we choose to repatriatehistorical earnings he
ld in foreign jurisdictions, we intend to do so only in a tax-neutral manner.

           In fiscal 2017, cash provided by ope
rations was $2.3 billion compared to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2016. The $316 million decrease is primar ily driven by a $490million change in curr
ent assets and liabilities. The $490 million change in current assets and liabilities is primarily due to changes in other current liabilities drivenby changes in income taxes 
payable, a decrease in incentive accruals and changes in trade and advertising accruals due to reduced spending. The change in currentassets and liabiliti
es was also impacted by the timing of accounts payable. Additionally, we recorded a $14 million loss on a divestitu re during fiscal 2017,compared to a $148 million n
et gain on divestitures during fiscal 2016 and classified the related cash flows as investing activities.We strive to grow core working c
apital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2017, core working capital increased 9 percent, primarily due to timing of accounts rec
eivable and inventory build late in fiscal 2017, compared to a net sales decline of 6 percent. In fiscal 2016, core working capital decreased 41percent, compared to a n

        In fiscal 2016, we entered in
to a $2.7 billion fee-paid committed credit facility that was originally scheduled to expire in May 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we amended the c
redit facility’s expiration date by one year to May 2022.To ensure availability 
of funds, we maintain bank cred it lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We hav
e commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and as set-backed credit lines thatsupport our foreign
 operations. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5times.
Certain of our long-term d
ebt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2017, we were in compliance with all of 
these covenants.We have $605 million of long-
term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 1.4 per cent notes due October 2017and $100 million of 6.39 percent 
fixed rate medium term notes due for remarketing in February 2018. We believe that cash flows from operations, together withavailable short- and long
-term debt financing, will be adequ ate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.As of May 28, 2017, our total debt, 
including the impact of d erivative instruments designated as hedges, was 67 percent in fixed-rate and 33 percent in floating-rateinstruments, compared to 78 p
ercent in fixed-rate and 22 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 29, 2016.Return on average total c
apital was 12.7 percent in fiscal 2017 compared to 12.9 percent in fiscal 2016. Improvement in adjusted return on average total capital is one of our key performance 
measures (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Adjustedreturn on average tota
l capital increased 30 basis points from 11.3 percent in fiscal 2016 to 11.6 p ercent in fiscal 2017 as fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings increased.On a constant-currency basis, 
adjusted return on average total capital increased 40 basis points.We also believe that ou
r fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fis
cal 2017 was 7.26 compared to 7.40 in fiscal 2016. The measure decreased from fiscal 2016 as earnings before income taxes and after-taxearnings from joint ventu
res decreased by $132 million in fiscal 2017. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio dec reased 6.8 percentage points to 24.4 percent infiscal 2017, driven by a decr
ease in cash provided by operations and an increase in notes payable.We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these
 entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in YoplaitMarques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl as 
noncontrolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our ConsolidatedBalance Sheets. These euro- and Can
adian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its 
redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. As of May 28, 2017, the redemption valueof the redeemable in
terest was $911 million which approximates its fair value. The third-party holder of 
the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from avai lable net income based on theapplication of a floating 
preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252million). On June 1, 2015, 
the floating prefer red return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. Thepreferred return r
ate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.We have an option to purchase 
the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account valu e, plus any unpaid preferred return and theprescribed make-whole a
mount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directlyto retained 
earnings and will increas e or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period.

The majority of the purch ase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and forconsumer marketing spending 
commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arr angements are considered purchase obligations if acontract specifies all significant

arrangements are c ancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated BalanceSheets as accounts payable and 
accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.(d)
The fair value of our for eign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $24 million as ofMay 28, 2017, based on fair market v

ts in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including theunderfunded status 
of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities.We expect to pay $21 mill
ion of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $14.6 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2018. Weare unable to reliab
ly estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2018. As of May 28, 2017, our total liability for uncertain tax positions andaccrued interest and penalties 
was $158.6 million.

Table of ContentsSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
 ESTIMATESFor a complete descript
ion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates 
are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include ouraccounting for promotiona
l expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, rede emable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, anddefined benefit pension, oth
er postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.Promotional Expenditures
Our promotional 
activities are condu cted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers toperform merchandising 
activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower r etail shelf prices; payments to gaindistribution of new products; coupons, 
contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The recognition of these costs requires estimation ofcustomer 
participation and per formance levels. These estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotionalactivities, and other factors
. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.Our accrued trade, coupon, and consu
mer marketing liabilities were $483 million as of May 28, 2017, and $564 million as of May 29, 2016. Because our totalpromotional expenditures 
(including amounts classi fied as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to makeadjustments in subsequent per
iods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We estimate the 
useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carr
ying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discoun ted cash flows orindependent appraisals, as 
appropriate.Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other indefinite
-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that impairment
 may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cashflow model. We use inputs from ou
r long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates,perpetuity growth assumptions, m
arket comparables, and other factors.We evaluate the 
useful lives of our other in tangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful liferequires significant 
judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, othe r economic factors (such as the stability ofthe industry, known technological 
advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distributionchannels), the 
level of required ma intenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definitelives are amortiz
ed on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is basedon a discounted cash flow model using 
inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did notown the 
brands, and a discount rate. As of May 28, 2017, we had $12.9 billion of goodwill and inde
finite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value o f each intangibleexceeds its carrying va
lue and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding futureperformance of our business
es or a different weighted-average cost of  capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performedour fiscal 2017 assessment of ou
r intangible assets as of August 29, 2016. As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangibleassets as their rela
ted fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the Latin America reporting unit and the Immaculate
Baking
 brand intangible asset. The exc
ess fair value above the carrying value o f the Latin America reporting unit and the Immaculate

Table of ContentsRedeemable Interest
In fiscal 2017, we adjusted the 
redemption value of Sodiaal’s redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The significantassumptions used to estimat
e the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation andtaxes, foreign currency 
exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 28, 2017, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $911 million.Stock-based Compensation
The valuation of stock options is 
a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statem
ents. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and theforfeiture rate. For more inf
ormation on these assumptions, please refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financia l Statements in Item 8 of this report.The estimated fair v
alues of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option -pricing model were as follows: 
 
  Fiscal Year    
  2017   2016   2015 Estimated fair valu
es of stock options granted   $8.80     $7.24    $7.22 Assumptions:
      Risk-free interest rate
   1.7%     2.4%    2.6% Expected term
   8.5 years    8.5 years    8.5 years Expected volatility
   17.8%    17.6%    17.5% Dividend yield
   2.9%     3.2%    3.1%   
             The risk-free inter
est rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effec t at the time of grant.An increase in the expect
ed term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 1 percent. If all other assumptionsare held constant, a one pe
rcentage point increase in our fisca l 2017 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2017 option awardsby 7 percent.
To the extent 
that actual outcomes d iffer from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values.However, these differe
nces can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in th e following two paragraphs.Furthermore, historica
l data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience couldlead to prospective rev
isions in our assumptions, which could then sign ificantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.Any corporate income tax 
benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall taxbenefit) is presented 
in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows wil l depend, in part, onthe volume of employee sto
ck option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and theoriginal grant-date fair 
value previously determ ined for financial reporting purposes.Realized windfall tax be
nefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Real ized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which areless than that previously r
ecognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to incometax expense, potentially 
resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within ourcontrol, it is possible tha
t significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.See the new accounting requir
ements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments in the Recently Issued Accounting Pronounc ements sectionbelow for forthcoming changes 
to stock-based compensation.
Income TaxesWe apply a more-like
ly-than-not threshold to the recognit ion and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit thathas a greater than 50 per
cent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate re solution ofuncertain tax positions wil
l affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please refer to Note 14 to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8 of this report.

ts provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make variousassumptions to predict and m
easure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant managementjudgment and have a material
 impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accu mulated benefit obligations include the long-termrates of return on plan ass
ets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected 
rate of return on plan a ssets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-termreturns by asset class (using 
input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-ter m inflation assumptions. We review thisassumption annually for ea
ch plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.Our historical investmen
t returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 11.8 percent, 10.0 percent, 6.0 per
cent, 8.4 percent, and 8.4 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 31, 2017.On a 
weighted-average basis, th e expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 8.17 percent for fiscal 2017, 8.53 percent for fiscal 2016, and 8.53 percentfor fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2018, we 
lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our p rincipal defined benefit pension and otherpostretirement plans 
in the United States to 7.95 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio.Lowering the expected long-t
erm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $66 million for fiscal 2018. A market-related va
luation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or lossesover a five-year per
iod from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculatedusing the market-related value
 of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annu
al expense or income.Discount Rates
Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed th
e method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our internation
al defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach toestimate service 
cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used t o determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projectedcash flows. This method provides a mo
re precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to thecorresponding rate on the yi
eld curve. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yieldcurve used to measure the b
enefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect th e measurement of our benefit obligations related to theseplans. We have accounted fo
r this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The change in methodologyresulted in a decreas
e in service and interest cost of approximately $68 million in fiscal 2017 compared to what our costs would have been under the previousmethod. The fiscal 2017 reduc
tion in our net periodic benefit expense as a result of this change in methodology was parti ally offset by a reduction in our weighted-average expected ra
te of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 8.25 percent as a resultof 
changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio.
Our discount rate assumptions are determ ined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit planobligations. We work with our outside 
actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan pa rticipants and, using the Aa AboveMedian corporate bond yield, 
to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve isapplied to our 
expected future cash out flows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

imately $85 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over theaverage remaining service perio
d of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates
We 
review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided byour actuaries. This infor
mation includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and pro jections, and assumptions used by other similarorganizations. Our initia
l health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations.Our 
initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.3 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 7.0 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2017. Ratesare graded down annually until 
the ultimate trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2024 for all retirees. T he trend rates are applicable for calculations only if theretirees’ benefits increase as a re
sult of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term i
nflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amountsreported for the other p
ostretirement benefit plans.A one percentage point change 
in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

laims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gainsand losses are amortiz
ed using a straight-line method over 10 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded.Financial Statement Impact
In fiscal 2017, we recorded 
net defined benefit pens ion, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $56 million compared to $163million of expense in fis
cal 2016 and $153 million of expense in fiscal 2015. As of May 28, 2017, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial  net losses of $1.6billion on our defined benef
it pension plans and $24 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increasesfrom lower interest rates, 
partially offset by r ecent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in ourfuture pension and postreti
rement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. Actual future net defin
ed benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in 
future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans.

Table of ContentsRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRON
OUNCEMENTSIn March 2017, the Financial Accoun
ting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefitpension expense, net periodic pos
tretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense. The new standard requires the service costcomponent of net periodic b
enefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation cos ts within our Consolidated Statements ofEarnings. Other components of net p
eriodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Inaddition, the new 
standard requires that on ly the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. We recognized net periodicbenefit expense of $56 mil
lion in fiscal 2017, $163 million in fiscal 2016, and $153 million in fiscal 2015 of which $141 million, $161 million, and $167 million,respectively, rela
ted to service cost. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of thisnew standard. The 
requirements of the new st andard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within thoseannual periods, which for us is the 
first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted.In January 2017, the FASB issued new accounting requi
rements related to goodwill impairment testing. The new standard eliminates the requirement to measure agoodwill impairment loss by de
termining the implied fair value of goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment losses will be measured by the amount by which areporting unit’s carry
ing value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill alloc ated to the reporting unit. The requirements of the newstandard are effec
tive for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, which for us is fiscal 2021. Earlyadoption is permitted. W
e intend to adopt this standard in fiscal 2018 and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations orfinancial position.
In October 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requi
rements related to the recognition of income taxes resulting from intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This will result in 
the recognition of the income tax consequences resulting from the intra-entity transfer of assets in our Consolidated Statements ofEarnings in the period of the 
transfer. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annua l reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, andinterim periods within thos
e annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of analyzing theimpact of this standard on ou
r results of operations and financial position.In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requi
rements for the accounting and presentat ion of stock-based payments. This will result in realized windfalland shortfall tax benef
its upon exercise or vesting of stock-based awards being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings instead of additional paid-in capital within our Consolidat
ed Balance Sheets. In addition, realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits will be reclassified from financing activities to operatingactivities in our Consolida
ted Statements of Cash Flows. We recognized windfall tax benefits of $64 million in fiscal 2017, $94 million in fiscal 2016, and $75million in fiscal 2015. Thes
e amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standardas windfall and shortfall 
tax benefits are dependent upon future stock prices, employee exercise behavior, and applicable tax rates. The requirements of the newstandard are effec
tive for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the firstquarter of fiscal 2018.
In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting 
requirements for ac counting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in most leases beingcapitalized as a r
ight of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning a
fter December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are in theprocess of evaluating le
ase accounting software and analyzing the impact o f this standard on our results of operations and financial position. Based on ourassessment to date, we expec
t this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the amount of our lease commitments but we are unable to quantify t
he impact at this time.In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting require
ments for the recognition of revenue from contrac ts with customers. The requirements of the new standardand its subsequent amendments 
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods,which for 
us is the first quarter o f fiscal 2019. We are in the process of documenting the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices inorder to identify mat
erial differences, if any, that would result from applying the new requirements to our rev enue contracts. We continue to make progress on ourrevenue recognition rev
iew and are also in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, on changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to supportrecognition 
and disclosure requirem ents under the new guidance. In addition, we continue to assess our adoption approach. Based on our assessment to date, we donot expect this guidance to h
ave a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Financial Measures Our fiscal 2018 outlook for organi
c net sales growth, constant-currency total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted operating profit margin are non-GAAP financial m
easures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currencyexchange rate fluctuations,
 restructuring charges and project-relat ed costs, and commodity mark-to-market effects. Our fiscal 2018 outlook for organic net salesgrowth also excludes the eff
ect of acquisitions and divestitures. We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their mostdirectly comparabl
e forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certaintythe actual impact of changes
 in foreign currency exchange rates and commod ity prices or the timing of acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actionsthroughout fiscal 2018. The unavai
lable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2018 GAAP financial results.For fiscal 2018, we currently exp
ect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions), acquisitions, anddivestitures to have an
 immaterial impact on net sales growth; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on total segment operating profit andadjusted diluted EPS growth; and tota
l restructuring charges and project-related costs related to actions pr eviously announced to total approximately $45 million.

on to publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or 
unanticipated events.Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disc
losures About Market Risk We are exposed to marke
t risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our 
earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into varioushedging transactions, author
ized under established policies that place clear controls on the se activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highlyrated institutions. We 
establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For informat
ion on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements in Item 8 of 
this report.VALUE AT RISK
The estimates in the t
able below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates,foreign exchange rates, 
commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market r
isk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.The VAR calculation used historic
al interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these 
rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses infair value that we expe
ct to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the deriv ative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect thatany loss or gain in the fair v
alue of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in the calcul
ations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures and options; and equityinstruments. The calcul
ations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities o r equity-related positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

Integrated Framework
(2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Org anizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). General Mills, Inc.’s management is responsiblefor these consolidated f
inancial statements and financial statement sched ule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for itsassessment of the effectivene
ss of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9a Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibi
lity is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on theCompany’s internal control ov
er financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require tha t weplan and perform the au
dits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng was maintained in all material respec ts. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis,evidence supporting the amoun
ts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evalua
ting the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understandingof internal control ove
r financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material we akness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness ofinternal control based on 
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinions.A company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide re asonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand dispositions of the assets of 
the Company; (2) provide reasonabl e assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financialstatements in accord
ance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in ac cordance withauthorizations of manag
ement and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition o
f the Company’s assets t hat could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent o r detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In our opinion, t
he consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financi al position of General Mills, Inc. andsubsidiaries as of May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016, and 
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period endedMay 28,

 the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Alsoin our opinion, General Mills, In

Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements
GENERAL MILLS, 
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTE 1. 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASS IFICATIONSBasis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial State
ments include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.Intercompany transac
tions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.Our fiscal year ends on the l
ast Sunday in May. Fiscal years 2017 and 2016 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2015 consisted of 53 weeks.Change in Reporting Period
As part of a long-term 
plan to conform the fisc al year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2017 we changed the reporting period of General Mills Brasil AlimentosLtda (Yoki) within our Asia & Latin Am
erica segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our f iscal calendar. Accordingly, in fiscal2017, our results included 13 months of 
results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated results of operations.Our General Mills 
India business remains on an Apri l fiscal year end.In fiscal 2016 we changed the r
eporting period of Yoplait SAS and Yoplait Marques SNC within our Europe & Australia segment and Annie’s, Inc. (Annie’s)within our North America Retai
l segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in fiscal 2016, ourresults included 
13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated results of operations.Certain 
reclassifications to our pre viously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation.NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all invest
ments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Inventories
All inventories in the United St
ates other than grain are va lued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories arevalued at net realizable value,
 and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.Inventories outside of the Uni
ted States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.Shipping costs associated with the d
istribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are re cognized when the related finishedproduct is shipped to and accep
ted by the customer.Land, Buildings, Equipment, and 
Depreciation Land is recorded at histor
ical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost and depr eciated overestimated useful liv
es, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciatedover 40 years, and equipment, fu
rniture, and software are usually depr eciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipmentuntil disposal. When
 an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any,are recognized in ea
rnings. As of May 28, 2017, assets held for sale were insignificant.Long-lived assets are 
reviewed for impairm ent whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may notbe recoverable. An impai
rment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of th e asset group areless than the carrying a
mount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of animpairment loss would be based on 
the excess of the carrying a mount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flowmodel or independent appra
isals, as appropriate. 
55

Table of ContentsGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not subject to amort
ization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may haveoccurred. In fiscal 2016, we ch
anged the date of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment from the first day of the thirdquarter to the first d
ay of the second quarter to more closely align with the timing of our annual long-range planning p rocess. Impairment testing is performed foreach of our reporting units. 
We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assetsand 
liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If thecarrying amount of a repo
rting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair valueof the net assets is grea
ter than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill, impairment has occur
red. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determinedusing inputs from our long-range p
lanning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetui ty growth assumptions, market comparables, and otherfactors.
We evaluate the usefu
l lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if t hey are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful liferequires significant 
judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological 
advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distributionchannels), the level of 
required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definitelives are amortiz
ed on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.Our indefinite-lived in
tangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Pillsbury
 , Totino’s
, Progresso
, Yoplait
, Old
El
Paso
, Yoki
, Häagen-Dazs
, and Annie’s
brands, are also tested fo r impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not berecoverable. Our estim
ate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty 
rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. Our finite-lived intangible
 assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indic
ate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted futurecash flows from the operat
ion and disposition of the asset are less than the car rying amount of the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and arelargely independent of oth
er assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a dis
counted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.Investments in 
Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Our investments in companies ov
er which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or losses.We receive royalty income from certai
n joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development), and record the tax impact of certain jointventure operations that 
are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sellcertain raw mater
ials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.In addition, we assess our investm
ents in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, proje
cted decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted average cost of capital, or significant business disruptions. The significantassumptions used to estimat
e fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royal ty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchangerates, and a discount rat
e. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value o
f the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fairvalue if we concluded the i
mpairment is other than temporary.
Redeemable InterestWe have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put al
l or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. This putoption requires us to classi
fy Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equi ty on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable bySodiaal. When the put is no longer 
exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the
 redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemptionvalue, which approximates i
ts fair value. During the second and third quarters of fis cal 2017, we adjusted the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on adiscounted cash flow model. The sign
ificant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from ou r long-range plan, capital spend
ing, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate.

Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition
We recognize sales r
evenue when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reportednet of consumer coupon redemp
tion, trade promotion and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts.Sales, use, value-added, and othe
r excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. Coupons are recorded when distributed, bas ed on estimated redemption rates. Tradepromotions are recorded 
based on estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. We generally do not allow a right ofreturn. However, on 
a limited case-by- case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned insaleable condition is r
esold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Terms and col lection patterns vary around theworld and by channel. The allowance 
for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, asdetermined based on a rev
iew of past due balances and other spec ific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem theamount is uncollectible.
Environmental
Environmental costs rel
ating to existing conditions caused by pas t operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilities foranticipated remed
iation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later th an the completion offeasibility studies or ou
r commitment to a plan of action.Advertising Production Costs
We expense the production cos
ts of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.Research and Development
All expenditures for 
research and developmen t (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new product andmanufacturing process innov
ation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies att ributable to R&Dactivities. Other costs i
nclude depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.Foreign Currency Translation
For all significant 
foreign operations, the fun ctional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the period-endexchange rates. Income stateme
nt accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are reflectedwithin accumulated othe
r comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings forthe period, except for 
gains and losses on investments in subs idiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains andlosses on instruments designat
ed as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.Derivative Instruments
All derivatives are 
recognized on our Consolidated Bal ance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value, and are recordedin either current or non
current assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded i n net earnings or othercomprehensive income, bas
ed on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losseson derivative instruments 
reported in AOCI are reclass ified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceasesto exist, any associated a
mounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is r ecognized in earnings in the current period.Stock-based Compensation
We generally measur
e compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units using the value of a share of our stock on the date of grant. We estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black
-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Our stock-basedcompensation expense is re
corded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consol idated Statements of Earnings andallocated to each r
eportable segment in our segment results.Certain 
equity-based compensation p lans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees anddirectors. We consider 
a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on prov iding subsequent service.Accordingly, the related
 compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from thegrant date to the date 
retirement eligibility is achieved,  if less than the stated vesting period.We report the benefi
ts of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as a financing cash f low, thereby reducing net operating cash flows andincreasing net financ
ing cash flows.
Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit PlansWe sponsor several domesti
c and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees. Under certaincircumstances, we also 
provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in 
57

Table of Contentsthe United States, Canada, and Mexi
co. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that donot vest or accumulate wi
th service (such as severan ce based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Ourpostemployment benefit p
lans are unfunded.We recognize the under
funded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.
Use of Estimates
Preparing our Consolidated Financi
al Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimatesand assumptions that affe
ct reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and thereported amounts of revenu
es and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible
 assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit andpostemployment benefit pla
ns. Actual results could differ from our estimates.Other New Accounting Standards
In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value, providing apractical expedien
t to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. We adopted the guidanceretrospectively and r
estated the fiscal 2016 fair value of plan asset tables in Note 13. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations orfinancial position.
In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which perm it reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with amonth-end to apply a pract
ical expedient that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity’s fiscal yea
r-end and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results ofoperations or financia
l position.In the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, requiring noncurrentclassification for all deferred tax
 assets and liabilities on the statement of financial position. This presentation change has been implemented retroactively. Theadoption of this guidance did not h
ave a material impact on our financial position.In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting requirements for the classification of debt issuance costs presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the ca
rrying amount of the debt liability. This presentation change has been implemented retroactively. The adoption of this guidance did not have amaterial impac
t on our financial position.In the second quarter of f
iscal 2015, we adopted new accounting requirements for share-based payment awards issued based upon specific performance targets. The adoption of this guidance did not h
ave a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2015, we adopted new accounting requir ements on the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a netoperating loss, a simila
r tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our results of operations or f inancialposition.
NOTE 3. ACQUISITI

Table of ContentsNOTE 4. RESTRUCTURI
NG, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTSWe view our restructurin
g activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of return and net present value targets. E
ach restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case ofmulti-year programs
), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. These ac tivities result in various restructuring costs, including assetwrite-offs, exit charges i
ncluding severance, contract termination fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructuredassets, as used in the context o
f our disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life orupdating the salvage value o
f depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset isrecognized immedia
tely in the period the plan is approved.We are 
currently pursuing severa l multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind our key growth strategies.Charges recorded in fisca

   Our annual goodwill intangible ass

 brand intangible assets and U.S. Yogurt reporting unit had risk of dec

refore, future sales and profitability projections in our long-range plan for this business declined. As a result of this triggeringevent, we performed an int

ed the carrying value of the asset. Significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated long-range cash flowprojections for the Green Gi

Table of ContentsRISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
As a part of our ongoing operations, we a
re exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity and equityprices. To manage these r
isks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established policies.COMMODITY PRICE RISK
Many commodities we use in the 
production and distribution of ou r products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for ourprincipal ingredients 
and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and dies el fuel. Our primaryobjective when entering in
to these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain.We manage our exposures through 
a combination of purchase o rders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counteroptions and swaps. We offset our exposur
es based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our p lannedcost as possible.
We use derivatives to m
anage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to a chieve hedge accounting forcommodity derivative pos
itions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statementsof Earnings.
Although we do not meet the crit
eria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providingcertainty in the futu
re price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performance thesegains and losses are report
ed in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings.At that time we reclass
ify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economiceffects of 
the derivative without e xperiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.Unallocated corporate items 
for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 included:

             As of May 28, 2017, the net notional value o
f commodity derivatives was $410.3 million, of which $289.6 million related to agricultural inputs and $120.7 millionrelated to energy inputs. Th
ese contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to inter
est rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primaryexposures include U.S. Treasury rat
es, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forwa rd-startinginterest rate swaps, and t
reasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desiredproportion of fixed rate v
ersus floating-rate debt, based on current and proj ected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty toexchange the difference bet
ween fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.Floating Interest Rate Exposur
es — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assesse
d based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on theunderlying debt. Effectiv
e gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into e arnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains and losses arerecorded as net inter
est. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in each of fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015.

Table of ContentsFixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed
-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assess ed based on changes in thefair value of the under
lying debt and derivatives, using incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Ineffective gainsand losses on these 
derivatives and the under lying hedged items are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a $4.3 million gain in fiscal2017, less than $1 million in fis
cal 2016, and a $1.6 million gain in fiscal 2015.In advance of planned debt f
inancing, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into $100 million and $400 million,respectively, of tre
asury locks due February 15, 2017 with an average fixed rate of 2.0 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $17.2 millionduring the third quarter o
f fiscal 2017, concurrent with the issuance of our $750.0 million 10-year fixed-rate notes. In fiscal 2015, we entered in
to swaps to convert $500.0 million of 1.4 percent fixed-rate notes due Octob er 20, 2017, and $500.0 million of 2.2 percent fixed-ratenotes due October 21, 2019, to floating 
rates.As of

EXCHANGE RISK Foreign currency fluctua
tions affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases, intercompany loans, product shipments, and for
eign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principalexposures are to the Austral
ian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chin ese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swissfranc. We primari
ly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign- denominated commerc
ial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity withforeign exchange exposure. The g
ains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation g ains or losses recorded in earnings on the associatedborrowings. We generally do not hedg
e more than 18 months in advance.As of 
May 28, 2017, the net notional value o f foreign exchange derivatives was $850.2 million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million ineach of fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015.
We also have many net inves
tments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing euro- denominated commerc
ial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 28, 2017, we hedged a portion of these net investments with €2,200 million ofeuro denominated bonds. As of May 28, 2017, we had def
erred net foreign currency trans action losses of $39.1 million in AOCI associated with net investmenthedging activity.
Venezuela is a highly infl
ationary economy and as such, we remeasur ed the value of the assets and liabilities of our former Venezuelan subsidiary based on theexchange rate at which we exp
ected to remit dividends in U.S. dollars from the SIMADI market. In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8 million foreign exchang e loss.In the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2016, we sold our General Mills de Venezuela CA subsidiary to a third party and exited our business in Venezuela.EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity price movements a
ffect our compensation expense as ce rtain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued. We useequity swaps to manage this risk. As of M
ay 28, 2017, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $138.9 million. These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2018.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTIN
GENT FEATURESCertain of our derivativ
e instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the major credit rating agencies. If our 
debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivativeinstruments in net liab
ility positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments wit h credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liabilityposition on May 28, 2017, was $1.0 million. We hav
e posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been tr
iggered on May 28, 2017, we would have been required to post $1.0 million of collateral to counterparties.

tions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. Thesetransactions may expose us to 
potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. We alsoenter into commodity fu
tures transactions through various regulated exchanges.The amount of loss due to the cr
edit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is $5.8 million against which we do not hold collat
eral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other security to support financialinstruments subject to th
reshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a trustaccount that we may acc
ess if the counterparty defaults.We 
offer certain suppliers access to third party services that allows them to view our scheduled payments online. The third party services also allow suppliers tofinance advances on our schedu

NOTE 9. REDEEMABLE AND NONC
ONTROLLING INTERESTSOur 
principal redeemable and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl, and General Mills Cereals, LLC(GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we hav
e four foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling $8.5 million as of May 28, 2017.We have a 51 percent cont
rolling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marqu es SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaininginterests in each of th
e entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 49 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable int
erest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once peryear, up to three times b
efore December 2024. We adjust the value of the redeemab le interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheetsquarterly to the rede
emable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends annually if it meets certain financial metrics set forth in its sharehold
ers agreement. As of May 28, 2017, the redemption value of the euro-denominated redeemable interest was $910.9 million.On the acquisition dates, we re
corded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and 50 percent Canadian dollar-denomina
ted interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait Marques SNC earns aroyalty stream through a 
licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to  Yoplait
  and related tradem arks. Liberté Marques Sàrl earns a royalty streamthrough licensing agreem
ents with certain Yoplait group companies for the rights to  Liberté
  and related trademarks. These enti ties pay dividends annually basedon their available cash as
 of their fiscal year end.

Table of ContentsWe paid dividends of $48.6 mill
ion in fiscal 2017, and $74.5 million in fiscal 2016, to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS and Yoplait Marques SNC shareholder agreements.
A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into 
an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodia al at market-determined prices throughJuly 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $186.4 m
illion for fiscal 2017 and $321.0 million for fiscal 2016.The holder of the GMC Class A Interests r
eceives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s c
apital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5 million). On June 1, 2015, the floatingpreferred return r
ate on GMC’s Class A interests was reset to the sum of thre e-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every threeyears through a negotiated 
agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.For financial reporting pu
rposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. T
he third-party investor’s share of the net earnings of these subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to redeemable andnoncontrolling interests 
in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.Our noncontrolling interests 
contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2017, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

       NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS
We 
use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 28, 2017, a total of 20.3 millionshares were available 
for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock un its, and shares of unrestricted stock under the 2011 StockCompensation Plan (2011 Plan) and the 2016 Compens
ation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2011 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based 
units, stock appreciation rights, and performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include some granted under the 2005, 2006, 2007and 2009 stock plans and the 2011 compensa
tion plan for non-employee directors, under which no further awards may be gran ted. The stock plans provide forpotential accele
rated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.

             We estimate the f
air value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock 
price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using thehistorical volatility over the
 expected term of the option, excluding time per iods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating ourstock price volatili
ty. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially thosewith tenors of greater th
an 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.Our 
expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises andemployee terminat
ions within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercis e behavior and therefore were aggregated into asingle pool for valuation purpos
es. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest rate forperiods during the 
expected term of the op tions is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant.Any corporate income tax ben
efit realized upon exercis e or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall taxbenefit) is presented 
in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow.Realized windfall tax ben
efits are credited to additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously r
ecognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to incometax expense, potentially 
resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated  a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits forthe purpose of accounting for 
future shortfall tax benefits.Options may be priced at 100 per
cent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date of grant. Options generally expire within 10 years and one mon
th after the date of grant.

Table of ContentsNOTE 13. RETIREMENT BENEF
ITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITSDefined Benefit Pension Plans
We have defined benefit 
pension plans covering many emp loyees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employeesare based on length of servi
ce and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service.Our funding policy is consistent with 
the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2017, 2016, and2015. We do not expect to be requi
red to make any contributions in f iscal 2018. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provisionthat any excess pension assets would b
e allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. All sala ried employeeshired on or after June 1, 2013 ar
e eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan.In May 2017, we announced changes to the Unit
ed States pension plans. The Company will freeze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefitsfor active employees who pa
rticipate in the United States pension plans as of December 31, 2027. Beginning January 1, 2028, active employees in the United Stateswill not accrue addition
al benefits for future service and eligible compensation received und er these plans. These changes resulted in a $130.9 million decline in theprojected benefit obl
igation as of May 28, 2017, due to the decrease in expected future pensionable compensation.Other Postretirement Bene
fit PlansWe also sponsor plans 
that provide health ca re benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States salaried health carebenefit plan is contribu
tory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain emplo yees and retirees on anannual basis. We made volunt
ary contributions to these plans of $20.0 million in in fiscal 2017 and $24.0 million in fiscal 2016.Health Care Cost Trend Rates
Assumed health care cost 
trends are as follows:  
 
  Fiscal Year    
  2017    2016  Health care cost trend 
rate for next year   7.0% and 7.3%    7.3% and 7.5% Rate to which the cost trend r
ate is assumed to decline (ultimate rate)   5.0%     5.0%  Year that the rate reaches the
 ultimate trend rate   2024        2024       
        We review our health ca
re cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and inform ation provided byour actuaries. This infor
mation includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similarorganizations. Our i
nitial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as nec essary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations.Our initial health ca
re cost trend rate assumption is 7.3 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 7.0 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fisca l 2017. Ratesare graded down annually until 
the ultimate trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2024 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if theretirees’ benefits increase as a 
result of health care inflation . The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic viewon the rate of long-ter
m inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an importa nt effect on the amountsreported for the other p
ostretirement benefit plans.A one percentage point change 
in the health care cost trend rate would have th e following effects:

Table of ContentsPostemployment Benefit Plans
Under certain circums
tances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obliga
tion for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service(such as severance based sol
ely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurr ed. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.In the first quarter o
f fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which perm it reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with amonth-end to apply a pract
ical expedient to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity’s fiscal year-end and apply such practical 
expedient consistently to all plans. We measured the plan assets and obligations for our defined benefit pension, other postretirementbenefit, and postemploymen
t benefit plans as of May 31, 2017. Summarized financial information

Beginning in fiscal 2017, we adopted th e full yield curve method.Discount Rates
Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed th
e method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our internation
al defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach toestimate service 
cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used t o determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projectedcash flows. This method provides a mo
re precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to thecorresponding rate on the yi
eld curve. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yieldcurve used to measure the b
enefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect th e measurement of our benefit obligations related to theseplans. We have accounted fo
r this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The change in methodologyresulted in a decreas
e in service and interest cost of approximately $68 million for fiscal 2017 compared to our previous methodology. The fiscal 2017 reduction inour net periodic benefi
t expense as a result of this change in methodology was partially offset by a reduction in our weighted-average expected rate of return onplan assets for our princip
al defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 8.25 percent as a result of changes that decreasedinvestment risk in the por
tfolio.Beginning in fiscal 2017, our discount 
rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other  postretirement benefit, andpostemployment benefit p
lan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May 31 to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, andpostemployment benefit p
lan income and expense for the following fis cal year. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expectedfuture cash outflows to plan pa
rticipants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to thatindex based on our credit risk. Th
is forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

Table of ContentsExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate of retur
n on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using 
input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review thisassumption annually for ea
ch plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year do es not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.Weighted-average ass
et allocations for the past two fiscal years for our defined benefit pension and o ther postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

The investment objectiv
e for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to particip ants at a reasonablecost to us. Our goal is to optimiz
e the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefitplan portfolios are broad
ly diversified across asse t classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investmentorganizations. For the defin
ed benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is: 20 percent to equities in the United Stat es; 15 percent tointernational equities; 10 
percent to private equities; 40 percent to fixed income; and 15 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). For otherpostretirement bene
fit plans, the long-term investment policy allo cations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 15 percent to international equities; 10percent to private equities; 
40 percent to fixed income; and 5 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes mayvary tactically a
round the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.Contributions and Future Benefit Payments
We do not 
expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans in fiscal2018. Actual fiscal 2018 contribu
tions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake disc retionary funding of our benefit trustsand future changes in
 regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid fromfiscal 2018 to 2027 as

We have established a val
uation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described above as current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of
 the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary income versus capital gain income) within the carryforward period to allow us torealize these deferred tax benefits.
Of the total valuation a
llowance of $231.8 million, the majority relates to a deferred tax asset for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury acquisition in the amount of $167.2 million, $53.3 million r
elates to various state and foreign loss carryforwards, and $11.1 million relates to various foreign capital loss carryforwards. As ofMay 28, 2017, we believe it is more
-likely-than-not that the remainder of our deferred tax  assets are realizable.We have $142.1 million of tax 
loss carryforwards. Of this amount, $125.3 million is foreign loss carryforwards. The carry forward periods are as follows: $93.2million do not expire; $3.7 m
illion expire in fiscal 2018 and 2019; and $28.4 million expire in fiscal 2020 and beyond. The remaining $16.8 million are stateoperating loss carryforwa
rds, the majority of which expi re after fiscal 2023.We have not recognized a
 deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our foreign operat ions because our subsidiaries haveinvested or will invest the und
istributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is not practicable for us to determinethe amount of 
unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operationswhen we determine that such e
arnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. In fiscal 2015, we approved a one-time rep atriation of $606.1 million of historicalforeign earnings to reduc
e the economic cost of funding restructuring initiatives and the acquisition of Annie’s. We recorded a discrete tax charge of $78.6 millionin fiscal 2015 
related to this act ion. We have previously asserted that our historical foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and will only be repatriated in atax-neutral manner, 
and this one-time repatriation does not change this on-going assertion.We are subject to fed
eral income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before anuncertain tax position is 
audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertaintax position, we 
believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjus t these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light ofchanging facts and circu
mstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash.
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdic tions include the United States (federal and state) andCanada. Various tax examinat
ions by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generallyfrom 
3 to 5 years.  
89

Table of ContentsSeveral state and fore
ign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our re sults of operations orfinancial position.
During fiscal 2017, the Intern
al Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of our fede ral tax returns for fiscal 2013 and 2014. The audit closure andrelated adjustments d
id not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. As of May 28, 2017, we have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2014 and p
rior.During fiscal 2017, the Brazil
ian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits of our 2012 and 2013 tax return years. These auditsincluded a review of our det
erminations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. (Yoki). The RFB has proposedadjustments that 
effectively eliminate the good will amortization benefits related to this transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to contestthe disallowance.
We apply a more-like
ly-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 
percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution ofuncertain tax positions wil
l affect earnings in the period of such change.The following table sets for
th changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.Approximately $62 million of 
this total in fiscal 2017 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods. Thisamount differs from th
e gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because certain of the liabilities  below would impact deferred taxes if recognized.We also would record a decr
ease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

        As of May 28, 2017, we expect to pay approxima

mate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. The remaining amount of ourunrecognized tax liabi
lity was classified in other liabilities. We report accrued in
terest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For fiscal 2017, we recognized a n et benefit of $5.6million of tax-rel
ated net interest and penalties, and had $23.1 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 28, 2017. For fiscal 2016, we recognized a netbenefit of $2.7 million of 
tax-related net in terest and penalties, and had $32.1 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 29, 2016.NOTE 15. LEASES, OTHER 
COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCIES The Company’s leases are gene
rally for warehouse space and equipment. Rent expense under all operating leases from continuing operations was $188.1 million infiscal 2017, $189.1 million in f
iscal 2016, and $193.5 million in fiscal 2015.Some operating leases 
require payment of prope rty taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and escalation rent inexcess of minimum rent p
ayments and sublease income netted in rent expense were insignificant.
