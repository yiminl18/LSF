an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed in accordance with US GAAP as in effect from time to time; provided that if
Parent, by notice to the Administrative Agent, shall request an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring
after the date hereof in US GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders, by notice to Parent, shall request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is
given before or after such change in US GAAP or in the application thereof, then (i) such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of US GAAP
as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such
provision amended in accordance herewith and (ii) Parent shall provide such statements of reconciliation as are reasonably necessary to enable
calculations of any ratio or amount set forth herein on the basis of US GAAP as in effect and applied before such change shall have become
effective. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and
all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to (i) any election under Accounting Standards
Codification 825-10-25 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to
value any Financial Indebtedness or other liabilities of Parent or any Subsidiary at “fair value” as defined therein, (ii) any treatment of Financial
Indebtedness under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20 or 2015-03 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial
Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any such Financial Indebtedness in a reduced or bifurcated manner as described
therein, and such Financial Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal amount thereof, and (iii) any treatment of any lease
(or similar arrangement conveying the right to use) as a Finance Lease where such lease (or similar arrangement) would not have been required
to be so treated under US GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2017, as a result of the effectiveness of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification 842 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification having a similar result or effect) (and related
interpretations).
 
(b)            All computations in respect of EBITDA for any period required to be made hereunder giving pro forma effect to any
Material Acquisition or Material Disposition shall be calculated as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of such period as follows:
(i) historical revenues and other historical income statement items (whether positive or negative) directly attributable to the property or Person
subject to such Material Acquisition or Material Disposition (x) in the case of a Material Acquisition, shall be included (but without giving effect
to any cost savings or synergies) and (y) in the case of a Material Disposition, shall be excluded and (ii) any retirement of Financial Indebtedness
and any Financial Indebtedness incurred or assumed by Parent or any of the Subsidiaries in connection therewith shall be given pro forma effect
as if the same had occurred on the first day of such period (and if any such Financial Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being
given pro forma effect, the interest on such Financial Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been
the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedge Agreement applicable to such indebtedness if such Hedge Agreement has
a remaining term in excess of 12 months)).
 
SECTION 1.06.     Currency Translation. The Administrative Agent shall determine the US Dollar Equivalent of any
Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency on each applicable Exchange Rate Date, in each case using the Exchange Rate for such
Alternative Currency in relation to US Dollars in effect on the date of determination, and such amount shall be the US Dollar Equivalent of such
Borrowing until the next required calculation thereof pursuant to this sentence. The Administrative Agent shall notify Parent and the Lenders of
each determination of the US Dollar Equivalent of each Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency.

36
 
SECTION 1.08.     Interest Rate; Benchmark Notification. The interest rate on any Loan denominated in US Dollars or an
Alternative Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Upon
the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 2.11(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The
Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration,
submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor
rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including, without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative,
successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing rate being
replaced, or have the same volume or liquidity as any existing interest rate, prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent
and its Affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this Agreement or
any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a
manner adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain
any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrowers, any Lender or any other Person for damages of any kind, including direct or
indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at
law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.
 
SECTION 1.09.     Most Favored Nation Provision.
 
(a)            In the event that the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement shall contain any financial covenant, any restrictive
covenant, any event of default, any subsidiary guarantee or any collateral requirement (each, an “MFN Provision”) that is either not set forth in
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or is more restrictive on Parent and the Subsidiaries or otherwise more favorable to the lenders or
other creditors thereunder than the corresponding provisions set forth in this Agreement or such other Loan Document, then this Agreement or
such other Loan Document, as applicable, shall automatically be deemed to have been amended to incorporate such MFN Provision,
mutatis mutandis, as if set forth fully herein or therein, without any further action required on the part of any Person, effective as of the date when
such MFN Provision became effective under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. Parent shall execute any and all further documents and
agreements, including amendments hereto, and shall take all such further actions, as shall be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to
give effect to this paragraph. Failure by Parent or any Subsidiary to observe or perform any provision incorporated pursuant to this Section shall
constitute an Event of Default under clause (d) of Article VII, provided that the period of grace (if any) applicable to the failure to observe or
perform the MFN Provision set forth in the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement shall also apply hereunder.
 
(b)            If, after the time this Agreement is amended pursuant to Section 1.09(a) to include in this Agreement any MFN
Provision (an “Incorporated MFN Provision”) contained in the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, such Incorporated MFN Provision ceases
to be in effect under, or is deleted from, the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (including as a result of the termination of the Five-Year
Revolving Credit Agreement upon the repayment in full of all Financial Indebtedness outstanding thereunder and the termination of all
commitments thereunder), or is amended or modified for the purposes of the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement so as to become less
restrictive with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, then, upon the request of Parent, the Required Lenders will amend this Agreement to
delete or similarly amend or modify, as the case may be, such Incorporated MFN Provision as in effect in this Agreement, provided that no
Default or Event of Default shall be in existence immediately before or after such deletion, amendment or modification. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this Section 1.09(b) as the result of any Incorporated MFN Provision ceasing to be in
effect or being deleted, amended or otherwise modified shall cause any financial covenant, any restrictive covenant, any event of default, any
subsidiary guarantee or any collateral requirement in this Agreement to be less restrictive as to Parent or any Subsidiary than such financial
covenant, restrictive covenant, event of default, subsidiary guarantee or collateral requirement as contained in this Agreement as in effect on the
Effective Date, and as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified thereafter (other than as the result of the application of Section 1.09(a)).
 
 
37
 
SECTION 1.10.     Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division
under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws) (each, a “Division”): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or
liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from
the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been
organized and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.
 
SECTION 1.11.     Blocking Regulations. In relation to any Lender that is incorporated in Germany or otherwise is subject to
the regulations referred to below (each, a “Restricted Lender”), any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein that refers to Sanctions
and/or a Sanctioned Person (each, a “Specified Provision”) shall only apply for the benefit of such Restricted Lender to the extent that such
Specified Provision would not result in (a) a violation of, conflict with or liability under EU Regulation (EC) 2271/96 (or any implementing law
or regulation in any member state of the European Union or any similar applicable blocking or anti-boycott law or regulation in the UK) or (b) a
violation of or conflict with section 7 foreign trade rules (AWV) (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) (in connection with section 4 paragraph 1 no. 3
foreign trade law (AWG) (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz)) or a similar anti-boycott statute (the “Mandatory Restrictions”). In the case of any consent or
direction by Lenders in respect of any Specified Provision of which a Restricted Lender does not have the benefit due to a Mandatory Restriction,
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the definition of Required Lenders, for so long as such Restricted Lender shall be subject to a
Mandatory Restriction, the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Restricted Lender will be disregarded for the purpose of
determining whether the requisite consent of the Lenders has been obtained or direction by the requisite Lenders has been made, it being agreed,
however, that, unless, in connection with any such determination, the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from any Lender
stating that such Lender is a Restricted Lender with respect thereto, each Lender shall be presumed, in connection with such determination, not to
be a Restricted Lender.
 
ARTICLE II
 
The Credits
 
SECTION 2.01.     Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Loans
denominated in US Dollars or any Alternative Currency to each Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate
principal amount for all such Loans that will not result in (a) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding the Aggregate Commitment or
(b) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender exceeding its Commitment. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Loans.
 
SECTION 2.02.     Loans and Borrowings. (a)  Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the
same Type and currency made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments to the same Borrower. The failure of any
Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the
Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required.
 
 
38
 
(b)            Subject to Section 2.11, (i) each Borrowing denominated in US Dollars shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans,
Daily Simple SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) may request in accordance herewith,
(ii) each Borrowing denominated in Sterling shall be comprised entirely of Daily Simple SONIA Loans and (iii) each Borrowing denominated in
Euros shall be comprised entirely of EURIBOR Loans. Each Lender at its option may make any Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch
or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the applicable
Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(c)            At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Term Benchmark Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum; provided that (i) any Term
Benchmark Borrowing that results from a continuation of an outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is
equal to such outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing and (ii) a Term Benchmark Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the
entire unused balance of the total Commitments. At the time each ABR Borrowing or any RFR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in
an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum; provided that an ABR
Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments. Borrowings
of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 10 (or such greater
number as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent) Term Benchmark Borrowings and RFR Borrowings outstanding.
 
(d)            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrowers shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to
convert to or continue, any Term Benchmark Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.
 
SECTION 2.03.     Requests for Borrowings. To request a Borrowing, the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) shall
notify the Applicable Agent (a) in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days
before the date of the proposed Borrowing, (b) in the case of an RFR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three RFR
Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (c) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such request shall be made by delivery to the Applicable Agent of a written Borrowing Request
executed by a Financial Officer of the applicable Borrower (or, if applicable, of Parent). Each Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i)            the Borrower requesting such Borrowing (or on whose behalf Parent is requesting such Borrowing);
 
(ii)           the currency and the principal amount of such Borrowing;
 
(iii)          the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iv)            the Type of such Borrowing;
 
(v)                in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a
period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”; and
 
 
39
 
(vi)            the location and number of the account of the applicable Borrower to which funds are to be disbursed, and
identifying information with respect to the applicable recipient bank (and any correspondent bank, if applicable) (which shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Applicable Agent).
 
If no currency is specified with respect to any requested Borrowing, then the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) shall be deemed to
have selected US Dollars. If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be (A) in the case of a
Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, an ABR Borrowing, (B) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Euro, a EURIBOR Borrowing and
(C) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Sterling, a Daily Simple SONIA Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any
requested Term Benchmark Borrowing, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s
duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender of
the requested Borrowing of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
 
SECTION 2.04.     Funding of Borrowings. (a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed
date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 1:30 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of ABR
Loans, such later time as shall be two hours after the delivery by or on behalf of the applicable Borrower of a Borrowing Request therefor in
accordance with Section 2.03), to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.
The Applicable Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so received, in like funds,
to the account designated in the applicable Borrowing Request.
 
(b)            Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing
that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that
such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance on such
assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made
available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such
Lender, (A) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of (x) the NYFRB Rate and (y) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, the greater of (x) the rate reasonably
determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) and (y) a
rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a payment to be made
by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan pursuant to Section 2.10. If any Borrower and such Lender shall pay such
interest to the Applicable Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Applicable Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount
of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Borrower
shall not be required to pay such amount to the Applicable Agent and such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such
Borrowing. Any payment by any Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have
failed to make such payment to the Applicable Agent.
 
 
40
 
SECTION 2.05.     Interest Elections. (a)  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and, in the case of a Term Benchmark
Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03.
Thereafter, the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) may elect to convert such Borrowing (if denominated in US Dollars) to a Borrowing
of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as
provided in this Section. A Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) may elect different options with respect to different portions of an affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing and the
Loans resulting from an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section, no Borrower shall be permitted to change the currency of any Borrowing, to elect a Type for any Borrowing not
available under Section 2.02(b) for the currency in which such Borrowing is denominated or to elect an Interest Period for a Term Benchmark
Borrowing that does not comply with Section 2.02(d).
 
(b)            To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) shall notify the
Applicable Agent of such election by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting
a Borrowing of the Type and in the currency resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such election
shall be made by delivery to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request executed by a Financial Officer of the applicable
Borrower (or, if applicable, of Parent). Each Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify the following information in
compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i)            the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect
to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be
specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
 
(ii)            the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)            the Type of the resulting Borrowing; and
 
(iv)            if the resulting Borrowing is to be a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable
Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
 
(c)            Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request in accordance with this Section, the Applicable Agent
shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
(d)            If the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a
Term Benchmark Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein,
at the end of such Interest Period, (i) in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted
to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Euro, such Borrowing shall be continued as a Term
Benchmark Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month.
 
(e)            Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has
occurred and is continuing with respect to any Borrower, or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative
Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, has notified Parent of the election to give effect to this sentence on account of such other Event of
Default, then, in each such case, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Borrowing denominated in US Dollars may be
converted to or continued as a Term SOFR Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Term SOFR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing
at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in an Alternate
Currency shall be continued as a Borrowing of the applicable Type with an Interest Period of one month’s duration.

SECTION 2.06.     Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Increase of Commitments. (a)  Unless previously terminated,
the Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.
 
(b)            Parent may at any time terminate, or from time to time permanently reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 and not less than US$5,000,000 and (ii) Parent
shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.08,
the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitment.
 
(c)            Parent shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under
paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days (or such shorter period as may be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent)
prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice,
the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by Parent pursuant to this Section shall be
irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section may state that such notice
is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by Parent (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Commitments.
 
 
42
 
(d)            Parent may at any time and from time to time by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly
upon receipt deliver a copy thereof to each of the Lenders) executed by Parent and one or more financial institutions (any such financial
institution being referred to as an “Increasing Lender”), which may include any Lender, cause Commitments of the Increasing Lenders to be
increased (or cause the Increasing Lenders to extend new Commitments) in an amount for each Increasing Lender (which shall not be less than
US$5,000,000) set forth in such notice; provided that (i) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment pursuant to this
paragraph, (ii) after giving effect to any increase in the Commitments pursuant to this paragraph (a “Commitment Increase”), the aggregate
amount of all Commitment Increases established pursuant to this paragraph shall not be greater than US$500,000,000, (iii) each Increasing
Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (iv) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall become a party to this Agreement by
completing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a duly executed accession agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and Parent (an “Accession Agreement”). Upon the effectiveness of any Accession Agreement to which any Increasing
Lender is a party (and the effectiveness of the new Commitment of such Lender in accordance with this paragraph), such Increasing Lender shall
thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded a Lender hereunder and
subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder. Each Commitment Increase shall become effective on the date specified in the applicable notice
delivered pursuant to this paragraph (which date shall be at least five Business Days (or such shorter period as may be reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent) after the date of delivery of such notice); provided that no Commitment Increase shall become effective unless (A) the
Administrative Agent shall have received, with respect to such Commitment Increase, such opinions, documents and certificates consistent with
those delivered under Sections 4.01(b) and 4.01(c) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, (B) on the effective date of such
Commitment Increase, the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct (x) in the
case of the representations and warranties qualified as to materiality, in all respects and (y) otherwise, in all material respects, in each case on and
as of the date of such effectiveness, except in the case of any such representation and warranty that expressly relates to a prior date, in which case
such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct on and as of such prior date (provided that (I) in the case of the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.05(b) and 3.08(a), each reference therein to the Effective Date shall be deemed to be a reference to the effective
date of such Commitment Increase and (II) in the case of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.05(b), the reference therein to
June 30, 2021 shall be deemed to be a reference to the date of Parent’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements most recently delivered to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.01(a)), (C) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (D) the Administrative Agent shall
have received a certificate dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of Parent to the effect that the conditions set forth in
clauses (B) and (C) above shall have been satisfied. The Administrative Agent shall notify Parent and the Lenders of the effective date of each
Commitment Increase (the “Increase Effective Date”), and such notice shall be conclusive and binding. On the Increase Effective Date of any
Commitment Increase, (i) the aggregate principal amount of any Loans outstanding (the “Existing Borrowings”) immediately prior to such
Commitment Increase on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be repaid, (ii) each Increasing Lender that shall have had a Commitment
prior to such Commitment Increase shall pay to the Applicable Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds in each applicable currency
an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such
Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of each Subsequent Borrowing (as hereinafter defined) and (B) the product of (1) such
Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of each Existing
Borrowing, (iii) each Increasing Lender that shall not have had a Commitment prior to such Commitment Increase shall pay to the Applicable
Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds in each applicable currency an amount equal to the product of (1) such Increasing Lender’s
Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of each Subsequent Borrowing,
(iv) after the Applicable Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, the Applicable Agent shall remit (in the applicable
currency) to each Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference (if positive) between (A) the product of (1) such Lender’s
Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of each Existing Borrowing,
and (B) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the
amount of each Subsequent Borrowing, (v) after the effectiveness of such Commitment Increase, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have made
new Borrowings (the “Subsequent Borrowings”) in amounts and currencies equal to the amounts and currencies of the Existing Borrowings and
of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Applicable Agent in accordance with Section 2.03,
(vi) each Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (calculated after giving effect to such
Commitment Increase) and (vii) the Borrowers shall pay each Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on its Loans comprising the
Existing Borrowings. To the extent the Existing Borrowings include any Term Benchmark Borrowings, the deemed payments of such Existing
Borrowings made pursuant to clause (i) above shall be subject to compensation by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.13 if the
Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period(s) relating thereto.
 
 
43
 
SECTION 2.07.     Repayment of Loans; Extension of Maturity Date; Evidence of Debt. (a)  Each Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay to the Applicable Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by
such Lender to such Borrower on the Maturity Date (in the case of any Declining Lender, without giving effect to the extension thereof pursuant
to Section 2.07(b)).
 
(b)            Parent may, by delivery of a Maturity Date Extension Request to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly
upon receipt deliver a copy thereof to each of the Lenders), request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional period of one
year; provided that (i) Parent shall provide no more than one Maturity Date Extension Request in any 12-month period and (ii) there shall be no
more than two extensions of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section; provided further that no extension may result in the Maturity Date as so
extended being more than three years after the date of effectiveness of such extension. Each Lender shall, by notice to Parent and the
Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day after the date of the Administrative Agent’s receipt of the Maturity Date Extension
Request from Parent, advise Parent whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Lender agreeing to a requested extension being
called a “Consenting Lender”, and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a “Declining Lender”). Any Lender that
has not so advised Parent and the Administrative Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a
Declining Lender. If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have agreed to a Maturity Date Extension Request, then the Maturity Date
shall, as to the Consenting Lenders, be extended to the first anniversary of the Maturity Date theretofore in effect. The decision to agree or
withhold agreement to any Maturity Date Extension Request shall be at the sole discretion of each Lender. The Commitment of any Declining
Lender shall terminate on the Maturity Date in effect prior to giving effect to any such extension (such Maturity Date being called the “Existing
Maturity Date”). The principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Declining Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon and any
accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing
Maturity Date, and on the Existing Maturity Date the Borrowers shall also make such other prepayments of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.08 as
shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, Declining Lenders pursuant to
this sentence, (x) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the Aggregate Commitment and (y) the Revolving Credit Exposure
of any Lender would not exceed its Commitment. Parent shall have the right, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.16(b), at any time
prior to the Existing Maturity Date, to replace a Declining Lender with a Lender or other Eligible Assignee that will agree to the applicable
Maturity Date Extension Request, and any such replacement Lender shall for all purposes constitute a Consenting Lender. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless (i) the Administrative Agent shall have
received, with respect to such extension, such opinions, documents and certificates consistent with those delivered under Sections 4.01(b) and
4.01(c) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, (ii) on the date of effectiveness of such extension, the representations and warranties
of the Loan Parties set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct (x) in the case of the representations and warranties qualified as to
materiality, in all respects and (y) otherwise, in all material respects, in each case on and as of such date, except in the case of any such
representation and warranty that expressly relates to a prior date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct on
and as of such prior date (provided that (I) in the case of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.05(b) and 3.08(a), each
reference therein to the Effective Date shall be deemed to be a reference to the date of effectiveness of such extension and (II) in the case of the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.05(b), the reference therein to June 30, 2021 shall be deemed to be a reference to the date of
Parent’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements most recently delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.01(a)), (iii) on the
date of effectiveness of such extension, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall have received a
certificate dated the date of effectiveness of such extension and executed by a Financial Officer of Parent to the effect that the conditions set forth
in clauses (ii) and (iii) above shall have been satisfied.
 
 
44
 
(c)            Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness
of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal, interest and fees payable
and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(d)            The records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be prima facie evidence of the existence
and amounts of the obligations of the Borrowers in respect of the Loans and interest and fees due or accrued hereunder; provided that the failure
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
Borrowers to pay any amounts due hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(e)            Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, each Borrower
shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and
its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest
thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form
payable to the payee named therein (or, if requested by such payee, to such payee and its registered assigns).
 
SECTION 2.08.     Prepayment of Loans. (a)  The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay
any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section.
 
(b)            If, on any date, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed the Aggregate Commitment, then the
applicable Borrowers shall, (i) if any ABR Borrowing or RFR Borrowing is then outstanding, not later than the next Business Day following
receipt of notice of such excess from the Administrative Agent, prepay Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount
necessary to eliminate such excess (after giving effect to any other prepayment of Borrowings on such day) and (B) the amount of such ABR
Borrowings or RFR Borrowings and (ii) if no ABR Borrowing or RFR Borrowing is then outstanding or such excess is not eliminated after
giving effect to any prepayment of Borrowings made pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), on the last day of each successive Interest Period for
any Term Benchmark Borrowing occurring after receipt of notice of such excess from the Administrative Agent, prepay Borrowings in an
aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount necessary to eliminate such excess (after giving effect to any other prepayment of
Borrowings on such day) and (2) the amount of the applicable Term Benchmark Borrowing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on any date the
Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed 105% of the Aggregate Commitment, then the Borrowers shall, not later than the next
Business Day following receipt of notice of such excess from the Administrative Agent to Parent, prepay one or more Borrowings in an
aggregate amount equal to the amount necessary to eliminate such excess.
 
(c)            Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the Borrowers shall select the Borrowing
or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section.
 
(d)            The applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent by telephone (confirmed in writing promptly thereafter)
of any optional prepayment and any mandatory prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon,
New York City time, three Business Days before the date of such prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) of this Section,
as soon thereafter as practicable), (ii) in the case of prepayment of an RFR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three RFR
Business Days before the date of prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) of this Section, as soon thereafter as
practicable) and (iii) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such prepayment (which
shall be a Business Day). Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each
Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that a notice of prepayment of any Borrowing under paragraph (a) of this Section may state
that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by Parent
(by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified date of prepayment) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following
receipt of any such notice, the Applicable Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall
be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by
accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.10.
 
 
45
 
SECTION 2.09.     Fees. (a)  Parent agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, in US Dollars, for the account of each Lender a
commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily Unused Commitment of such Lender during the period from and
including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Commitment fees accrued through and including the
last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the 15th day following such last day, commencing
on the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and in the event of the termination in whole of the Commitment of any Lender, on the date of
such termination. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
 
(b)            Parent agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times
separately agreed upon between Parent and the Administrative Agent.
 
(c)            All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative
Agent for distribution, in the case of commitment fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
 
SECTION 2.10.     Interest. (a)  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus
the Applicable Rate.
 
(b)            The Loans comprising each Term SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR for the Interest
Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(c)            The Loans comprising each EURIBOR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted EURIBO Rate for the Interest
Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(d)            The Loans comprising each RFR Borrowing shall bear interest at the applicable Daily Simple RFR plus the
Applicable Rate.
 
(e)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any
Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest,
after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of or interest on any Loan, 2% per annum plus
the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% per
annum plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
 
 
46
 
(f)            Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon
termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in
the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period),
accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be
payable on the effective date of such conversion. All interest shall be payable in the currency in which the applicable Loan is denominated.
 
(g)            All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate and (ii) interest on Loans denominated in
Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number
of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Adjusted Term SOFR, Adjusted EURIBO Rate, the Daily
Simple RFR and Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Applicable Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.
 
SECTION 2.11.     Alternate Rate of Interest. (a)  Subject to Section 2.11(b), if:
 
(i)            the Applicable Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error)
(A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR, the Term SOFR, the Adjusted EURIBO Rate or the EURIBO Rate, as the case may be
(including because the Relevant Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for Loans denominated in the applicable
currency for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable
Daily Simple RFR or RFR for the applicable currency; or
 
(ii)            the Applicable Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a
Term Benchmark Borrowing, that the Adjusted Term SOFR or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for Loans denominated
in the applicable currency and for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
maintaining the Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, that the applicable Daily Simple RFR will
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining Loans included in such Borrowing;
 
then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof (which may be by telephone) to Parent and the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter
and, until (x) the Applicable Agent notifies Parent and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect
to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with
Section 2.05 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with Section 2.03, (A) in the case of Loans denominated in US Dollars, any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an
RFR Borrowing, as applicable, and any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing, as applicable,
shall instead be deemed to be an Interest Election Request or a Borrowing Request, as applicable, for (1) an RFR Borrowing denominated in US
Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of Section 2.11(a)(i) or 2.11(a)(ii) or (2) an ABR Borrowing if the
Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is also the subject of Section 2.11(a)(i) or 2.11(a)(ii) and (B) in the case of Loans denominated in an Alternative
Currency, any Interest Election Request that requests the continuation of any Borrowing as a Term Benchmark Borrowing and any Borrowing
Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing, in each case, for the relevant Benchmark, shall be ineffective (and no
Lender shall be obligated to make a Loan on account thereof). Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Agreed Currency
is outstanding on the date of Parent’s receipt of the notice from the Applicable Agent referred to in this Section 2.11(a) with respect to a Relevant
Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Applicable Agent notifies Parent and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its
behalf) delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with Section 2.05 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with Section 2.03,
(A) in the case of Loans denominated in US Dollars, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such
Loan, convert to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Loan denominated in US Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the
subject of Section 2.11(a)(i) or 2.11(a)(ii) or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is also the subject of Section 2.11(a)(i) or
2.11(a)(ii) and (2) any RFR Loan shall, on such date, convert to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan and (B) in the case of Loans denominated in
an Alternative Currency, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, convert to, and shall
constitute, a CBR Loan that bears interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that if the
Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the
applicable currency cannot be determined, any such affected Loan shall be prepaid in full by the applicable Borrower on the day that Parent
receives notice thereof from the Applicable Agent, and (2) any RFR Loan shall convert to, and shall constitute, a CBR Loan that bears interest at
the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that if the Applicable Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency cannot be determined, any such
affected Loan shall be prepaid in full by the applicable Borrower on the day that Parent receives notice thereof from the Applicable Agent.
 
 
47
 
(b)            (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event
and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark,
then such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any
Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is
provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document so long as no Agent has received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising
the Required Lenders.
 
(ii)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent, in
consultation with Parent, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark
Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document.
 
(iii)            The Administrative Agent will promptly notify Parent and the Lenders of (A) any occurrence of a Benchmark
Transition Event, (B) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement
Conforming Changes, (D) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(iv) and (E) the
commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by
any Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.11, including any determination with respect to
a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain
from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole
discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly
required pursuant to this Section 2.11.
 
(iv)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in
connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term
SOFR or the EURIBO Rate) and either (x) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that
publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (y) the regulatory
supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any
tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest
Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that
was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (x) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark
(including a Benchmark Replacement) or (y) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be
representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of
“Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
 
 
48
 
(v)            Upon Parent’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the applicable
Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) may revoke any request for borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of a Term Benchmark
Borrowing or RFR Borrowing, as applicable, to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period, and,
failing that, the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) will be deemed to have converted any request for (A) a Term Benchmark
Borrowing denominated in US Dollars into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to (1) an RFR Borrowing denominated in US
Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (2) an ABR Borrowing if the
Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in an
Alternative Currency or any RFR Borrowing shall be ineffective. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, as
applicable, that is outstanding on the date of Parent’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with
respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement for the applicable currency is
implemented pursuant to this Section 2.11(b), (A) in the case of Loans denominated in US Dollars, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall,
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, convert to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Loan denominated in US
Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) an ABR Loan if the
Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event and (2) any RFR Loan shall, on such date, convert to, and
shall constitute, an ABR Loan and (B) in the case of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan
shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, convert to, and shall constitute, a CBR Loan that bears interest at the
Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that if the Applicable Agent determines (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency cannot be
determined, any such affected Loan shall be prepaid in full by the applicable Borrower on the day that Parent receives notice thereof
from the Applicable Agent, and (2) any RFR Loan shall convert to, and shall constitute, a CBR Loan that bears interest at the Central
Bank Rate for the applicable currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that if the Applicable Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency cannot be determined, any
such affected Loan shall be prepaid in full by the applicable Borrower on the day that Parent receives notice thereof from the Applicable
Agent. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available
Tenor, the component of Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable,
will not be used in any determination of Alternate Base Rate and such component shall be deemed to be zero.
 
SECTION 2.12.     Increased Costs. (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)            impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted EURIBO Rate);
 
(ii)            impose on any Lender or any applicable offshore interbank market for the applicable currency any other condition,
cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans; or
 
 
49
 
(iii)            subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through
(e) of the definition of “Excluded Taxes” and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments
or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or
maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender or other
Recipient (subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section), Parent will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs or expenses
incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)            If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has had the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s
capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of or the Loans made by
such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then,
from time to time upon request of such Lender (subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section), Parent will pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)            A certificate of a Lender or other Recipient setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender or its holding company or such other Recipient, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, including in
reasonable detail a description of the basis for such claim for compensation and an explanation of how such amount or amounts were determined,
shall be delivered to Parent and shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided that no Lender shall deliver such certificate, and seek
compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, unless such Lender is generally seeking, or intends generally to seek, compensation from
similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such Lender has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so)
with respect to the applicable Change in Law; provided further that such Lender shall not be required to provide on such certificate (i) any
information that would cause such Lender to breach any obligation of confidentiality to any Person or violate any regulatory or internal policy
restrictions or (ii) any confidential or commercially sensitive information relating to such Lender's organizational affairs or financing strategies.
Parent shall pay to such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after
receipt thereof.
 
(d)            Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that Parent shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section for any increased costs or expenses incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that
such Lender notifies Parent of the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions and of such
Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased
costs or expenses or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof.
 
SECTION 2.13.     Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment by any Borrower of any principal of any Term
Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the
conversion or continuation of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure by any
Borrower to borrow (other than as a result of the failure of any Lender to fund a Loan required to be funded by it hereunder), convert, continue or
prepay any Term Benchmark Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (whether or not such notice may
be revoked in accordance with the terms hereof) or (d) the assignment of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by Parent pursuant to Section 2.16, then, in any such event, Parent shall (subject to the
penultimate sentence of this Section) compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (but not for any anticipated profits) attributable to
such event, including, to the extent that any of the foregoing Loans are denominated in an Alternative Currency, the actual costs and expenses of
such Lender attributable to the premature unwinding of any Hedge Agreement entered into by such Lender in respect to the foreign currency
exposure attributable to such Loan. Parent shall also compensate each Lender for any loss, cost and expense attributable to any failure by any
Borrower to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Loan. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, including in reasonable detail a description of the basis for
such compensation and a calculation of such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to Parent and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Parent shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof.
 
 
50
 
SECTION 2.14.     Payments Free of Taxes. (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party
under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable
law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any
such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall
timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an
Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding
has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) the applicable
Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(b)            Payment of Other Taxes and VAT. The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes and VAT.
 
(c)            Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental
Authority pursuant to this Section 2.14, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such
payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(d)            Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within
30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to
such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
Parent by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(e)            Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 30 days
after written demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not
already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so),
(ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant
Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in
connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).
 
 
51
 
(f)            Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect
to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Parent and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by
Parent or the Administrative Agent, such information or properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Parent or the
Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition and subject to
Section 2.14(g), any Lender, if reasonably requested by Parent or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other information or
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Parent or the Administrative Agent as will enable Parent or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other
than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.14(f)(ii)(A), 2.14(f)(ii)(B) and 2.14(f)(ii)(D)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable
judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially
prejudice the legal, tax or commercial position of such Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an applicable Borrower or any other
applicable Loan Party that, in each case, is not a US Person or is not resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes, the
applicable Lender will not be subject to the requirements of this paragraph (f)(i) unless it has received written notice from such Borrower or such
other Loan Party advising it of the availability of an exemption or reduction of withholding Tax under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such
Borrower or such other Loan Party is located and containing all applicable documentation (together, if requested by such Lender, with a certified
English translation thereof) required to be completed by such Lender in order to receive any such exemption or reduction, and such Lender is
reasonably satisfied that it is legally able to provide such documentation to such Borrower or such other Loan Party.
 
(ii)            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is a US Person:
 
(A)            (i) any Lender that is a US Person shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior
to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies (by facsimile or electronic mail (in .pdf or
.tif format)) of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from US backup withholding tax, and (ii) the Applicable
Agent with respect to such Borrower shall deliver to such Borrower on or prior to the date on which such Applicable Agent
becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower), executed
copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Applicable Agent is exempt from US Federal backup withholding Tax;
 
(B)            any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
 
52
 
(1)            in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United
States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-
8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, US withholding Tax
pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any
Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or
reduction of, US Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax
treaty;
 
(2)            executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)               in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign
Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of any of
the Borrowers within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described
in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-
8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or
 
(4)            to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY,
accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other
certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership
and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such
Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of
each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)            any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in US Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the
withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)            if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to US Federal withholding Tax
imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including
those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to such Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower
or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)
(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as
may be necessary for such Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to
determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct
and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to
FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Parent and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(g)            (i)  Each Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax on interest payable by Amcor
UK under any applicable double taxation treaty to which the United Kingdom is a party, and that holds a passport number under the HMRC
Double Taxation Passport scheme and wishes that scheme to apply to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, shall include an indication
to that effect by including its HMRC Double Taxation Passport scheme reference number in such Lender’s Administrative Questionnaire and its
jurisdiction of tax residence (or otherwise provide the scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence to the Administrative Agent
and Parent, for the benefit of Amcor UK) and subject to paragraph (g)(iii) below, having so provided its HMRC Double Taxation Passport
scheme reference number shall be under no further obligation pursuant to Section 2.14(f) in respect of Amcor UK.
 
 
53
 
(ii)            Where a Lender includes the indication described in paragraph (g)(i) above, Amcor UK shall file a duly completed
form DTTP2 with respect to each such Lender with HMRC within 30 days of the date such Lender becomes a Lender hereunder, and shall
promptly provide such Lender with a copy of that filing. No Borrower shall file a form DTTP2 or file any other form relating to the HMRC
Double Tax Passport scheme unless a Lender has provided its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with
paragraph (g)(i) above or such Lender otherwise agrees.
 
(iii)            If a Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with
paragraph (g)(i) above and Amcor UK has not filed a duly completed form DTTP2 in respect of such Lender or Amcor UK has filed a duly
completed DTTP2 in respect of such Lender but (y) the form DTTP2 has been rejected by HMRC or (z) HMRC has not given Amcor UK
authority to make payments to such Lender without withholding or deduction on account of Tax within 60 days of the date Amcor UK filed a
duly completed DTTP2 in respect of such Lender and, in the case of clause (y) or (z), Amcor UK has notified such Lender thereof in writing,
such Lender and Amcor UK shall co-operate in completing any additional procedural formalities necessary for Amcor UK to obtain authorization
to make that payment without any withholding or deduction on account of Tax.
 
(h)            Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has
received a refund of any Taxes (which, for purposes of this Section 2.14, with respect to Taxes which arise in the United Kingdom, shall include a
credit against or relief of any such Taxes) as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.14 (including by the payment of
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount
paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the
event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this
paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would
have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require
any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(i)            United Kingdom Taxation. Each of Parent and Amcor UK represents and warrants that it is resident for Tax purposes
only in the United Kingdom. Each of Amcor Australia, Amcor US and Amcor Flexibles represents and warrants that it is not resident for Tax
purposes in the United Kingdom.
 
(j)            Australian Taxation. (i)  Each Arranger represents to Amcor Australia that (A) on behalf of Amcor Australia, it has
made invitations to become a Lender under this Agreement to 10 or more Persons, each of whom, as at the date the relevant invitation was made,
such Arranger’s officers or employees involved in the day to day syndication process reasonably believed was carrying on the business of
providing finance or investing or dealing in securities in the course of operating in financial markets, and (B) such Arranger’s officers or
employees involved in the day to day syndication process reasonably believed 10 or more of such invitees were not Associates of each other or of
Amcor Australia.
 
(ii)            Amcor Australia confirms that none of the potential invitees whose names were disclosed to it by an Arranger before
the date of this Agreement were known or suspected by it to be an Offshore Associate of Amcor Australia. Amcor Australia also confirms that
each Borrower under this Agreement is (A) a member of the same “wholly-owned group” (as defined in the Australian Tax Act) or (B) an
Associate of each other Borrower.
 
(iii)            Each Lender listed in Schedule 2.01 represents and warrants that (A) an invitation to become a Lender under this
Agreement was made to it by the Arrangers on behalf of Amcor Australia, (B) it was at the time of the invitation, and will be at the time of
making by it of any Loan to Amcor Australia, carrying on a business of providing finance, or investing or dealing in securities, in the course of
operating in financial markets and (C) except as disclosed to Amcor Australia, insofar as its officers and agents who were involved in its
becoming a party to this Agreement have actual knowledge, it is not an Associate of any other Person which was invited to become a Lender
under the Agreement.
 
 
54
 
(iv)            At the cost of Amcor Australia, each of the Lenders and the Arrangers will, to the extent it is reasonably able to do
so, do or provide such other things (including information) which Amcor Australia reasonably requests it to do or provide in connection with the
invitations to become Lenders under this Agreement which Amcor Australia considers practicable and necessary to demonstrate that the
requirements of section 128F of the Australian Tax Act are satisfied.
 
(k)            Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.14 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
(l)            VAT. (i)  All amounts set out or expressed in a Loan Document to be payable by any party to any Recipient that (in
whole or in part) constitute the consideration for a supply for VAT purposes shall, except as otherwise agreed by such Recipient, be deemed to be
exclusive of any VAT that is chargeable on such supply. Subject to paragraph (ii) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by
any Recipient to any party under a Loan Document, such party shall pay to such Recipient (in addition to and at the same time as paying any
other consideration for such supply), an amount equal to the amount of such VAT (and such Recipient shall have delivered to such party an
invoice complying with the applicable legal requirements) unless such party is obligated by law to account directly to the applicable
Governmental Authority for such VAT. If there is an adjustment to the consideration in respect of a supply to which this Section 2.14(l)(i) applies,
(A) the additional amount paid or payable to the applicable Recipient must be recalculated, taking into account any previous adjustments under
this clause (A), to reflect the occurrence of such adjustment and the other party or the Recipient, as the case requires, must pay to the other the
amount required to reflect the recalculation of the additional amount, and (B) the Recipient must provide any relevant documentation in respect
of the adjustment (including, if relevant, an adjustment note) to the other party as soon as practicable after the Recipient becomes aware of the
occurrence of such adjustment.
 
(ii)           If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (the “VAT
Supplier”) to any other Lender (the “VAT Recipient”) under a Loan Document, and any party other than the VAT Recipient (the “VAT Relevant
Party”) is required by the terms of any Loan Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the VAT Supplier (rather
than being required to reimburse or indemnify the VAT Recipient in respect of that consideration) (x) (where the VAT Supplier is the Person
required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the VAT Relevant Party shall also pay to the VAT Supplier (at the same time as
paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The VAT Recipient shall (where the immediately foregoing
clause (x) applies) promptly pay to the VAT Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the VAT Recipient receives from the
relevant tax authority which the VAT Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply and (y) (where the VAT
Recipient is the Person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the VAT Relevant Party shall promptly, following demand
from the VAT Recipient, pay to the VAT Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the VAT
Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.
  
(iii)          Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify any Recipient for any cost or expense, such
party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Recipient for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as
represents VAT, except to the extent that such Recipient reasonably determines that it, or any company of its group, is entitled to credit or
repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.
 
(iv)          Any reference in paragraphs (i) through (iii) above to any party shall, at any time when such party is treated as a
member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative
member of such group at such time (the term “representative member” to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994 or
equivalent legislation and the council directive 2006/112/EEC on the common system of value added tax).
 
 
55
 
(v)            In relation to any supply made by a Recipient to any party under a Loan Document, if reasonably requested by such
Recipient, such party must promptly provide such Recipient with details of such party’s VAT registration and such other information as is
reasonably requested in connection with such Recipient’s VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.
 
(m)            Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.14, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.
 
SECTION 2.15.     Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs. (a)  Each Borrower shall make each payment
required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Documents prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan
Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, then, in the case of payments in US Dollars, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the date when due and, in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, no later than the Applicable Time specified by the
Administrative Agent), in immediately available funds, without any defense, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim. Any amounts received after
such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for
purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent to such account as the Applicable Agent shall
from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to Parent, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.03 shall be
made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The
Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such
extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in
the currency of such Loan; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment
required to be made by any Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if such Agent shall, at or before such time,
have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement
system used by such Agent to make such payment.
 
(b)            If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Agents to pay fully all amounts of principal,
interest and fees then due, and expenses then reimbursable, hereunder, such funds shall be applied towards payment of the amounts then so due
or reimbursable as follows:
 
FIRST, to the payment of all fees then due, and all costs and expenses then due or reimbursable, to the Agents (in their capacity
as such) under any Loan Document; and
 
SECOND, to the payment of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents to the Lenders (ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts then due to such parties).
 
(c)            If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its
Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
notify the Administrative Agent and shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the amount of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of principal of and accrued
interest on their Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by Parent or any other Loan Party pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including pursuant to Sections 2.07(b)) and 2.19 or any other Loan Document (for the
avoidance of doubt, as in effect from time to time) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans to any Person that is an Eligible Assignee (as such term is defined from time to time). Each of Parent and the
Borrowers consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against Parent or such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of Parent or such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
 
56
 
(d)            Unless an Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to such
Agent for the account of any Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, such Agent may assume that such Borrower has
made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the
amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally agrees to repay to
such Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to such Agent, at (i) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of (A) the NYFRB
Rate and (B) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) if denominated in an
Alternative Currency, the greater of (A) the rate reasonably determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which
determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) and (B) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation.
 
(e)            If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account of any Agent,
then each Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by any Agent
for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations in respect of such payment until all such unsatisfied obligations have been
discharged or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such
Lender pursuant to Sections 2.04(b), 2.14(e), 2.15(d) and 9.03(c), in each case in such order as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent
in its discretion.
 
SECTION 2.16.     Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a)  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under
Section 2.12, (ii) the Loan Parties are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes (other than VAT that is recoverable from any Governmental
Authority) or additional amounts to any Lender or to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 (other
than additional amounts arising from VAT that are recoverable from any Governmental Authority) (or if it becomes reasonably likely that such
compensation or payment will be required to be made) or (iii) any Lender gives notice of illegality pursuant to Section 2.19, then such Lender
shall (at the request of Parent) use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates if, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12
or 2.14 or would permit such Lender to withdraw such notice of illegality, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender
to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Parent hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
 
(b)            If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any Indemnified
Taxes (other than VAT that is recoverable from any Governmental Authority) or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 (other than additional amounts arising from VAT that are recoverable from any
Governmental Authority), (iii) any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, (iv) any Lender is a Declining Lender, (v) any Lender has given
notice of illegality pursuant to Section 2.19 or (vi) any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination
that under Section 9.02 requires the consent of all the Lenders (or all the affected Lenders) and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall
have granted their consent, Parent may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests,
rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.12, 2.14 and 9.03) and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment
and delegation); provided that (A) Parent shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal
of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (in the case of such principal
and accrued interest and fees) or Parent (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a
claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction
in such compensation or payments, (D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law, (E) in the case of any such assignment and
delegation resulting from the status of such Lender as a Declining Lender, the assignee shall have agreed to the applicable Maturity Date
Extension Request and (F) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall
have given such consent. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver or
consent by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Parent to require such assignment and delegation have ceased to apply. Each
party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and
Assumption executed by Parent, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation
need not be a party thereto.
 
SECTION 2.17.     Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender
becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
 
(a)            commitment fees shall cease to accrue on the Unused Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 2.09(a) for any period during which such Defaulting Lender is a “Defaulting Lender”; and
 
57
 
(b)            the Commitment and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining
whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan
Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that any
amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise
provided in Section 9.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
In the event that the Administrative Agent and Parent each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters
that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as
the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage, and such Lender shall thereupon cease to be a Defaulting Lender (but shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fees accrued
during the period when it was a Defaulting Lender, and all amendments, waivers or other modifications effected without its consent in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.02 and this Section 2.17 during such period shall be binding on it). The rights and remedies against,
and with respect to, a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.17 are in addition to, and cumulative and not in limitation of, all other rights and
remedies that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Borrower may at any time have against, or with respect to, such Defaulting Lender.
 
SECTION 2.18.     Concerning Subsidiary Borrowers. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Parent to serve as its agent
for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including (a) the giving and receipt of notices (including any Borrowing
Request and any Interest Election Request) and (b) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein.
Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that any amendment or other modification to this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be effected
as set forth in Section 9.02, that such Person shall be bound by this Agreement or any other Loan Document (if it is theretofore a party thereto) as
so amended or modified and that no consent of such Person shall be required to effect any such amendment or other modification.
 
SECTION 2.19.     Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted after the Effective Date that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable lending office to make,
maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to any Relevant Rate (or any component thereof) or to determine or charge
interest rates based upon the Relevant Rate (or any component thereof), then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Parent through the
Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans of the applicable Type (or, in the case of Loans denominated
in US Dollars, to convert Loans to such applicable Type) shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or
maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, the
interest rate on such ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without
reference to the Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case, until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and Parent
that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which notice such Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon receipt of such
notice, (i) the applicable Borrowers shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from the relevant Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), prepay all of such Lender’s Loans of the applicable Type or, in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, convert all of
such Lender’s Loans of such Type to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such
illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate) on, in the case
of Term Benchmark Loans, the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark
Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans (in which case the
Borrower shall not be required to make payments pursuant to Section 2.10 in connection with such payment) and, in the case of RFR Loans, on
the next Interest Payment Date, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such RFR Loans to such date, or immediately, if such Lender
may not lawfully continue to maintain such RFR Loans to such date (in which case the Borrower shall not be required to make payments
pursuant to Section 2.10 in connection with such payment), (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging
interest rates based upon the Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate
applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such
affected Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term SOFR (which notice such
Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted.

ARTICLE III
 
Representations and Warranties
 
Parent, as to itself and the Subsidiaries, and each Borrower, as to itself and its subsidiaries, represents and warrants to the
Lenders, as of the Effective Date and thereafter as of each date on which representations and warranties are required to be, or are deemed to be,
made under the Loan Documents, that:
 
SECTION 3.01.     Organization, Existence and Good Standing; Powers. Each Loan Party is duly formed, incorporated or
organized, as applicable, validly existing and (to the extent the concept is applicable in such jurisdiction) in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation, incorporation or organization, as applicable, has all power and authority and all material Governmental Approvals
required for the ownership and operation of its properties and the conduct of its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business, and is in
good standing (to the extent the concept is applicable in such jurisdiction), in every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
 
SECTION 3.02.     Corporate and Governmental Authorization. The Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party are
within such Loan Party’s corporate or other organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
organizational and, if required, stockholder or other equityholder action of each Loan Party. The Transactions do not require any consent or
approval of, or any registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made
and are in full force and effect.
 
SECTION 3.03.     Enforceability of Obligations. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and each
Borrower, and this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and each Borrower, and each other Loan Document to
which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Loan Party, in each case, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law.
 
SECTION 3.04.     No Contravention or Exceeding Power. The Transactions (a) do not and will not violate any material law,
including any order of any Governmental Authority, applicable to or binding upon any Loan Party or any of its properties, (b) do not and will not
violate the charter, by-laws, constitutional documents or other organizational documents of any Loan Party, or any limitations on its powers or the
powers of its directors or other governing or managing body, (c) do not and will not violate or result (alone or with notice or lapse of time, or
both) in a default under (i)  the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement or the Existing Note Documents or (ii) any other indenture or credit
agreement or any other agreement or instrument binding upon Parent or any Subsidiary or any of their assets, except, in the case of this
clause (ii), to the extent that any such default, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and (d) do not and will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or any Subsidiary. No Loan Party
organized under the laws of Australia has contravened or will contravene part 2J.3 of the Corporations Act in connection with its execution,
delivery or performance of any Loan Document.
 
SECTION 3.05.     Financial Statements; No Material Adverse Change. (a)  Parent has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
Consolidated Financial Statements (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, audited by and accompanied by the opinion of
PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, independent registered public accounting firm, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarters and the portion of the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Such Consolidated Financial Statements, and all subsequent Consolidated Financial
Statements provided by Parent pursuant to Section 5.01, have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP and present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby on a consolidated basis in accordance with US GAAP, in the case of
clause (ii) above, subject to the absence of certain footnotes and normal year-end audit adjustments. As of December 31, 2021, neither Parent nor
any Subsidiary had any material actual or contingent liabilities except as disclosed or reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the
fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
 
 
59
 
 
(b)            There has been, as of the Effective Date, no event or condition since June 30, 2021, that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, financial position or results of operations of Parent and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
 
SECTION 3.06.     Accuracy of Disclosure. (a)  Neither the Confidential Materials nor any of the other reports, financial
statements, certificates or other written information furnished by or on behalf of Parent or any Subsidiary to any Agent, any Arranger or any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or furnished hereunder or thereunder, nor any
information formally presented prior to the Effective Date to any Agent, any Arranger or any Lender in bank meetings or conference calls in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (in each case, other than information of a general economic or
industry nature), taken as a whole, contained, as of the date when furnished or presented, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state, as of the date when furnished or presented, a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not materially
misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made; provided that, with respect to projected financial information,
Parent and the Borrowers represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed by management of
Parent to be reasonable at the time such projected financial information was prepared (it being understood that such projected financial
information is subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond control of Parent and the Subsidiaries, that no
assurance can be given that such projected financial information will be realized, and that such projected financial information may differ
materially from actual future results). As of the Effective Date, Parent and the Borrowers have disclosed to the Lenders all agreements,
instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which Parent or any Subsidiary is subject, and all other matters relating to Parent and the
Subsidiaries known to the Borrowers, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b)            If a Beneficial Ownership Certification is required to be delivered pursuant to any Loan Document, then, as of the
date of the delivery thereof, the information set forth in such Beneficial Ownership Certification is true and correct in all respects.
 
SECTION 3.07.     Properties. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its
property, except where the failure to have such title or leasehold interests, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
SECTION 3.08.     Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a)  There are (in the case of clause (i) below, as of the Effective
Date) no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Parent or
the Borrowers, threatened against or affecting Parent or any Subsidiary (i) that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or (iii) to wind up or dissolve (or effect any analogous or similar
action) Parent, any Borrower or any other Subsidiary and that, in the case of any such other Subsidiary, would reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b)            Except with respect to any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, none of Parent or any Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or
comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) currently expects to be required to incur any
capital or other cost for its respective operations to achieve or maintain compliance with any Environmental Law relating to greenhouse gas
emissions or reductions thereto, (iii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iv) has received notice of any claim with respect to any
Environmental Liability or (v) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.
 
 
60
 
SECTION 3.09.     Compliance with Laws and Agreements. (a)  Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
laws, including all orders of Governmental Authorities, applicable to it or its property, except where the failure to comply, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and the Subsidiaries is in compliance, in all
material respects, with Anti-Corruption Laws.
 
(b)            Parent and each Subsidiary (in each case, to the extent a party thereto) is in compliance with the Existing Note
Documents, the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, all other indentures and credit agreements to which it is a party and all other agreements
and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.
 
SECTION 3.10.     Investment Company Status. None of Parent or any other Loan Party is an “investment company” as
defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
SECTION 3.11.     ERISA.  No ERISA Events have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur that would, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The excess of the present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under each
Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715) over the fair value of the assets of such Plan,
as of the date of the most recent Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting such amounts, did not, and could not reasonably be expected to,
result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, (i) each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or may rely upon an
opinion letter for a prototype plan letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter is currently being processed by the IRS with respect
thereto, and (ii) as of the date of this Agreement, to Parent’s knowledge, nothing has occurred which would reasonably be expected to prevent, or
cause the loss of, such qualification.
 
SECTION 3.12.     Ranking of Obligations. The obligations of each Loan Party under the Loan Documents to which it is a
party rank at least equally with all of the unsecured and unsubordinated Financial Indebtedness of such Loan Party, except liabilities mandatorily
(and not consensually) preferred by law, and ahead of all subordinated indebtedness, if any, of such Loan Party.
 
SECTION 3.13.     Related Parties. No Loan Party subject to the Corporations Act has contravened or will contravene
section 208 or section 209 of the Corporations Act by executing and delivering any Loan Document or performing its obligations thereunder or
participating in any transaction in connection with any Loan Document.
 
SECTION 3.14.     Benefit from Transactions. Each Loan Party benefits by the execution, delivery and performance of the
Loan Documents to which it is a party.
 
SECTION 3.15.     Execution not as a Trustee. No Loan Party has executed or delivered any Loan Document in the capacity of
a trustee, responsible entity or custodian of any trust, managed investment scheme or settlement.
 
SECTION 3.16.     Federal Reserve Regulations. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary is engaged or will engage, principally or as
one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of
Governors), or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock. No part of the proceeds of the Loans will be used,
directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation (including on the part of any Lender) of any of the regulations of the Board of
Governors, including Regulations U and X. Not more than 25% of the value of the assets subject to any restrictions on the sale, pledge or other
disposition of assets under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement between Parent or any Subsidiary and any Lender
or Affiliate of a Lender will at any time be represented by margin stock.
 
 
61
 
SECTION 3.17.     Anti-Corruption Laws; Sanctions; FATF Public Statement Jurisdiction. Parent has implemented and
maintains in effect policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by Parent, the Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions, and Parent, the Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers and employees and, to the knowledge of Parent, its and the Subsidiaries’ respective directors and agents, are in compliance with Anti-
Corruption Laws in all material respects and are in compliance with applicable Sanctions. None of Parent, any Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of
Parent or the Borrowers, any of their respective directors, officers or employees, or their respective agents that will act in any capacity in
connection with or benefit from the credit facility established hereby, is a Sanctioned Person. No Borrowing, use of proceeds or other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will violate Anti-Corruption Laws or applicable Sanctions. None of Parent, any Borrower or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or any director, officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, is a Person that is, or is owned or controlled
by Persons that are, located, organized or resident in a FATF Public Statement Jurisdiction.
 
SECTION 3.18.     Choice of Law Provisions. The choice of law provisions set forth in Section 9.09 are legal, valid and
binding under the laws of Australia, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the United Kingdom and each other jurisdiction in which any Non-US Loan Party is
organized, and none of Parent or the Borrowers knows of any reason why the courts of Australia, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the United Kingdom or
any such other jurisdiction will not give effect to the choice of law of the State of New York as the proper law, other than through the exercise by
any such court of discretionary powers under general principles of equity or public policy limitations in each case not specifically relating to such
provisions. Amcor Australia has the legal capacity to sue and be sued in its own name under the laws of Australia, Parent has the legal capacity to
sue and be sued in its own names under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Amcor UK has the legal capacity to sue and be sued in its own name
under the laws of the United Kingdom and each other Non-US Loan Party has the legal capacity to sue and be sued in its own name under the
laws of its jurisdiction of formation, incorporation or organization, as applicable. Each of the Non-US Loan Parties has the power to submit, and
has irrevocably submitted, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of
the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and such irrevocable submission
and the waiver by each Non-US Loan Party of any immunity and any objection to the venue of the proceedings in such Federal or State court are
legal, valid and binding obligations of such Non-US Loan Party, and none of Parent or the Borrowers knows of any reason why the courts of
Australia, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction where any Non-US Loan Party is organized would not give
effect to such submission and waivers, other than through the exercise by any such court of discretionary powers under general principles of
equity or based on public policy limitations in each case not specifically relating to such submission and waivers. Each Non-US Loan Party has
validly and irrevocably appointed the Authorized Agent as its authorized agent for the purpose described in Section 9.09(e). Service of process in
the manner set forth in Section 9.09(d) will be effective to confer valid personal jurisdiction over each Non-US Loan Party, and none of Parent or
the Borrowers knows of any reason why the courts in Australia, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction where any
Non-US Loan Party is organized will not recognize as valid and final, or will not enforce, any final and conclusive judgment against Parent,
Amcor Australia, Amcor UK or such other Non-US Loan Party, respectively, obtained in any such Federal or State court arising out of or in
relation to the obligations of Parent, Amcor Australia, Amcor UK or such other Non-US Loan Party under the Loan Documents, other than
through the exercise by any such court of discretionary powers under general principles of equity or public policy limitations in each case not
specifically relating to jurisdictional matters (including consent to service of process provisions).
 
 
62
 
SECTION 3.19.     No Immunity. Each Non-US Loan Party is subject to civil and commercial laws with respect to its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, and the execution, delivery and performance by such Non-
US Loan Party of this Agreement and any other Loan Documents to which it is a party constitute and will constitute private and commercial acts
and not public or governmental acts. None of the Non-US Loan Parties or any of their properties has any immunity from jurisdiction of any court
or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or
otherwise) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Non-US Loan Party is organized and existing in respect of its obligations under this
Agreement and any other Loan Documents to which it is a party.
 
SECTION 3.20.     Proper Form; No Recordation. With respect to each Non-US Loan Party, this Agreement and each other
Loan Document to which it is a party are in proper legal form under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Non-US Loan Party is organized
and existing for the enforcement thereof against such Non-US Loan Party under the laws of such jurisdiction and to ensure the legality, validity,
enforceability, priority or admissibility in evidence of this Agreement and such other Loan Documents. It is not necessary, in order to ensure the
legality, validity, enforceability, priority or admissibility in evidence of this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which any Non-US Loan
Party is party, that this Agreement or such other Loan Document be filed, registered or recorded with, or executed or notarized before, any court
or other Governmental Authority in the jurisdiction in which such Non-US Loan Party is organized and existing or that any registration charge or
stamp or similar tax be paid on or in respect of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document, except for (a) any such filing, registration,
recording, execution or notarization as has been made or is not required to be made until the applicable Loan Document is sought to be enforced
and (b) any charge or tax as has been timely paid by such Non-US Loan Party.
 
ARTICLE IV
 
Conditions
 
SECTION 4.01.     Effective Date. This Agreement shall become effective on the first date on which each of the following

Lenders, by notice to Parent, take any or all of the following actions, at the same or different times:  (i) terminate the Commitments, and
thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part
(but ratably as among the Loans at the time outstanding), in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be
declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest
thereon and all fees and other obligations of Parent or the Borrowers hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, in each case without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Parent and each Borrower; and in the case of any
event with respect to Parent or any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the
principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of Parent or any Borrower
hereunder, shall immediately and automatically become due and payable, in each case without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Parent and each Borrower.
 
ARTICLE VIII
 
The Agents
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent and the Foreign Administrative Agent as its agents
and authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Foreign Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as
are delegated to the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Administrative Agent, as applicable, by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with
such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender exempts the Agents from the restrictions pursuant to Section 181 Civil
Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) and similar restrictions applicable to it pursuant to any other applicable law, in each case to the extent legally
possible for such Lender. Any Lender that cannot grant such exemption shall notify the Administrative Agent accordingly and, upon request of
the Administrative Agent, either act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or any other Loan Document as required pursuant to this
Agreement and/or such other Loan Document or grant a special power of attorney to a party acting on its behalf, in a manner that is not
prohibited pursuant to Section 181 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) and/or any other applicable laws. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, each of the Loan Documents to
which such Agent is a party, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies that such Agent may have under such Loan Documents.
 
 
72
 
Any Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with Parent or
any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and in performing its
functions and duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, each Agent is acting solely on behalf of the Lenders (except in limited
circumstances expressly provided for herein relating to the maintenance of the Register), and its functions and duties are entirely mechanical and
administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agents do not assume, and shall not be deemed to have
assumed, any obligation or duty or any other relationship as the agent, fiduciary or trustee of or for any Lender or any other Person, other than as
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood
and agreed that the use of the term “agent” (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with reference to the Administrative
Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary duty or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law,
and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
contracting parties), and each Lender agrees that it will not assert any claim against any Agent based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by
such Agent in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) the Agents
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or to exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated by the Loan Documents that an Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as
provided in the Loan Documents), provided that an Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose such Agent to
liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Agents shall
not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Parent, any Subsidiary or any other
Affiliate of Parent that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Neither any
Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary,
under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents) or (ii) unless a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by a final and
non-appealable judgment that such Agent was grossly negligent or acted with willful misconduct in taking or not taking any such action. Each
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof (stating that it is a “notice of default”) is
given to such Agent by Parent or a Lender, and the Agents shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (A) any
statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (B) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (C) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (D) the sufficiency, value, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with
any Agent’s reliance on any Electronic Signature transmitted by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an
actual executed signature page), (E) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to
confirm receipt of items (which on their face purport to be such items) expressly required to be delivered to such Agent or satisfaction of any
condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to an Agent or (F) any determination with respect
to (1) the existence or the extent of any legal impediments on the ability of any Subsidiary Guarantor or Parent to perform its obligations under
the Guarantee Agreement (it being acknowledged by the Lenders that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to make any evaluation as to
whether any such impediment exists unless and until it shall have been requested to do so in writing by a Lender and, in connection with any
such evaluation or determination, may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Parent) selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel) or (2) the terms of the subordination referred to in the
definition of the term the Subordinated Debt Allowance. Each Agent shall be deemed to have no knowledge of any Lender being a Restricted
Lender unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received the written notice from such Lender referred to in Section 1.11, and then
only to as and to the extent specified in such notice, and any determination of whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders shall
have provided any consent or direction in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not be affected by any subsequent
delivery to the Administrative Agent of any such written notice. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Agent shall be liable for, or
be responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by any Loan Party or any Lender as a result of, any such determination of the Revolving
Credit Exposure or the component amounts thereof or of the US Dollar Equivalent. Each Lender agrees that nothing in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall require any Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any
of its functions or duties under the Loan Documents or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for
believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
 
73
 
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for acting or not acting upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or
other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not
such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof). Each Agent
also shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for acting or not acting upon, any statement made to it orally or by telephone
and believed by it to be made by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents
for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof), and may act upon any such statement prior to receipt of written confirmation thereof,
including pursuant to Section 9.01(e). In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, the Administrative
Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to each Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary
from such Lender sufficiently in advance of the making of such Loan. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
Parent), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with
the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may treat the payee of any promissory note as its holder until such
promissory note has been assigned in accordance with Section 9.04 and may rely on the Register to the extent set forth in Section 9.04(c).
 
Each Agent may perform any of and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan
Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any of and all
their duties and exercise their rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to
any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the credit facility provided for herein as well as activities as an Agent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that
such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
 
 
74
 
Subject to the terms of this paragraph, each Agent may resign at any time from its capacity as such. In connection with such
resignation, such Agent shall give notice of its intent to resign to the Lenders and Parent. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the
Required Lenders (in the case of a resignation by the Administrative Agent) or the Administrative Agent (in the case of a resignation by the
Foreign Administrative Agent) shall have the right (with, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, in the case of a successor to the
Administrative Agent, or with an office in London or Frankfurt, in the case of a successor to the Foreign Administrative Agent or, in each case,
an Affiliate of any such bank. If any Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to Parent and such Agent remove such Agent in its capacity as such, and (with, so
long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned)) appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent or Foreign Administrative Agent, as
applicable, hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring or removed Agent, as the case may be, and such retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by Parent to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed by Parent and such successor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (a) no successor Agent to a retiring Agent
shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intent to resign,
the retiring Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders and Parent or (b) no successor to a removed Agent shall
have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment by the day that is 30 days following of the issuance of a notice of removal, the
removal shall become effective on such 30th day, and on the date of effectiveness of such resignation or removal, as the case may be, (i) the
retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (ii) the
Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent; provided
that (A) all payments required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the retiring or removed Agent for the account of any
Person other than such Agent shall be made directly to such Person and (B) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be
given or made to the retiring or removed Agent shall also directly be given or made to the other Agent and each Lender. After any Agent’s
resignation or removal from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and
indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as an
Agent. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Foreign Administrative Agent under the penultimate paragraph of this
Article.
 
Each Lender represents and warrants that (a) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility, (b) it is
engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and in providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender,
in each case, in the ordinary course of business, and not for the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument
(and each Lender agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing), (c) it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents,
any other Titled Person or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold
Loans hereunder and (d) it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities
set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire
and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or
providing such other facilities. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, any other Titled
Person or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information (which may
contain Private Side Information) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement on the Effective Date, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and
Assumption, the Accession Agreement or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to
have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be
approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on or prior to the date of such document.
 
 
75
 
Each Lender, by becoming a party to this Agreement, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and
approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, any Agent or the
Lenders on or prior to the Effective Date.
 
Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if any Agent notifies such Lender that such Agent has determined in its sole discretion that
any funds received by such Lender from such Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal,
interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively, a “Payment”) were erroneously transmitted to such Lender (whether or not known to
such Lender), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business
Day thereafter, return to such Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day
funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such
Lender to the date such amount is repaid to such Agent at (a) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of (i) the NYFRB Rate and (ii) a rate
determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (b) if denominated in an Alternative
Currency, the greater of (i) the rate reasonably determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which determination will be
conclusive absent manifest error) and (ii) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation,
and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to such Agent, any claim, counterclaim,
defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by such Agent for the return of any Payments
received, including without limitation any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. A notice of any Agent to any Lender
under this paragraph shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from any Agent or
any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by such Agent (or
any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a “Payment Notice”) or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it
shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment. Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if
it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Applicable Agent
of such occurrence and, upon demand from such Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to such
Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest
thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such
amount is repaid to such Agent at (a) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of (i) the NYFRB Rate and (ii) a rate determined by such Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (b) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, the greater of (i) the rate
reasonably determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error)
and (ii) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Parent and the Borrowers hereby
agree (and each other Loan Party, by becoming a party to the Guarantee Agreement shall be deemed to have agreed) that (x) in the event an
erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) are not recovered from any Lender that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the
Agents shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay,
repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party. Each party’s obligations under this
paragraph shall survive the resignation or replacement of any Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender,
the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under any Loan Document.
 
In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, each Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due
and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether such Agent shall have made any demand on any
Borrower or other Loan Party) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
 
76
 
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans that
are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and
the Agents (including any claim under Sections 2.09, 2.10, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Lender to make such payments to any Agent and, in the event that any Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Lenders, to pay to such Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03);
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Agents to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf
of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the obligations or the rights of any Lender, or to vote
in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents or the Documentation Agents
(each of the foregoing, a “Titled Person”) shall have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except in its
capacity, as applicable, as a Lender), but all such Persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder, and, without limiting
the foregoing, no Titled Person shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or with Parent or any of its Affiliates.
 
Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from
the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, each Agent and
each Titled Person and their respective Affiliates and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower or any other Loan
Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
 
(a)            such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more
Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the
Commitments or this Agreement,
 
(b)            the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions
involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company
pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE
96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s
entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement,
 
 
77
 
(c)            (i) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of
Part VI of PTE 84-14), (ii) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter
into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, (iii) the entrance into, participation in,
administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-
sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (iv) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of
Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the
Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, or
 
(d)            such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in
its sole discretion, and such Lender.
 
In addition, unless either (1) clause (a) in the immediately preceding paragraph is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender
has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with clause (d) in the immediately preceding paragraph, such Lender
further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person
became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and each
Titled Person and their respective Affiliates and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower or any other Loan Party,
that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in,
administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise
of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).
 
The Foreign Administrative Agent (the “Designating Foreign Administrative Agent”) may at any time and from time to time,
by written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Parent, nominate an Affiliate of the Designating Foreign Administrative Agent
(such Affiliate, a “Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent”) to act as a successor Foreign Administrative Agent. A notice to nominate a
Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent must be in the form of Exhibit G (the “Foreign Administrative Agent Designation Notice”) and be
countersigned by the Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent confirming it will be bound as the Foreign Administrative Agent under this
Agreement. Such Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the Foreign
Administrative Agent, and the term “Foreign Administrative Agent” shall mean such Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent effective
immediately upon delivery of such Foreign Administrative Agent Designation Notice to the Administrative Agent. With respect to
Section 9.01(a)(ii), the address for notices for the Foreign Administrative Agent shall be, upon such succession and without further action, the
address for the Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent set forth in the Foreign Administrative Agent Designation Notice. A Substitute Foreign
Administrative Agent will be treated as the Foreign Administrative Agent for all purposes under the Loan Documents for so long as it continues
to be a Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent under this Agreement. The Designating Foreign Administrative Agent may revoke its
designation of an Affiliate as a Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent by notice in writing to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
Parent.  Upon such Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent’s ceasing to be a Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent, the Designating Foreign
Administrative Agent will automatically assume (and be deemed to assume without further action by any party) all rights and obligations
previously vested in such Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent.
 
 
78
 
The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and, except solely to the extent of
Parent’s rights to consent pursuant to and subject to the conditions set forth in this Article, none of Parent or any other Loan Party shall have any
rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions.

and their respective Related Parties do not warrant, and shall not be deemed to warrant, the adequacy of the Platform or the Communications, and
expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any
warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects,
is made, or shall be deemed to be made, by any Agent, any Titled Person or any of their respective Related Parties in connection with the
Communications or the Platform. In no event shall any Agent, any Titled Person or any of their respective Related Parties have any liability, on
any theory of liability, to any Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person for Liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) arising out of any Loan Party’s, any Agent’s or any Titled Person’s transmission of communications through the Platform, except to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Person acted with gross negligence or
willful misconduct; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent, any Titled Person or any of their respective Related Parties have any
liability, on any theory of liability, to any Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages). Parent, each Borrower and each Lender agrees that any Agent or any Titled Person may, but shall not be
obligated to, store any Communications on the Platform in accordance with its customary document retention procedures and policies.
 
SECTION 9.02.     Waivers; Amendments. (a)  No failure or delay by any Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to
any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and
then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Arranger, any Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent or any Lender may have had notice
or knowledge of such Default at the time.
 
 
80
 
(b)            Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section, none of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements
in writing entered into by Parent, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders and, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to
an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in
each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender, or change
the currency in which Loans are available thereunder, without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or
reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, or change the currency of any Loan or any interest or fee, without the
written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled maturity date of any Loan or any date for the payment of any
interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of
any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.15(b) or 2.15(c) in a manner that would
alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this
Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of the term “Required Lenders” or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender or (vi) release (including by limiting liability in respect thereof) (A) any Borrower or
Parent from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement or (B) one or more Subsidiary Guarantors (other than those that are also Borrowers)
from their Guarantees under the Guarantee Agreement if such Guarantees represent a material portion of the aggregate value of the Guarantees of
all the Subsidiary Guarantors (except as expressly provided in the Guarantee Agreement), without the written consent of each Lender; provided
further that no such agreement shall amend, modify, extend or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any Agent without the prior written
consent of such Agent.
 
(c)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02:
 
(i)            this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended as provided in Sections 1.09, 2.06(d), 2.07(b) and
2.11(b);
 
(ii)            any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered
into by Parent and the Administrative Agent to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency so long as, in each case, the
Lenders shall have received at least five Business Days’ prior written notice thereof and the Administrative Agent shall not have
received, within five Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that the
Required Lenders object to such amendment; and
 
(iii)            no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be required of (x) any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred
to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso in Section 9.02(b) and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be affected by
such amendment, waiver or other modification or (y) in the case of any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in the first
proviso in Section 9.02(b), any Lender that receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by, and
all other amounts owing to, such Lender or accrued for the account of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
at the time such amendment, waiver or other modification becomes effective and whose Commitments terminate by the terms and upon
the effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or other modification.
 
(d)            The Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute
amendments, waivers or other modifications on behalf of such Lender. Any amendment, waiver or other modification effected in accordance with
this Section 9.02 shall be binding upon each Person that is at the time thereof a Lender and each Person that subsequently becomes a Lender.
 
 
81
 
SECTION 9.03.     Expenses; Indemnity; Limitation of Liability. (a)  Parent and the Borrowers shall pay (i) all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents, the Arrangers and their Affiliates (including due diligence expenses, syndication
expenses and reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, US counsel to the Agents and the Arrangers,
Allen & Overy, UK and Australian counsel to the Agents and the Arrangers, and Walkers (Jersey) LLP, Jersey counsel to the Agents and the
Arrangers), in connection with the structuring, arrangement and syndication of the credit facility provided for herein, including the preparation,
execution and delivery of the commitment letter and any fee letter entered into in connection with the credit facility provided for herein, (ii) all
reasonable and documented expenses of the Agents associated with the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (iii) all reasonable and documented expenses incurred by any Agent or any Lender,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any of the foregoing (including Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, US
counsel to the Agents, Allen & Overy, UK and Australian counsel to the Agents, and Walkers (Jersey) LLP, Jersey counsel to the Agents), in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in
connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of
such Loans.
 
(b)            Parent and the Borrowers shall indemnify each Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Arranger, the Syndication
Agents, the Documentation Agents and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
“Indemnitee”), against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all Liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable and
documented fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of (i) the structuring, arrangement and the syndication of the credit facility provided for herein (in the case of any
Arranger), the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the commitment letter or any fee letter entered into in connection with the
credit facility provided for herein, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby, the performance by the parties to the commitment letter or any fee letter entered into in connection with the credit facility provided for
herein, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents of their obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other
transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing (including, with respect to clause (i), any such actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to or arising from the delivery, by or on behalf of any Loan Party, of an executed counterpart of a signature
page of any Loan Document or Ancillary Document that is an Electronic Signature), whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
whether initiated against or by any party to any Loan Document, any Affiliate thereof or any third party (and regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto) or (iv) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Materials on any property currently or formerly
owned or operated by, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided that (x) such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such Liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (i) such Indemnitee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct,
(ii) a material breach by such Indemnitee of the express terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or (iii) claims of one or more
Indemnitees against another Indemnitee (other than claims against any Agent, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents or the
Arrangers in their capacities or in fulfilling their roles as such) and not involving any act or omission of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates and (y) Parent and the Borrowers shall not be liable for the legal fees and expenses of more than one law firm at any time for the
Indemnitees as a whole (and, if reasonably deemed necessary by the Indemnitees, one firm of local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for the
Indemnitees as a whole); provided that, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where any Indemnitee affected by such conflict
informs Parent of such conflict, Parent and the Borrowers shall be responsible for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of one
additional firm of counsel for each group of such affected Indemnitees similarly situated (and if reasonably deemed necessary by such affected
Indemnitee, one additional firm of such local counsel for each group of such affected Indemnitees similarly situated). This paragraph shall not
apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
 
82
 
(c)            To the extent that Parent and the Borrowers fail to indefeasibly pay any amount required to be paid by them under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section to any Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally
agrees to pay to such Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the
time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense
or indemnified Liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent (or such sub-agent) in its capacity
as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for such Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. For
purposes of this Section, a Lender’s “pro rata share” shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures
and Unused Commitments at the time (or most recently outstanding and in effect).
 
(d)            To the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent and the Borrowers shall not assert, and Parent and the Borrowers
hereby waive (and each other Loan Party, by becoming a party to the Guarantee Agreement, shall be deemed to not assert and to waive), any
claim against any Lender-Related Person for any Liabilities arising from the use by others of information or other materials (including, without
limitation, any personal data) obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet
and the Platform), except to the extent that such Liabilities are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable
judgment to have resulted from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Lender-Related Person or the material breach by such Lender-
Related Person of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
 
(e)            To the extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each such party hereby waives (and each
other Loan Party, by becoming a party to the Guarantee Agreement, shall be deemed to not assert and to waive), any Liabilities against any other
party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising
out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that this paragraph shall not limit the obligations of the Loan
Parties under paragraph (b) of this Section or any indemnification or expense reimbursement obligations set forth in any other Loan Document, in
each case, to indemnify and hold harmless any Lender-Related Person against any such Liabilities that may be awarded against it.
 
 
83
 
(f)            Without limitation to the foregoing and without prejudice to the generality of any waiver granted by any Loan Party
in the Loan Documents, each Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally abandons and waives any right that it may have at any time under the
existing or future laws of Jersey, whether by virtue of the droit de discussion or otherwise, (i) to require that recourse be had to the assets of any
other Person before any claim is enforced against any Borrower in respect of the obligations or liabilities assumed by such Borrower under any
document, including any Loan Document, and (ii) to require that any liability under any document, including any Loan Document, be divided or
apportioned with any other Person or reduced in any manner whatsoever.
 
(g)            All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
 
SECTION 9.04.     Successors and Assigns. (a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) neither Parent nor any Borrower may assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Agent and each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by Parent or any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the
extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section), and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the
Documentation Agents, the sub-agents of any Agent and the Related Parties of any of the Agents, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the
Documentation Agents and any Lender) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
 
84
 
(b)            (i)  Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the
time held or owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of:
 
(A)            Parent; provided that no consent of Parent shall be required (1) for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate
of a Lender or an Approved Fund or (2) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, for any other assignment;
provided further that Parent shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written
notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received written notice thereof; and
 
(B)            the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.
 
(ii)            Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
 
(A)            except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or
Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than US$5,000,000 (or (x) in the case of
an assignment solely of Loans denominated in Euros, €5,000,000, and (y) in the case of an assignment solely of Loans
denominated in Sterling, £5,000,000), unless each of Parent and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents; provided that no
such consent of Parent shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided further that Parent shall
be deemed to have consented to any such assignment that would otherwise not comply with the provisions of this
clause (A) unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having
received written notice thereof;
 
(B)            each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s
rights and obligations under this Agreement;
 
(C)            the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Assumption (or an agreement incorporating by reference a form of Assignment and Assumption posted on the Platform),
together with a processing and recordation fee of US$3,500, provided that only one such processing and recordation fee shall
be payable in the event of simultaneous assignments from any Lender or its Approved Funds to one or more other Approved
Funds of such Lender;
 
 
85
 
(D)            the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which
may contain Private Side Information) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the
assignee’s compliance procedures and applicable law, including US Federal and state and foreign securities laws; and
 
(E)            there must be no less than two Lenders or one Lender with its lending office in Australia remaining after
giving effect to such assignment.
 
(iii)            Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(v) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption (or an agreement incorporating by reference a form of Assignment and Assumption posted on
the Platform) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption
covering all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 9.03 and 9.17). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.04(c).
 
(iv)            The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at
one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and records of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
(the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and Parent, the Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Parent and the Borrowers and, as to entries pertaining to
it, any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice; provided that if Parent or any Borrower requests a
copy of the Register, such copy shall be provided to Parent or such Borrower within two Business Days of such request.
 
 
86
 
(v)            Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of an Assignment and Assumption (or an agreement incorporating by
reference a form of Assignment and Assumption posted on the Platform) executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder) and the processing and recordation fee
referred to in this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein
in the Register; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to accept such Assignment and Assumption or so record the
information contained therein if the Administrative Agent reasonably believes that such Assignment and Assumption lacks any written consent
required by this Section or is otherwise not in proper form, it being acknowledged that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation
(and shall incur no liability) with respect to obtaining (or confirming the receipt of) any such written consent or with respect to the form of (or
any defect in) such Assignment and Assumption, any such duty and obligation being solely with the assigning Lender and the assignee. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph, and
following such recording, unless otherwise determined by the Administrative Agent (such determination to be made in the sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent, which determination may be conditioned on the consent of the assigning Lender and the assignee), shall be effective
notwithstanding any defect in the Assignment and Assumption relating thereto. Each assigning Lender and the assignee, by its execution and
delivery of an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have represented to the Administrative Agent that all written consents required by
this Section with respect thereto (other than the consent of the Administrative Agent) have been obtained and that such Assignment and
Assumption is otherwise duly completed and in proper form, and each assignee, by its execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption,
shall be deemed to have represented to the assigning Lender and the Administrative Agent that such assignee is an Eligible Assignee. Upon
request of Parent, the Administrative Agent shall provide to Parent a copy of each Assignment and Assumption and Administrative
Questionnaire that shall have been accepted by the Administrative Agent.
 
(c)            (i)  Any Lender may, without the consent of Parent, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to
one or more Eligible Assignees (“Participants”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or
a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) Parent, the
Borrowers, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent
of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Parent and the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 (subject to the requirements
and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.14(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 2.14(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (x) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.15 and
2.16 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (y) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12
or 2.14, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement
to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that
sells a participation agrees, at Parent’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent to effectuate the provisions of
Section 2.16(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.15(c) as though it were a Lender.
 
(ii)            Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers,
maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant’s interest in the Loans or other rights and obligations of such Lender under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any
information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other rights and obligations under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other right or
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall
be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of
such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, no Agent (in its
capacity as an Agent) shall have any responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
 
87
 
(d)            Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other
central bank with jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
SECTION 9.05.     Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan
Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and
the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agents, the
Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any Loan Document is executed and delivered or any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in
full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement
is outstanding and unpaid (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and yield protection obligations as to which no claim has
been made) and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.04(b), 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15(e), 2.16,
9.03 and 9.17 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 
SECTION 9.06.     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution. (a)  This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken
together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate fee letters with respect to fees payable to
the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof, including the commitments
of the Lenders and, if applicable, their Affiliates under any commitment letter entered in connection herewith (but do not supersede any other
provisions of any such commitment letter or any fee letter entered into in connection with the credit facility provided for herein that do not by the
terms of such documents terminate upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect). This
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall have
received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
 
 
88
 
(b)            Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any
document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice (including any notice delivered pursuant to Section 9.01), certificate, request,
statement, disclosure or authorization related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or the transactions contemplated hereby and/or
thereby (each, an “Ancillary Document”) that is an Electronic Signature transmitted by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that
reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement,
such other Loan Document or such Ancillary Document, as applicable. The words “execution”, “signed”, “signature”, “delivery” and words of
like import in or relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall be deemed to include Electronic
Signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in any electronic form (including deliveries by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means
that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a
manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as
provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State
Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that nothing
herein shall require any Agent to accept Electronic Signatures in any form or format without its prior written consent and pursuant to procedures
approved by it; provided further, without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent any Agent has agreed to accept any Electronic Signature, the
Agents and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of any Loan Party without
further verification thereof and without any obligation to review the appearance or form of any such Electronic Signature and (ii) upon the
request of any Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed counterpart. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Party hereby (A) agrees that, for all purposes, including, without limitation, in connection with any
workout, restructuring, enforcement of remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Agents, the Lenders and the Loan Parties,
Electronic Signatures transmitted by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature
page and/or any electronic images of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document (in each case, including with
respect to any signature pages thereto) shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as any paper original, (B) agrees that each
Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary
Document in the form of an imaged electronic record in any format, which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of such Person’s
business, and destroy the original paper document (and all such electronic records shall be considered an original for all purposes and shall have
the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record), (C) waives any argument, defense or right to contest the legal effect, validity
or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document based solely on the lack of paper original copies
of this Agreement, such other Loan Document and/or such Ancillary Document, respectively, including with respect to any signature
pages thereto and (D) waives any claim against any Lender-Related Person for any Liabilities or expenses of any kind arising solely from any
Agent’s and/or any Lender’s reliance on or use of Electronic Signatures and/or transmissions by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means
that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page, including any Liabilities or expenses of any kind arising as a result of the failure
of any Loan Party to use any available security measures in connection with the execution, delivery or transmission of any Electronic Signature.
 
SECTION 9.07.     Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate
such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
SECTION 9.08.     Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each
Affiliate thereof is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) or other amounts at any time held and other
obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, or by such an Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of Parent or any
Borrower against any of and all the obligations then due of Parent or any Borrower existing under this Agreement held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations of Parent or any
Borrower are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated
on such indebtedness. Each Lender agrees to promptly notify Parent and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application; provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  The rights of each Lender, and each Affiliate
thereof, under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or Affiliate may have.
 
 
89
 
SECTION 9.09.     Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)  This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.
 
(b)            Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York and of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and, subject to the next sentence, each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document brought by it or any of its
Affiliates shall be brought, and shall be heard and determined, exclusively in such Federal court or, in the event such Federal court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, such New York State court. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that any Agent or
any Lender may otherwise have to bring any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
against any Non-US Loan Party or its properties in the courts of in the jurisdiction of organization of such Non-US Loan Party. Each party hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
 
(c)            Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit, action or proceeding in any such court.
 
(d)            Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.
 
(e)            Each Non-US Loan Party hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers Amcor US, with an address of 2801
SW 149 Avenue, Suite 350, Miramar, Florida 33027, and Amcor US hereby accepts such designation, appointment and empowerment, as its
authorized designee, appointee and agent (the “Authorized Agent”) to receive, accept and forward for and on its behalf service of any and all
legal process, summons, notices and documents that may be served in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document. Such service may be made by mailing a copy of such process to any such Loan Party in the care of the Authorized
Agent at its address set forth above, and each Non-US Loan Party hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Authorized Agent to accept such
service on its behalf. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon each such
Loan Party.
 
(f)            In the event any Loan Party or any of its assets has or hereafter acquires, in any jurisdiction in which judicial
proceedings may at any time be commenced with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any immunity from jurisdiction, legal
proceedings, attachment (whether before or after judgment), execution, judgment or setoff, such Loan Party hereby irrevocably agrees not to
claim and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives such immunity.
 
SECTION 9.10.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 9.11.     Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of
reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this
Agreement.
 
SECTION 9.12.     Confidentiality. Each of the Agents and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Related Parties, including accountants, legal counsel and other
agents and advisors, it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential or be subject to customary confidentiality obligations of employment or
professional practice, (b) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority, semi-governmental authority, self-regulatory authority
(such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) or regulatory authority having or purporting to have jurisdiction over it (in which
case such Agent or such Lender shall, (i) except with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any governmental
bank regulatory authority exercising examination or regulatory authority (or any request by such a governmental bank regulatory authority) and
(ii) in the case of any request or demand of any self-regulatory authority, to the extent reasonably practicable, (A) promptly notify Parent of (and,
to the extent reasonably practicable in light of the nature of the request, in advance of) such disclosure to the extent permitted by law and (B) so
furnish only that portion of such information that such Agent or such Lender reasonably believes it is legally required to disclose), (c) in any
legal, judicial or administrative proceeding or other compulsory process or otherwise as required by applicable law or regulations (in which case
such Agent or such Lender shall (i) promptly notify Parent of (and, to the extent reasonably practicable in light of the nature of the request, in
advance of) such disclosure to the extent permitted by law and (ii) so furnish only that portion of such information that such Agent or such
Lender reasonably believes it is legally required to disclose), (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing confidentiality undertakings substantially
similar to those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its Related Parties) to any swap or derivative transaction, or
any actual or prospective credit insurance provider (or its Related Parties), relating to any of Parent or the Borrowers and their obligations
hereunder, (g) with the consent of Parent, (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to any Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than Parent or a Borrower or (i) solely with respect to Information about this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to market data
collectors and service providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending industry. For purposes of this Section, “Information”
means all information received from Parent or any Borrower relating to Parent, any Subsidiary or their businesses, other than any such
information that is available to any Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Parent or any Borrower. Any Person
required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do
so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its
own confidential information.
 
 
91
 
SECTION 9.13.     Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate
applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law
(collectively the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received
or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that
would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the
interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor)
until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the NYFRB Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such
Lender.
 
SECTION 9.14.     “Know Your Customer” Notices. Each Lender and each Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender)
hereby notifies each Loan Party that, pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Terrorism Financing Rules promulgated under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth), it is required to
obtain, verify and record information that identifies such Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and
other information that will allow such Lender or such Agent, as applicable, to identify such Loan Party in accordance with such Act and Rules.
 
SECTION 9.15.     No Fiduciary Relationship. Each of Parent and the Borrowers, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, agrees
that in connection with all aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, Parent, the
Borrowers and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agents, the Arrangers, the Lenders and their Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a
business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of the Agents, the Arrangers, the Lenders or
their Affiliates, and no such duty will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications. The Agents, the
Arrangers, the Lenders and their Affiliates may be engaged, for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in a broad range of transactions
that involve interests that differ from those of Parent, the Borrowers and their Affiliates, and none of the Agents, the Arrangers, the Lenders or
their Affiliates has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to Parent, the Borrowers or any of their Affiliates. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, each of Parent and the Borrowers hereby agrees not to assert any claims that it or any of its Affiliates may have against the
Agents, the Arrangers, the Lenders and their Affiliates with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection
with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.
 
SECTION 9.16.     Non-Public Information. (a)  Each Lender acknowledges that all information, including requests for waivers
and amendments, furnished by Parent, any Borrower or any Agent pursuant to or in connection with, or in the course of administering, this
Agreement, will be syndicate-level information, which may contain Private Side Information. Each Lender represents to Parent, the Borrowers
and the Agents that (i) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of Private Side Information and that it will handle Private Side
Information in accordance with such procedures and applicable law, including Unites States Federal and state and foreign securities laws, and
(ii) it has identified in its Administrative Questionnaire a credit contact who may receive information that may contain Private Side Information
in accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including United States federal and state and foreign securities laws.
 
 
92
 
(b)            Parent, the Borrowers and each Lender acknowledge that, if information furnished by Parent or any Borrower
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is being distributed by any Agent through Debt Domain, IntraLinksTM, SyndTrak or any other
electronic platform chosen by such Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the “Platform”), (i) the Agents may post any information that
Parent has indicated as containing Private Side Information solely on that portion of the Platform as is designated for Private Side Lender
Representatives and (ii) if Parent has not indicated whether any information furnished by it pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement
contains Private Side Information, each Agent reserves the right to post such information solely on that portion of the Platform as is designated
for Private Side Lender Representatives. Parent agrees to clearly designate all information provided to the Agents by or on behalf of Parent or
any Borrower that is suitable to be made available to Public Side Lender Representatives, and each Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
designation by Parent without liability or responsibility for the independent verification thereof. In the event that any Lender has determined for
itself to not access any information disclosed through the Platform or otherwise, such Lender acknowledges that (A) other Lenders may have
availed themselves of such information and (B) none of Parent, any Borrower, any Agent or any other Titled Person has any responsibility for
such Lender’s decision to limit the scope of the information it has obtained in connection with this Agreement.
 
SECTION 9.17.     Conversion of Currencies. (a)  If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to
convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency
could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
 
(b)            The obligations of each of Parent and the Borrowers in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any party to any
other Loan Document or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder or under any other Loan Document (the “Applicable Creditor”) shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder
or under such other Loan Document (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by
the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal
banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement
Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, Parent and such Borrower
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss.
 
SECTION 9.18.     Additional Subsidiary Guarantees; Release of Subsidiary Guarantors. (a)  Parent may (but, except as
provided in Section 5.03, is not required to), at any time upon prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, cause any of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries to become a Subsidiary Guarantor by causing such Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a supplement to
the Guarantee Agreement in the form specified therein, together with, to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, documents and
opinions of the type referred to in Sections 4.01(b), 4.01(c) and 4.01(g) with respect to such Subsidiary.
 
(b)            In the event that (i) all of the capital stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Borrower) that is owned by Parent
and the Subsidiaries is sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction or transactions permitted by Section 6.03, (ii) in the case of any Subsidiary
Guarantor that shall have become such solely pursuant to Section 9.18(a), immediately after giving effect to such release (and assuming that all
of the Financial Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor outstanding on the date of the effectiveness of such release has been incurred by such
Subsidiary Guarantor on such date), all of the Financial Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries shall be permitted under Section 6.03 or (iii) in the case
of any Subsidiary Guarantor that shall have become such pursuant to Section 5.03, such Subsidiary Guarantor (if it were not already a party to the
Guarantee Agreement) would no longer be required, pursuant to Section 5.03, to become a Subsidiary Guarantor, then, in each case, promptly
following Parent’s request and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result after giving effect to such release,
the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender to) execute and deliver to Parent, at Parent’s expense, a
release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement. In connection with any release pursuant to this
Section, the Administrative Agent may request that Parent deliver to it a certificate of a Financial Officer of Parent to the effect that the
requirements to such release set forth in this paragraph have been satisfied, and the Administrative Agent may rely on, and shall incur no liability
for relying upon, any statements made in any such certificate. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this paragraph shall be
without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
 
 
93
 
SECTION 9.19.     Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto
acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured,
may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges
and agrees to be bound by:
 
(a)            the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such
liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
 
(b)            the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 
(i)            a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
 
(ii)            a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected
Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such
shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
 
(iii)            the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion
Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.

debt obligations, Parent and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the
unavailability of Unsecured Ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Rates and

Benchmark Replacement Adjustment. If the Benchmark Replacement determined as set forth above would be less than the Floor, the Benchmark
Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
“Benchmark Replacement Adjustment” means, with respect to any replacement of the then-current Benchmark with an
Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for any applicable Interest Period and Available Tenor for any setting of such Unadjusted Benchmark
Replacement, the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative
value or zero) that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and Parent for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to
(a) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the
replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable
Benchmark Replacement Date and/or (b) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for
calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark
Replacement for syndicated credit facilities denominated in the applicable Agreed Currency at such time in the United States.

decides, after consultation with Parent, may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of such Benchmark and to permit the
administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the Administrative Agent
decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines, in its
reasonable discretion, that no market practice for the administration of such Benchmark exists, in such other manner of administration as the
Administrative Agent reasonably decides, after consultation with Parent, is reasonably necessary in connection with the administration of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents).

after the date hereof in US GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders, by notice to Parent, shall request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is
given before or after such change in US GAAP or in the application thereof, then (i) such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of US GAAP
as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such
provision amended in accordance herewith and (ii) Parent shall provide such statements of reconciliation as are reasonably necessary to enable
calculations of any ratio or amount set forth herein on the basis of US GAAP as in effect and applied before such change shall have become

all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to (i) any election under Accounting Standards

(or similar arrangement conveying the right to use) as a Finance Lease where such lease (or similar arrangement) would not have been required
to be so treated under US GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2017, as a result of the effectiveness of the Financial Accounting Standards Board

Material Acquisition or Material Disposition shall be calculated as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of such period as follows:
(i) historical revenues and other historical income statement items (whether positive or negative) directly attributable to the property or Person
subject to such Material Acquisition or Material Disposition (x) in the case of a Material Acquisition, shall be included (but without giving effect
to any cost savings or synergies) and (y) in the case of a Material Disposition, shall be excluded and (ii) any retirement of Financial Indebtedness
and any Financial Indebtedness incurred or assumed by Parent or any of the Subsidiaries in connection therewith shall be given pro forma effect
as if the same had occurred on the first day of such period (and if any such Financial Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being
given pro forma effect, the interest on such Financial Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been
the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedge Agreement applicable to such indebtedness if such Hedge Agreement has
a remaining term in excess of 12 months)).
 
SECTION 1.06.      Currency Translation. The Administrative Agent shall determine the US Dollar Equivalent of any
Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency on each applicable Exchange Rate Date, in each case using the Exchange Rate for such
Alternative Currency in relation to US Dollars in effect on the date of determination, and such amount shall be the US Dollar Equivalent of such
Borrowing until the next required calculation thereof pursuant to this sentence. The Administrative Agent shall notify Parent and the Lenders of

SECTION 1.08.      Interest Rate; Benchmark Notification. The interest rate on any Loan denominated in US Dollars or an
Alternative Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Upon
the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 2.12(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The
Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration,
submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor
rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including, without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative,
successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing rate being
replaced, or have the same volume or liquidity as any existing interest rate, prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this
Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in
each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable
discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrowers, any Lender or any other Person for damages of any kind,
including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information
source or service.
 
 
38
 
SECTION 1.09.      Most Favored Nation Provision.
 
(a)            In the event that the Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement shall contain any financial covenant, any restrictive
covenant, any event of default, any subsidiary guarantee or any collateral requirement (each, an “MFN Provision”) that is either not set forth in
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or is more restrictive on Parent and the Subsidiaries or otherwise more favorable to the lenders or
other creditors thereunder than the corresponding provisions set forth in this Agreement or such other Loan Document, then this Agreement or
such other Loan Document, as applicable, shall automatically be deemed to have been amended to incorporate such MFN Provision,
mutatis mutandis, as if set forth fully herein or therein, without any further action required on the part of any Person, effective as of the date when
such MFN Provision became effective under the Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. Parent shall execute any and all further documents and
agreements, including amendments hereto, and shall take all such further actions, as shall be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to
give effect to this paragraph. Failure by Parent or any Subsidiary to observe or perform any provision incorporated pursuant to this Section shall
constitute an Event of Default under clause (d) of Article VII, provided that the period of grace (if any) applicable to the failure to observe or
perform the MFN Provision set forth in the Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement shall also apply hereunder.
 
(b)            If, after the time this Agreement is amended pursuant to Section 1.09(a) to include in this Agreement any MFN
Provision (an “Incorporated MFN Provision”) contained in the Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, such Incorporated MFN Provision
ceases to be in effect under, or is deleted from, the Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (including as a result of the termination of the Three-
Year Revolving Credit Agreement upon the repayment in full of all Financial Indebtedness outstanding thereunder and the termination of all
commitments thereunder), or is amended or modified for the purposes of the Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement so as to become less
restrictive with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, then, upon the request of Parent, the Required Lenders will amend this Agreement to
delete or similarly amend or modify, as the case may be, such Incorporated MFN Provision as in effect in this Agreement, provided that no
Default or Event of Default shall be in existence immediately before or after such deletion, amendment or modification. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this Section 1.09(b) as the result of any Incorporated MFN Provision ceasing to be in
effect or being deleted, amended or otherwise modified shall cause any financial covenant, any restrictive covenant, any event of default, any
subsidiary guarantee or any collateral requirement in this Agreement to be less restrictive as to Parent or any Subsidiary than such financial
covenant, restrictive covenant, event of default, subsidiary guarantee or collateral requirement as contained in this Agreement as in effect on the
Effective Date, and as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified thereafter (other than as the result of the application of Section 1.09(a)).
 
SECTION 1.10.      Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division
under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws) (each, a “Division”): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or
liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from
the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been
organized and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.
 
SECTION 1.11.      Blocking Regulations. In relation to any Lender that is incorporated in Germany or otherwise is subject to
the regulations referred to below (each, a “Restricted Lender”), any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein that refers to Sanctions
and/or a Sanctioned Person (each, a “Specified Provision”) shall only apply for the benefit of such Restricted Lender to the extent that such
Specified Provision would not result in (a) a violation of, conflict with or liability under EU Regulation (EC) 2271/96 (or any implementing law
or regulation in any member state of the European Union or any similar applicable blocking or anti-boycott law or regulation in the UK) or (b) a
violation of or conflict with section 7 foreign trade rules (AWV) (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) (in connection with section 4 paragraph 1 no. 3
foreign trade law (AWG) (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz)) or a similar anti-boycott statute (the “Mandatory Restrictions”). In the case of any consent or
direction by Lenders in respect of any Specified Provision of which a Restricted Lender does not have the benefit due to a Mandatory Restriction,
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the definition of Required Lenders, for so long as such Restricted Lender shall be subject to a
Mandatory Restriction, the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Restricted Lender will be disregarded for the purpose of
determining whether the requisite consent of the Lenders has been obtained or direction by the requisite Lenders has been made, it being agreed,
however, that, unless, in connection with any such determination, the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from any Lender
stating that such Lender is a Restricted Lender with respect thereto, each Lender shall be presumed, in connection with such determination, not to
be a Restricted Lender.

make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the
Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required.
 
(b)            Subject to Section 2.12, (i) each Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars shall be comprised entirely of

Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(c)            At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing, such Revolving
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum;
provided that (i) any Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing that results from a continuation of an outstanding Term Benchmark Revolving
Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to such outstanding Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing and (ii) a Term Benchmark
Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments. At the time each ABR

Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments. At the time each
Swingline Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of €1,000,000 and not less than €5,000,000;
provided that a Swingline Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments.
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 10 (or
such greater number as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent) Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowings and RFR Revolving Borrowings
outstanding.
 
 
40
 
 
(d)            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrowers shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to
convert to or continue, any Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the
Maturity Date.
 
SECTION 2.03.      Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a Revolving Borrowing, the applicable Borrower (or Parent
on its behalf) shall notify the Applicable Agent (a) in the case of a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Revolving Borrowing, (b) in the case of an RFR Revolving Borrowing, not later

If no currency is specified with respect to any requested Revolving Borrowing, then the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) shall be

shall be (A) in the case of a Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, an ABR Revolving Borrowing, (B) in the case of a Revolving
Borrowing denominated in Euro, a EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing and (C) in the case of a Revolving Borrowing denominated in Sterling, a

Borrowing, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. Promptly following receipt
of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender of the requested Revolving Borrowing of
the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Revolving Loan to be made as part of the requested Revolving Borrowing.
 
 
41
 
SECTION 2.04.      Swingline Loans. (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to
make Swingline Loans denominated in Euros to each Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount
at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding €60,000,000,
(ii) the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Lender exceeding its Swingline Commitment,
(iii) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding the Aggregate Commitment, (iv) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender

Exposure attributable to Swingline Loans maturing after such Existing Maturity Date exceeding the total Commitments that shall have been
extended to a date after the latest maturity date of such Swingline Loans; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a
Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.
 
(b)            To request a Swingline Borrowing, the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) shall notify the Applicable
Agent of such request not later than 11:00 a.m., London time, on the day of the proposed Swingline Borrowing. Each such request shall be made
by delivery to the Applicable Agent of a written Borrowing Request executed by a Financial Officer of the applicable Borrower (or, if applicable,
of Parent). Each Borrowing Request shall specify, in compliance with Section 2.02, the requested date of such Swingline Borrowing (which shall
be a Business Day), the principal amount of the requested Swingline Borrowing and the location and number of the account of the applicable
Borrower to which funds are to be disbursed, and identifying information with respect to the applicable recipient bank (and any correspondent
bank) (which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Applicable Agent). Promptly following the receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance
with this Section (and in any event not later than 1:00 p.m., London time, on the day of the proposed Swingline Borrowing), the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Swingline Lender of the amount of the Swingline Loan requested to be made. The Swingline Lender shall make each
Swingline Loan by wire transfer of immediately available funds in Euro to the account specified in such Borrowing Request by 3:00 p.m.,
London time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
 
(c)            The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Applicable Agent not later than 12:00 noon, London time,
on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall
specify the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans in which the Lenders will be required to participate. Promptly upon receipt of
such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of
such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay (in Euro), on the first Business Day following
receipt of notice as provided above, to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage
of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that, in making any Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender shall be
entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying, upon the representation and warranty of the Borrowers deemed made pursuant to
Section 4.02, unless, at least one Business Day prior to the time such Swingline Loan was made, the Required Lenders shall have notified the
Swingline Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in writing that, as a result of one or more events or circumstances described in such
notice, one or more of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02(a) or 4.02(b) would not be satisfied if such Swingline Loan were then
made (it being understood and agreed that, in the event the Swingline Lender shall have received any such notice, the Swingline Lender shall not
have any obligation to make any Swingline Loan until and unless the Swingline Lender shall be satisfied that the events and circumstances
described in such notice shall have been cured or otherwise shall have ceased to exist). Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or any reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that
each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its
obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to
Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders pursuant to this
paragraph), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and
thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Applicable Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts
received by the Swingline Lender from a Borrower (or other Person on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by
the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Applicable Agent; any such amounts
received by the Applicable Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Applicable Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments
pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid
to the Swingline Lender or to the Applicable Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to a Borrower for
any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve any
Borrower of its obligation to repay such Swingline Loan.
 
 
42
 
SECTION 2.05.      Funding of Borrowings. (a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed
date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 1:30 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of ABR
Revolving Loans, such later time as shall be two hours after the delivery by or on behalf of the applicable Borrower of a Borrowing Request
therefor in accordance with Section 2.03), to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the
Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans available to the
applicable Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account designated in the applicable Borrowing
Request.
 
(b)            Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing
that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that
such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance on such
assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made
available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such
Lender, (A) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of (x) the NYFRB Rate and (y) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, the greater of (x) the rate reasonably
determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) and (y) a
rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a payment to be made
by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan pursuant to Section 2.11. If any Borrower and such Lender shall pay such
interest to the Applicable Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Applicable Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount
of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Borrower
shall not be required to pay such amount to the Applicable Agent and such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such
Borrowing. Any payment by any Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have
failed to make such payment to the Applicable Agent.

SECTION 2.06.      Interest Elections. (a)  Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and, in the case of a Term
Benchmark Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided
in Section 2.03. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) may elect to convert such Revolving Borrowing (if denominated in
US Dollars) to a Revolving Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Revolving Borrowing and, in the case of a Term Benchmark
Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. A Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) may elect different
options with respect to different portions of an affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among
the Lenders holding the Revolving Loans comprising such Revolving Borrowing and the Revolving Loans resulting from an election made with
respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Revolving Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which
may not be converted or continued. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Borrower shall be permitted to change the currency
of any Revolving Borrowing, to elect a Type for any Revolving Borrowing not available under Section 2.02(b) for the currency in which such
Revolving Borrowing is denominated or to elect an Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing that does not comply with
Section 2.02(d).
 
(b)            To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) shall notify the
Applicable Agent of such election by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting
a Revolving Borrowing of the Type and in the currency resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such
election shall be made by delivery to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request executed by a Financial Officer of the
applicable Borrower (or, if applicable, of Parent). Each Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify the following information
in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i)            the Revolving Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected
with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Revolving Borrowing (in which case the
information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Revolving Borrowing);
 
(ii)            the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)            the Type of the resulting Revolving Borrowing; and
 
(iv)            if the resulting Revolving Borrowing is to be a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing, the Interest Period to be
applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest
Period”.
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the
applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
 
(c)            Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request in accordance with this Section, the Applicable Agent
shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Revolving Borrowing.
 
(d)            If the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a
Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Revolving Borrowing is repaid
as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, (i) in the case of a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars,
such Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing
denominated in Euro, such Revolving Borrowing shall be continued as a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing with an Interest Period of one
month.
 
 
44
 
(e)            Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has
occurred and is continuing with respect to any Borrower, or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative
Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, has notified Parent of the election to give effect to this sentence on account of such other Event of
Default, then, in each such case, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in US
Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Term SOFR Revolving Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Term SOFR Revolving Borrowing shall
be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each Term Benchmark
Revolving Borrowing denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be continued as a Revolving Borrowing of the applicable Type with an Interest
Period of one month’s duration.
 
SECTION 2.07.      Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Increase of Commitments. (a)  Unless previously terminated,
the Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.
 
(b)            Parent may at any time terminate, or from time to time permanently reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 and not less than US$5,000,000 and (ii) Parent
shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans and/or Swingline
Loans in accordance with Section 2.09, (A) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitment or (B) the
Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender would exceed its Commitment.
 
(c)            Parent shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under
paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days (or such shorter period as may be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent)
prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice,
the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by Parent pursuant to this Section shall be
irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section may state that such notice
is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by Parent (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Commitments.
 
 
45
 
(d)            Parent may at any time and from time to time by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly
upon receipt deliver a copy thereof to each of the Lenders) executed by Parent and one or more financial institutions (any such financial
institution being referred to as an “Increasing Lender”), which may include any Lender, cause Commitments of the Increasing Lenders to be
increased (or cause the Increasing Lenders to extend new Commitments) in an amount for each Increasing Lender (which shall not be less than
US$5,000,000) set forth in such notice; provided that (i) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment pursuant to this
paragraph, (ii) after giving effect to any increase in the Commitments pursuant to this paragraph (a “Commitment Increase”), the aggregate
amount of all Commitment Increases established pursuant to this paragraph shall not be greater than US$500,000,000, (iii) each Increasing
Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (iv) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall become a
party to this Agreement by completing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a duly executed accession agreement in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and Parent (an “Accession Agreement”). Upon the effectiveness of any Accession Agreement to which
any Increasing Lender is a party (and the effectiveness of the new Commitment of such Lender in accordance with this paragraph), such
Increasing Lender shall thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded a
Lender hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder. Each Commitment Increase shall become effective on the date specified in
the applicable notice delivered pursuant to this paragraph (which date shall be at least five Business Days (or such shorter period as may be
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) after the date of delivery of such notice); provided that no Commitment Increase shall
become effective unless (A) the Administrative Agent shall have received, with respect to such Commitment Increase, such opinions, documents
and certificates consistent with those delivered under Sections 4.01(b) and 4.01(c) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, (B) on
the effective date of such Commitment Increase, the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in the Loan Documents shall be
true and correct (x) in the case of the representations and warranties qualified as to materiality, in all respects and (y) otherwise, in all material
respects, in each case on and as of the date of such effectiveness, except in the case of any such representation and warranty that expressly relates
to a prior date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct on and as of such prior date (provided that (I) in the
case of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.05(b) and 3.08(a), each reference therein to the Effective Date shall be deemed
to be a reference to the effective date of such Commitment Increase and (II) in the case of the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 3.05(b), the reference therein to June 30, 2021 shall be deemed to be a reference to the date of Parent’s audited Consolidated Financial
Statements most recently delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.01(a)), (C) no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and (D) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of Parent to the
effect that the conditions set forth in clauses (B) and (C) above shall have been satisfied. The Administrative Agent shall notify Parent and the
Lenders of the effective date of each Commitment Increase (the “Increase Effective Date”), and such notice shall be conclusive and binding. On
the Increase Effective Date of any Commitment Increase, (i) the aggregate principal amount of any Revolving Loans outstanding (the “Existing
Borrowings”) immediately prior to such Commitment Increase on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be repaid, (ii) each Increasing
Lender that shall have had a Commitment prior to such Commitment Increase shall pay to the Applicable Agent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in each applicable currency an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable
Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of each Subsequent Borrowing (as
hereinafter defined) and (B) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to such Commitment
Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of each Existing Borrowing, (iii) each Increasing Lender that shall not have had a Commitment prior to
such Commitment Increase shall pay to the Applicable Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds in each applicable currency an
amount equal to the product of (1) such Increasing Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase)
multiplied by (2) the amount of each Subsequent Borrowing, (iv) after the Applicable Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and
(iii) above, the Applicable Agent shall remit (in the applicable currency) to each Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference
(if positive) between (A) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to such Commitment Increase)
multiplied by (2) the amount of each Existing Borrowing, and (B) the product of (1) such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving
effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of each Subsequent Borrowing, (v) after the effectiveness of such Commitment
Increase, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the “Subsequent Borrowings”) in amounts and currencies equal to the
amounts and currencies of the Existing Borrowings and of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to
the Applicable Agent in accordance with Section 2.03, (vi) each Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Subsequent
Borrowing (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) and (vii) the Borrowers shall pay each Lender any and all accrued but
unpaid interest on its Revolving Loans comprising the Existing Borrowings. To the extent the Existing Borrowings include any Term Benchmark
Revolving Borrowings, the deemed payments of such Existing Borrowings made pursuant to clause (i) above shall be subject to compensation by
the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.14 if the Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest
Period(s) relating thereto.
 
 
46
 
SECTION 2.08.      Repayment of Loans; Extension of Maturity Date; Evidence of Debt. (a)  Each Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Applicable Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving
Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower on the Maturity Date (in the case of any Declining Lender, without giving effect to the extension
thereof pursuant to Section 2.08(b)) and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan made to such
Borrower by the Swingline Lender on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the seventh day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on
each date that a Revolving Borrowing denominated in Euros is made, the Borrowers shall repay all Swingline Loans that were outstanding on the
date such Revolving Borrowing was requested.
 
(b)            Parent may, by delivery of a Maturity Date Extension Request to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly
upon receipt deliver a copy thereof to each of the Lenders), request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional period of one
year; provided that (i) Parent shall provide no more than one Maturity Date Extension Request in any 12-month period and (ii) there shall be no
more than two extensions of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section; provided further that no extension may result in the Maturity Date as so
extended being more than five years after the date of effectiveness of such extension. Each Lender shall, by notice to Parent and the
Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day after the date of the Administrative Agent’s receipt of the Maturity Date Extension
Request from Parent, advise Parent whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Lender agreeing to a requested extension being
called a “Consenting Lender”, and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a “Declining Lender”). Any Lender that
has not so advised Parent and the Administrative Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a
Declining Lender. If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have agreed to a Maturity Date Extension Request, then the Maturity Date
shall, as to the Consenting Lenders, be extended to the first anniversary of the Maturity Date theretofore in effect. The decision to agree or
withhold agreement to any Maturity Date Extension Request shall be at the sole discretion of each Lender. The Commitment of any Declining
Lender shall terminate on the Maturity Date in effect prior to giving effect to any such extension (such Maturity Date being called the “Existing
Maturity Date”). The principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Declining Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon and any
accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing
Maturity Date, and on the Existing Maturity Date the Borrowers shall also make such other prepayments of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.09 as
shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, Declining Lenders pursuant to
this sentence, (x) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the Aggregate Commitment and (y) the Revolving Credit Exposure
of any Lender would not exceed its Commitment. Parent shall have the right, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.17(b), at any time
prior to the Existing Maturity Date, to replace a Declining Lender with a Lender or other Eligible Assignee that will agree to the applicable
Maturity Date Extension Request, and any such replacement Lender shall for all purposes constitute a Consenting Lender. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Availability Period and the Maturity Date (without taking into consideration any extension pursuant to this paragraph), as such
terms are used in reference to the Swingline Lender or any Swingline Loans, may not be extended without the prior written consent of the
Swingline Lender (it being understood and agreed that, in the event the Swingline Lender shall not have consented to any such extension, (A) the
Swingline Lender shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of the Swingline Lender hereunder through the Existing Maturity Date (or
the Availability Period determined on the basis thereof, as applicable), and thereafter shall have no obligation to make any Swingline Loan (but
shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.04, 2.13, 2.15, 9.03, 9.09 and 9.17 as to Swingline Loans made prior to such time), and
(B) the principal amount of any outstanding Swingline Loans, together with any accrued interest thereon, shall, to the extent outstanding or
accrued but unpaid on the Existing Maturity Date, be due and payable on the Existing Maturity Date) and (ii) no extension of the Maturity Date
pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless (A) the Administrative Agent shall have received, with respect to such extension, such
opinions, documents and certificates consistent with those delivered under Sections 4.01(b) and 4.01(c) as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request, (B) on the date of effectiveness of such extension, the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in the Loan
Documents shall be true and correct (x) in the case of the representations and warranties qualified as to materiality, in all respects and
(y) otherwise, in all material respects, in each case on and as of such date, except in the case of any such representation and warranty that
expressly relates to a prior date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct on and as of such prior date (provided
that (I) in the case of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.05(b) and 3.08(a), each reference therein to the Effective Date shall
be deemed to be a reference to the date of effectiveness of such extension and (II) in the case of the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 3.05(b), the reference therein to June 30, 2021 shall be deemed to be a reference to the date of Parent’s audited Consolidated Financial
Statements most recently delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.01(a)), (C) on the date of effectiveness of such extension,
no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (D) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate dated the date of
effectiveness of such extension and executed by a Financial Officer of Parent to the effect that the conditions set forth in clauses (B) and
(C) above shall have been satisfied.
 
 
47
 
(c)            Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness
of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal, interest and fees payable
and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(d)            The records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be prima facie evidence of the existence
and amounts of the obligations of the Borrowers in respect of the Loans and interest and fees due or accrued hereunder; provided that the failure
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
Borrowers to pay any amounts due hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(e)            Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, each Borrower
shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and
its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest
thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form
payable to the payee named therein (or, if requested by such payee, to such payee and its registered assigns).
 
SECTION 2.09.      Prepayment of Loans. (a)  The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay
any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section.
 
(b)            If, on any date, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed the Aggregate Commitment, then the
applicable Borrowers shall, (i) if any ABR Revolving Borrowing, RFR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Borrowing is then outstanding, not
later than the next Business Day following receipt of notice of such excess from the Administrative Agent, prepay Borrowings in an aggregate
amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount necessary to eliminate such excess (after giving effect to any other prepayment of Borrowings on
such day) and (B) the amount of such ABR Revolving Borrowings, RFR Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings and (ii) if no ABR
Revolving Borrowing, RFR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Borrowing is then outstanding or such excess is not eliminated after giving effect
to any prepayment of Borrowings made pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), on the last day of each successive Interest Period for any Term
Benchmark Revolving Borrowing occurring after receipt of notice of such excess from the Administrative Agent, prepay Borrowings in an
aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount necessary to eliminate such excess (after giving effect to any other prepayment of
Borrowings on such day) and (2) the amount of the applicable Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on any
date the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed 105% of the Aggregate Commitment, then the Borrowers shall, not later than the
next Business Day following receipt of notice of such excess from the Administrative Agent to Parent, prepay one or more Borrowings in an
aggregate amount equal to the amount necessary to eliminate such excess.
 
 
48
 
(c)            Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the Borrowers shall select the Borrowing
or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section.
 
(d)            The applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline
Borrowing, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed in writing promptly thereafter) of any optional prepayment and any mandatory
prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business
Days before the date of such prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) of this Section, as soon thereafter as practicable),
(ii) in the case of prepayment of an RFR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three RFR Business Days before
the date of prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) of this Section, as soon thereafter as practicable), (iii) in the case of
an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such prepayment (which shall be a Business Day)
and (iv) in the case of a Swingline Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, London time, on the date of such prepayment (which shall be a Business
Day). Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof
to be prepaid; provided that a notice of prepayment of any Borrowing under paragraph (a) of this Section may state that such notice is
conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by Parent (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified date of prepayment) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such
notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Applicable Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial
prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as
provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments
shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.11.
 
SECTION 2.10.      Fees. (a)  Parent agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, in US Dollars, for the account of each Lender a
commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily Unused Commitment (determined as set forth below) of such
Lender during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Commitment fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the 15th day
following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and in the event of the termination in whole of the
Commitment of any Lender, on the date of such termination. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment
fees, the Unused Commitment of a Lender shall be determined solely on the basis of the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lender (and any
Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall not be considered usage of such Lender’s Commitment for purposes of this Section 2.10(a)).
 
 
49
 
(b)            Parent agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times
separately agreed upon between Parent and the Administrative Agent.
 
(c)            All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative
Agent for distribution, in the case of commitment fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
 
SECTION 2.11.      Interest. (a)  The Revolving Loans comprising each ABR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(b)            The Revolving Loans comprising each Term SOFR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted Term
SOFR for the Interest Period in effect for such Revolving Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(c)            The Revolving Loans comprising each EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted EURIBO
Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Revolving Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(d)            The Revolving Loans comprising each RFR Revolving Borrowing and each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at the
applicable Daily Simple RFR plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(e)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any
Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest,
after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of or interest on any Loan, 2% per annum plus
the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% per
annum plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
 
(f)            Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon
termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in
the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the
event of any conversion of any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such
Revolving Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. All interest shall be payable in the currency in which the applicable
Loan is denominated.
 
(g)            All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate and (ii) interest on Revolving Loans
denominated in Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for
the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Adjusted Term SOFR, Adjusted EURIBO
Rate, the Daily Simple RFR and Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Applicable Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.12.      Alternate Rate of Interest. (a)  Subject to Section 2.12(b), if:
 
(i)            the Applicable Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error)
(A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means
do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR, the Term SOFR, the Adjusted EURIBO Rate or the EURIBO Rate, as the case
may be (including because the Relevant Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for Revolving Loans denominated
in the applicable currency for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
the applicable Daily Simple RFR or RFR for the applicable currency; or
 
 
50
 
(ii)            the Applicable Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a
Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing, that the Adjusted Term SOFR or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for
Revolving Loans denominated in the applicable currency and for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of making or maintaining the Revolving Loans included in such Revolving Borrowing for such Interest Period or (B) at
any time, that the applicable Daily Simple RFR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining
(or, in the case of Swingline Loans, participating in) Loans included in such Borrowing;
 
then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof (which may be by telephone) to Parent and the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter
and, until (x) the Applicable Agent notifies Parent and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect
to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with
Section 2.06 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04, as applicable, (A) in the case of Revolving Loans
denominated in US Dollars, any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any
Revolving Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing or an RFR Revolving Borrowing, as applicable, and any Borrowing Request
that requests a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing or an RFR Revolving Borrowing, as applicable, shall instead be deemed to be an Interest
Election Request or a Borrowing Request, as applicable, for (1) an RFR Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars so long as the
Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of Section 2.12(a)(i) or 2.12(a)(ii) or (2) an ABR Revolving Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily
Simple SOFR is also the subject of Section 2.12(a)(i) or 2.12(a)(ii) and (B) in the case of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, any
Interest Election Request that requests the continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing and any
Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing, in each case, for the relevant Benchmark, shall
be ineffective (and no Lender shall be obligated to make a Loan on account thereof). Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan or
RFR Loan in any Agreed Currency is outstanding on the date of Parent’s receipt of the notice from the Applicable Agent referred to in this
Section 2.12(a) with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Revolving Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Applicable
Agent notifies Parent and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark
and (y) the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with Section 2.06 or a new
Borrowing Request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04, as applicable, (A) in the case of Revolving Loans denominated in US Dollars,
(1) any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Revolving Loan, convert to, and shall
constitute, (x) an RFR Revolving Loan denominated in US Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of
Section 2.12(a)(i) or 2.12(a)(ii) or (y) an ABR Revolving Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is also the subject of Section 2.12(a)(i) or
2.12(a)(ii) and (2) any RFR Revolving Loan shall, on such date, convert to, and shall constitute, an ABR Revolving Loan and (B) in the case of
Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, (1) any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
to such Revolving Loan, convert to, and shall constitute, a CBR Loan that bears interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency plus
the CBR Spread; provided that if the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error)
that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency cannot be determined, any such affected Revolving Loan shall be prepaid in full by the
applicable Borrower on the day that Parent receives notice thereof from the Applicable Agent, and (2) any RFR Loan shall convert to, and shall
constitute, a CBR Loan that bears interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that if the
Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the
applicable currency cannot be determined, any such affected Loan shall be prepaid in full by the applicable Borrower on the day that Parent
receives notice thereof from the Applicable Agent.
 
 
51
 
(b)            (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event
and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark,
then such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any
Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is
provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document so long as no Agent has received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising
the Required Lenders.
 
(ii)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent, in
consultation with Parent, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark
Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document.
 
(iii)            The Administrative Agent will promptly notify Parent and the Lenders of (A) any occurrence of a Benchmark
Transition Event, (B) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement
Conforming Changes, (D) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.12(b)(iv) and (E) the
commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by
any Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.12, including any determination with respect to
a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain
from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole
discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly
required pursuant to this Section 2.12.
 
(iv)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in
connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term
SOFR or the EURIBO Rate) and either (x) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that
publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (y) the regulatory
supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any
tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest
Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that
was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (x) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark
(including a Benchmark Replacement) or (y) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be
representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of
“Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
 
 
52
 
(v)            Upon Parent’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the applicable
Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) may revoke any request for borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of a Term Benchmark
Revolving Borrowing or RFR Borrowing, as applicable, to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability
Period, and, failing that, the applicable Borrower (or Parent on its behalf) will be deemed to have converted any request for (A) a Term
Benchmark Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to (1) an RFR Revolving
Borrowing denominated in US Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event
or (2) an ABR Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) any Term
Benchmark Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency or any RFR Borrowing shall be ineffective. Furthermore, if any Term
Benchmark Revolving Loan or RFR Loan, as applicable, that is outstanding on the date of Parent’s receipt of notice of the
commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Loan, then until such time as a
Benchmark Replacement for the applicable currency is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.12(b), (A) in the case of Loans
denominated in US Dollars, (1) any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such
Loan, convert to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Revolving Loan denominated in US Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple
SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) an ABR Revolving Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the
subject of a Benchmark Transition Event and (2) any RFR Revolving Loan shall, on such date, convert to, and shall constitute, an ABR
Revolving Loan and (B) in the case of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, (1) any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan shall,
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, convert to, and shall constitute, a CBR Loan that bears interest at the
Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that if the Applicable Agent determines (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency cannot be
determined, any such affected Loan shall be prepaid in full by the applicable Borrower on the day that Parent receives notice thereof
from the Applicable Agent, and (2) any RFR Loan shall convert to, and shall constitute, a CBR Loan that bears interest at the Central
Bank Rate for the applicable currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that if the Applicable Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable currency cannot be determined, any
such affected Loan shall be prepaid in full by the applicable Borrower on the day that Parent receives notice thereof from the Applicable
Agent. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available
Tenor, the component of Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable,
will not be used in any determination of Alternate Base Rate and such component shall be deemed to be zero.
 
SECTION 2.13.      Increased Costs. (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)            impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted EURIBO Rate);
 
(ii)            impose on any Lender or any applicable offshore interbank market for the applicable currency any other condition,
cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans; or
 
(iii)            subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through
(e) of the definition of “Excluded Taxes” and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments
or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
 
 
53
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or
maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender or other
Recipient (subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section), Parent will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs or expenses
incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)            If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has had the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s
capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment or any Swingline
Commitment of or the Loans made by, or participations in Swingline Loans held by, such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of
such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender (subject to
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section), Parent will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or
such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)            A certificate of a Lender or other Recipient setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender or its holding company or such other Recipient, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, including in
reasonable detail a description of the basis for such claim for compensation and an explanation of how such amount or amounts were determined,
shall be delivered to Parent and shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided that no Lender shall deliver such certificate, and seek
compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, unless such Lender is generally seeking, or intends generally to seek, compensation from
similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such Lender has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so)
with respect to the applicable Change in Law; provided further that such Lender shall not be required to provide on such certificate (i) any
information that would cause such Lender to breach any obligation of confidentiality to any Person or violate any regulatory or internal policy
restrictions or (ii) any confidential or commercially sensitive information relating to such Lender's organizational affairs or financing strategies.
Parent shall pay to such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after
receipt thereof.
 
(d)            Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that Parent shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section for any increased costs or expenses incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that
such Lender notifies Parent of the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions and of such
Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased
costs or expenses or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof.
 
 
54
 
SECTION 2.14.      Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment by any Borrower of any principal of any Term
Benchmark Revolving Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default),
(b) the conversion or continuation of any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
(c) the failure by any Borrower to borrow (other than as a result of the failure of any Lender to fund a Revolving Loan required to be funded by it
hereunder), convert, continue or prepay any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (whether or not such notice may be revoked in accordance with the terms hereof) or (d) the assignment of any Term Benchmark
Revolving Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by Parent pursuant to Section 2.17,
then, in any such event, Parent shall (subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section) compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
(but not for any anticipated profits) attributable to such event, including, to the extent that any of the foregoing Revolving Loans are denominated
in an Alternative Currency, the actual costs and expenses of such Lender attributable to the premature unwinding of any Hedge Agreement
entered into by such Lender in respect to the foreign currency exposure attributable to such Revolving Loan. Parent shall also compensate each
Lender for any loss, cost and expense attributable to any failure by any Borrower to (i) deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a
Term Benchmark Revolving Loan or (ii) borrow or prepay any Swingline Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (whether or not such notice may be revoked in accordance with the terms hereof). A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, including in reasonable detail a description of the basis for
such compensation and a calculation of such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to Parent and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Parent shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof.
 
SECTION 2.15.      Payments Free of Taxes. (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party
under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable
law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any
such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall
timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an
Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding
has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) the applicable
Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(b)            Payment of Other Taxes and VAT. The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes and VAT.
 
(c)            Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental
Authority pursuant to this Section 2.15, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such
payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(d)            Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within
30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to
such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
Parent by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.
 
 
55
 
(e)            Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 30 days
after written demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not
already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so),
(ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant
Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in
connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).
 
(f)            Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect
to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Parent and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by
Parent or the Administrative Agent, such information or properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Parent or the
Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition and subject to
Section 2.15(g), any Lender, if reasonably requested by Parent or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other information or
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Parent or the Administrative Agent as will enable Parent or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other
than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.15(f)(ii)(A), 2.15(f)(ii)(B) and 2.15(f)(ii)(D)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable
judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially
prejudice the legal, tax or commercial position of such Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an applicable Borrower or any other
applicable Loan Party that, in each case, is not a US Person or is not resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes, the
applicable Lender will not be subject to the requirements of this paragraph (f)(i) unless it has received written notice from such Borrower or such
other Loan Party advising it of the availability of an exemption or reduction of withholding Tax under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such
Borrower or such other Loan Party is located and containing all applicable documentation (together, if requested by such Lender, with a certified
English translation thereof) required to be completed by such Lender in order to receive any such exemption or reduction, and such Lender is
reasonably satisfied that it is legally able to provide such documentation to such Borrower or such other Loan Party.
 
(ii)            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is a US Person:
 
(A)            (i) any Lender that is a US Person shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior
to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies (by facsimile or electronic mail (in .pdf or
.tif format)) of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from US backup withholding tax, and (ii) the Applicable
Agent with respect to such Borrower shall deliver to such Borrower on or prior to the date on which such Applicable Agent
becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower), executed
copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Applicable Agent is exempt from US Federal backup withholding Tax;
 
 
56
 
(B)            any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)            in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United
States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-
8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, US withholding Tax
pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any
Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or
reduction of, US Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax
treaty;
 
(2)            executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)            in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign
Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of any of
the Borrowers within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described
in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-
8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or
 
(4)            to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY,
accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other
certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership
and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such
Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of
each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)            any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in US Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the
withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
 
57
 
(D)            if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to US Federal withholding Tax
imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including
those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to such Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower
or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)
(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as
may be necessary for such Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to
determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct
and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to
FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Parent and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(g)            (i)  Each Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax on interest payable by Amcor
UK under any applicable double taxation treaty to which the United Kingdom is a party, and that holds a passport number under the HMRC
Double Taxation Passport scheme and wishes that scheme to apply to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, shall include an indication
to that effect by including its HMRC Double Taxation Passport scheme reference number in such Lender’s Administrative Questionnaire and its
jurisdiction of tax residence (or otherwise provide the scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence to the Administrative Agent
and Parent, for the benefit of Amcor UK) and subject to paragraph (g)(iii) below, having so provided its HMRC Double Taxation Passport
scheme reference number shall be under no further obligation pursuant to Section 2.15(f) in respect of Amcor UK.
 
(ii)            Where a Lender includes the indication described in paragraph (g)(i) above, Amcor UK shall file a duly completed
form DTTP2 with respect to each such Lender with HMRC within 30 days of the date such Lender becomes a Lender hereunder, and shall
promptly provide such Lender with a copy of that filing. No Borrower shall file a form DTTP2 or file any other form relating to the HMRC
Double Tax Passport scheme unless a Lender has provided its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with
paragraph (g)(i) above or such Lender otherwise agrees.
 
(iii)            If a Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with
paragraph (g)(i) above and Amcor UK has not filed a duly completed form DTTP2 in respect of such Lender or Amcor UK has filed a duly
completed DTTP2 in respect of such Lender but (y) the form DTTP2 has been rejected by HMRC or (z) HMRC has not given Amcor UK
authority to make payments to such Lender without withholding or deduction on account of Tax within 60 days of the date Amcor UK filed a
duly completed DTTP2 in respect of such Lender and, in the case of clause (y) or (z), Amcor UK has notified such Lender thereof in writing,
such Lender and Amcor UK shall co-operate in completing any additional procedural formalities necessary for Amcor UK to obtain authorization
to make that payment without any withholding or deduction on account of Tax.
 
 
58
 
(h)            Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has
received a refund of any Taxes (which, for purposes of this Section 2.15, with respect to Taxes which arise in the United Kingdom, shall include a
credit against or relief of any such Taxes) as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.15 (including by the payment of
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made under this Section 2.15 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount
paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the
event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this
paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would
have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require
any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(i)            United Kingdom Taxation. Each of Parent and Amcor UK represents and warrants that it is resident for Tax purposes
only in the United Kingdom. Each of Amcor Australia, Amcor US and Amcor Flexibles represents and warrants that it is not resident for Tax
purposes in the United Kingdom.
 
(j)            Australian Taxation. (i)  Each Arranger represents to Amcor Australia that (A) on behalf of Amcor Australia, it has
made invitations to become a Lender under this Agreement to 10 or more Persons, each of whom, as at the date the relevant invitation was made,
such Arranger’s officers or employees involved in the day to day syndication process reasonably believed was carrying on the business of
providing finance or investing or dealing in securities in the course of operating in financial markets, and (B) such Arranger’s officers or
employees involved in the day to day syndication process reasonably believed 10 or more of such invitees were not Associates of each other or of
Amcor Australia.
 
(ii)            Amcor Australia confirms that none of the potential invitees whose names were disclosed to it by an Arranger before
the date of this Agreement were known or suspected by it to be an Offshore Associate of Amcor Australia. Amcor Australia also confirms that
each Borrower under this Agreement is (A) a member of the same “wholly-owned group” (as defined in the Australian Tax Act) or (B) an
Associate of each other Borrower.
 
(iii)            Each Lender listed in Schedule 2.01 represents and warrants that (A) an invitation to become a Lender under this
Agreement was made to it by the Arrangers on behalf of Amcor Australia, (B) it was at the time of the invitation, and will be at the time of
making by it of any Loan to Amcor Australia, carrying on a business of providing finance, or investing or dealing in securities, in the course of
operating in financial markets and (C) except as disclosed to Amcor Australia, insofar as its officers and agents who were involved in its
becoming a party to this Agreement have actual knowledge, it is not an Associate of any other Person which was invited to become a Lender
under the Agreement.
 
(iv)            At the cost of Amcor Australia, each of the Lenders and the Arrangers will, to the extent it is reasonably able to do
so, do or provide such other things (including information) which Amcor Australia reasonably requests it to do or provide in connection with the
invitations to become Lenders under this Agreement which Amcor Australia considers practicable and necessary to demonstrate that the
requirements of section 128F of the Australian Tax Act are satisfied.
 
(k)            Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.15 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
 
59
 
(l)            VAT. (i)  All amounts set out or expressed in a Loan Document to be payable by any party to any Recipient that (in
whole or in part) constitute the consideration for a supply for VAT purposes shall, except as otherwise agreed by such Recipient, be deemed to be
exclusive of any VAT that is chargeable on such supply. Subject to paragraph (ii) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by
any Recipient to any party under a Loan Document, such party shall pay to such Recipient (in addition to and at the same time as paying any
other consideration for such supply), an amount equal to the amount of such VAT (and such Recipient shall have delivered to such party an
invoice complying with the applicable legal requirements) unless such party is obligated by law to account directly to the applicable
Governmental Authority for such VAT. If there is an adjustment to the consideration in respect of a supply to which this Section 2.15(l)(i) applies,
(A) the additional amount paid or payable to the applicable Recipient must be recalculated, taking into account any previous adjustments under
this clause (A), to reflect the occurrence of such adjustment and the other party or the Recipient, as the case requires, must pay to the other the
amount required to reflect the recalculation of the additional amount, and (B) the Recipient must provide any relevant documentation in respect
of the adjustment (including, if relevant, an adjustment note) to the other party as soon as practicable after the Recipient becomes aware of the
occurrence of such adjustment.
 
(ii)            If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (the “VAT
Supplier”) to any other Lender (the “VAT Recipient”) under a Loan Document, and any party other than the VAT Recipient (the “VAT Relevant
Party”) is required by the terms of any Loan Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the VAT Supplier (rather
than being required to reimburse or indemnify the VAT Recipient in respect of that consideration) (x) (where the VAT Supplier is the Person
required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the VAT Relevant Party shall also pay to the VAT Supplier (at the same time as
paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The VAT Recipient shall (where the immediately foregoing
clause (x) applies) promptly pay to the VAT Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the VAT Recipient receives from the
relevant tax authority which the VAT Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply and (y) (where the VAT
Recipient is the Person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the VAT Relevant Party shall promptly, following demand
from the VAT Recipient, pay to the VAT Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the VAT
Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.
 
(iii)            Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify any Recipient for any cost or expense, such
party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Recipient for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as
represents VAT, except to the extent that such Recipient reasonably determines that it, or any company of its group, is entitled to credit or
repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.
 
(iv)            Any reference in paragraphs (i) through (iii) above to any party shall, at any time when such party is treated as a
member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative
member of such group at such time (the term “representative member” to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994 or
equivalent legislation and the council directive 2006/112/EEC on the common system of value added tax).
 
(v)            In relation to any supply made by a Recipient to any party under a Loan Document, if reasonably requested by such
Recipient, such party must promptly provide such Recipient with details of such party’s VAT registration and such other information as is
reasonably requested in connection with such Recipient’s VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.
 
(m)            Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.15, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.

SECTION 2.16.      Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs. (a)  Each Borrower shall make each payment
required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Documents prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan
Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, then, in the case of payments in US Dollars, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the date when due and, in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, no later than the Applicable Time specified by the
Administrative Agent), in immediately available funds, without any defense, setoff, recoupment or counterclaim. Any amounts received after
such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for
purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent to such account as the Applicable Agent shall
from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to Parent, except that payments required to be made directly to the Swingline Lender
shall be so made, payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments
pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall
be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in
respect of any Loan shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan; all other payments hereunder
and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by any Agent hereunder shall be deemed to
have been made by the time required if such Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in
accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Agent to make such payment.
  
(b)            If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Agents to pay fully all amounts of principal,
interest and fees then due, and expenses then reimbursable, hereunder, such funds shall be applied towards payment of the amounts then so due
or reimbursable as follows:
 
FIRST, to the payment of all fees then due, and all costs and expenses then due or reimbursable, to the Agents (in their capacity
as such) under any Loan Document;
 
SECOND, to the payment of all principal and interest then due in respect of the Swingline Loans then outstanding; and
 
THIRD, to the payment of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents to the Lenders (ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts then due to such parties).
 
(c)            If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the
proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall notify the Administrative Agent and shall
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the amount of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of principal
of and accrued interest on their Revolving Loans and participations in Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased
and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the
extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by Parent
or any other Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including pursuant to Sections 2.08(b) and 2.20)
or any other Loan Document (for the avoidance of doubt, as in effect from time to time) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration
for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in Swingline Loans to any Person that is an Eligible Assignee
(as such term is defined from time to time). Each of Parent and the Borrowers consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against
Parent or such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of
Parent or such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
 
61
 
(d)            Unless an Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to such
Agent for the account of any Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, such Agent may assume that such Borrower has
made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the
amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally agrees to repay to
such Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to such Agent, at (i) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of (A) the NYFRB
Rate and (B) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) if denominated in an
Alternative Currency, the greater of (A) the rate reasonably determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which
determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) and (B) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation.
 
(e)            If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account of any Agent
or the Swingline Lender, then each Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter
received by any Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations in respect of such payment until all such unsatisfied
obligations have been discharged or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future
funding obligations of such Lender pursuant to Sections 2.04(c), 2.05(b), 2.15(e), 2.16(d) and 9.03(c), in each case in such order as shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
 
SECTION 2.17.      Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a)  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under
Section 2.13, (ii) the Loan Parties are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes (other than VAT that is recoverable from any Governmental
Authority) or additional amounts to any Lender or to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 (other
than additional amounts arising from VAT that are recoverable from any Governmental Authority) (or if it becomes reasonably likely that such
compensation or payment will be required to be made) or (iii) any Lender gives notice of illegality pursuant to Section 2.20, then such Lender
shall (at the request of Parent) use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates if, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13
or 2.15 or would permit such Lender to withdraw such notice of illegality, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender
to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Parent hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
 
 
62
 
(b)            If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any Indemnified
Taxes (other than VAT that is recoverable from any Governmental Authority) or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 (other than additional amounts arising from VAT that are recoverable from any
Governmental Authority), (iii) any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, (iv) any Lender is a Declining Lender, (v) any Lender has given
notice of illegality pursuant to Section 2.20 or (vi) any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination
that under Section 9.02 requires the consent of all the Lenders (or all the affected Lenders) and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall
have granted their consent, Parent may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests,
rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.13, 2.15 and 9.03) and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment
and delegation); provided that (A) Parent shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, in circumstances where
its consent would be required under Section 9.04, the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or
conditioned, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and, if applicable,
participations in Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (in the
case of such principal and accrued interest and fees) or Parent (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment and
delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, (D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law, (E) in the
case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the status of such Lender as a Declining Lender, the assignee shall have agreed to the
applicable Maturity Date Extension Request and (F) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the failure to provide a
consent, the assignee shall have given such consent. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto,
as a result of a waiver or consent by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Parent to require such assignment and delegation have
ceased to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an
Assignment and Assumption executed by Parent, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such
assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto.
 
SECTION 2.18.      Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender
becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
 
(a)            commitment fees shall cease to accrue on the Unused Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 2.10(a) for any period during which such Defaulting Lender is a “Defaulting Lender”;
 
(b)            the Commitment and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining
whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan
Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that any
amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise
provided in Section 9.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof;
 
(c)            if any Swingline Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:
 
(i)            the Swingline Exposure (other than any portion thereof with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have
funded its participation as contemplated by Section 2.04(c)) of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting
Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages, but only to the extent that (A) the sum of all Non-Defaulting
Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure (excluding the funded portion thereof referred
to above) does not exceed the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitments and (B) such reallocation does not result in the
Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender exceeding such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment; and
 
 
63
 
(ii)            if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within
one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent prepay the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure
that has not been reallocated as set forth in such clause; and
 
(d)            so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make any Swingline
Loan, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding Swingline Exposure will be fully
covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with clause (c) above, and participating interests in any such
funded Swingline Loan will be allocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(i) above (and such
Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 
In the event that (x) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent shall have occurred following the date hereof and for
so long as such Bankruptcy Event shall continue or (y) the Swingline Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its
obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to
make any Swingline Loan unless the Swingline Lender shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrowers or the applicable Lender
satisfactory to the Swingline Lender to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
 
In the event that the Administrative Agent, Parent and the Swingline Lender each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately
remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect
the inclusion of such Lender’s Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders
and such funded participations in Swingline Loans as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to
hold such Revolving Loans and such funded participation in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, and such Lender shall thereupon cease to
be a Defaulting Lender (but shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fees accrued during the period when it was a Defaulting Lender, and
all amendments, waivers or other modifications effected without its consent in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.02 and this
Section 2.18 during such period shall be binding on it). The rights and remedies against, and with respect to, a Defaulting Lender under this
Section 2.18 are in addition to, and cumulative and not in limitation of, all other rights and remedies that the Administrative Agent, any Lender,
the Swingline Lender or any Borrower may at any time have against, or with respect to, such Defaulting Lender.
 
SECTION 2.19.      Concerning Subsidiary Borrowers. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Parent to serve as its agent
for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including (a) the giving and receipt of notices (including any Borrowing
Request and any Interest Election Request) and (b) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein.
Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that any amendment or other modification to this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be effected
as set forth in Section 9.02, that such Person shall be bound by this Agreement or any other Loan Document (if it is theretofore a party thereto) as
so amended or modified and that no consent of such Person shall be required to effect any such amendment or other modification.
  
 
64
 
SECTION 2.20.      Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted after the Effective Date that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable lending office to make,
maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to any Relevant Rate (or any component thereof) or to determine or charge
interest rates based upon the Relevant Rate (or any component thereof), then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Parent through the
Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans of the applicable Type (or, in the case of Loans denominated
in US Dollars, to convert Loans to such applicable Type) shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or
maintaining ABR Revolving Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base
Rate, the interest rate on such ABR Revolving Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the
Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case, until such Lender notifies the
Administrative Agent and Parent that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which notice such Lender agrees to
give promptly). Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the applicable Borrowers shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from the
relevant Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay all of such Lender’s Loans of the applicable Type or, in the case of Loans
denominated in Dollars, convert all of such Lender’s Loans of such Type to ABR Revolving Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Revolving
Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR
component of the Alternate Base Rate) on, in the case of Term Benchmark Revolving Loans, the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such
Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Revolving Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully
continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans (in which case the Borrower shall not be required to make payments pursuant to Section 2.11
in connection with such payment) and, in the case of RFR Revolving Loans, on the next Interest Payment Date, if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain such RFR Revolving Loans to such date, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such RFR
Revolving Loans to such date (in which case the Borrower shall not be required to make payments pursuant to Section 2.11 in connection with
such payment), (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Term SOFR, the
Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to
the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such affected Lender that it is no longer illegal for
such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term SOFR (which notice such Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
 
ARTICLE III
 
Representations and Warranties
 
Parent, as to itself and the Subsidiaries, and each Borrower, as to itself and its subsidiaries, represents and warrants to the
Lenders, as of the Effective Date and thereafter as of each date on which representations and warranties are required to be, or are deemed to be,
made under the Loan Documents, that:
 
SECTION 3.01.      Organization, Existence and Good Standing; Powers. Each Loan Party is duly formed, incorporated or
organized, as applicable, validly existing and (to the extent the concept is applicable in such jurisdiction) in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation, incorporation or organization, as applicable, has all power and authority and all material Governmental Approvals
required for the ownership and operation of its properties and the conduct of its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business, and is in
good standing (to the extent the concept is applicable in such jurisdiction), in every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
 
 
65
 
SECTION 3.02.      Corporate and Governmental Authorization. The Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party are
within such Loan Party’s corporate or other organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
organizational and, if required, stockholder or other equityholder action of each Loan Party. The Transactions do not require any consent or
approval of, or any registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made
and are in full force and effect.
 
SECTION 3.03.      Enforceability of Obligations. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and each
Borrower, and this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and each Borrower, and each other Loan Document to
which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Loan Party, in each case, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law.
 
SECTION 3.04.      No Contravention or Exceeding Power. The Transactions (a) do not and will not violate any material law,
including any order of any Governmental Authority, applicable to or binding upon any Loan Party or any of its properties, (b) do not and will not
violate the charter, by-laws, constitutional documents or other organizational documents of any Loan Party, or any limitations on its powers or the
powers of its directors or other governing or managing body, (c) do not and will not violate or result (alone or with notice or lapse of time, or
both) in a default under (i)  the Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement or the Existing Note Documents or (ii) any other indenture or credit
agreement or any other agreement or instrument binding upon Parent or any Subsidiary or any of their assets, except, in the case of this
clause (ii), to the extent that any such default, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and (d) do not and will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or any Subsidiary. No Loan Party
organized under the laws of Australia has contravened or will contravene part 2J.3 of the Corporations Act in connection with its execution,
delivery or performance of any Loan Document.
 
SECTION 3.05.      Financial Statements; No Material Adverse Change. (a)  Parent has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
Consolidated Financial Statements (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, audited by and accompanied by the opinion of
PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, independent registered public accounting firm, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarters and the portion of the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Such Consolidated Financial Statements, and all subsequent Consolidated Financial
Statements provided by Parent pursuant to Section 5.01, have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP and present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby on a consolidated basis in accordance with US GAAP, in the case of
clause (ii) above, subject to the absence of certain footnotes and normal year-end audit adjustments. As of December 31, 2021, neither Parent nor
any Subsidiary had any material actual or contingent liabilities except as disclosed or reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the
fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
 
(b)            There has been, as of the Effective Date, no event or condition since June 30, 2021, that has had, or would

SECTION 3.06.      Accuracy of Disclosure. (a)  Neither the Confidential Materials nor any of the other reports, financial
statements, certificates or other written information furnished by or on behalf of Parent or any Subsidiary to any Agent, any Arranger or any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or furnished hereunder or thereunder, nor any
information formally presented prior to the Effective Date to any Agent, any Arranger or any Lender in bank meetings or conference calls in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (in each case, other than information of a general economic or
industry nature), taken as a whole, contained, as of the date when furnished or presented, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state, as of the date when furnished or presented, a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not materially
misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made; provided that, with respect to projected financial information,
Parent and the Borrowers represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed by management of
Parent to be reasonable at the time such projected financial information was prepared (it being understood that such projected financial
information is subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond control of Parent and the Subsidiaries, that no
assurance can be given that such projected financial information will be realized, and that such projected financial information may differ
materially from actual future results). As of the Effective Date, Parent and the Borrowers have disclosed to the Lenders all agreements,
instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which Parent or any Subsidiary is subject, and all other matters relating to Parent and the
Subsidiaries known to the Borrowers, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b)            If a Beneficial Ownership Certification is required to be delivered pursuant to any Loan Document, then, as of the
date of the delivery thereof, the information set forth in such Beneficial Ownership Certification is true and correct in all respects.
 
SECTION 3.07.      Properties. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its
property, except where the failure to have such title or leasehold interests, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
SECTION 3.08.      Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a)  There are (in the case of clause (i) below, as of the Effective
Date) no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Parent or
the Borrowers, threatened against or affecting Parent or any Subsidiary (i) that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or (iii) to wind up or dissolve (or effect any analogous or similar
action) Parent, any Borrower or any other Subsidiary and that, in the case of any such other Subsidiary, would reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b)            Except with respect to any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, none of Parent or any Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or
comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) currently expects to be required to incur any
capital or other cost for its respective operations to achieve or maintain compliance with any Environmental Law relating to greenhouse gas
emissions or reductions thereto, (iii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iv) has received notice of any claim with respect to any
Environmental Liability or (v) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.
 
SECTION 3.09.      Compliance with Laws and Agreements. (a)  Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
laws, including all orders of Governmental Authorities, applicable to it or its property, except where the failure to comply, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and the Subsidiaries is in compliance, in all
material respects, with Anti-Corruption Laws.
 
 
67
 
(b)            Parent and each Subsidiary (in each case, to the extent a party thereto) is in compliance with the Existing Note
Documents, the Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, all other indentures and credit agreements to which it is a party and all other
agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.
  
SECTION 3.10.      Investment Company Status. None of Parent or any other Loan Party is an “investment company” as
defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
SECTION 3.11.      ERISA. No ERISA Events have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur that would, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The excess of the present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under each
Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715) over the fair value of the assets of such Plan,
as of the date of the most recent Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting such amounts, did not, and could not reasonably be expected to,
result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, (i) each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or may rely upon an
opinion letter for a prototype plan letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter is currently being processed by the IRS with respect
thereto, and (ii) as of the date of this Agreement, to Parent’s knowledge, nothing has occurred which would reasonably be expected to prevent, or
cause the loss of, such qualification.
 
SECTION 3.12.      Ranking of Obligations. The obligations of each Loan Party under the Loan Documents to which it is a
party rank at least equally with all of the unsecured and unsubordinated Financial Indebtedness of such Loan Party, except liabilities mandatorily
(and not consensually) preferred by law, and ahead of all subordinated indebtedness, if any, of such Loan Party.
 
SECTION 3.13.      Related Parties. No Loan Party subject to the Corporations Act has contravened or will contravene
section 208 or section 209 of the Corporations Act by executing and delivering any Loan Document or performing its obligations thereunder or
participating in any transaction in connection with any Loan Document.
 
SECTION 3.14.      Benefit from Transactions. Each Loan Party benefits by the execution, delivery and performance of the
Loan Documents to which it is a party.
 
SECTION 3.15.      Execution not as a Trustee. No Loan Party has executed or delivered any Loan Document in the capacity of
a trustee, responsible entity or custodian of any trust, managed investment scheme or settlement.
 
SECTION 3.16.      Federal Reserve Regulations. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary is engaged or will engage, principally or as
one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of
Governors), or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock. No part of the proceeds of the Loans will be used,
directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation (including on the part of any Lender) of any of the regulations of the Board of
Governors, including Regulations U and X. Not more than 25% of the value of the assets subject to any restrictions on the sale, pledge or other
disposition of assets under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement between Parent or any Subsidiary and any Lender
or Affiliate of a Lender will at any time be represented by margin stock.
 
 
68
 
SECTION 3.17.      Anti-Corruption Laws; Sanctions; FATF Public Statement Jurisdiction. Parent has implemented and
maintains in effect policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by Parent, the Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions, and Parent, the Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers and employees and, to the knowledge of Parent, its and the Subsidiaries’ respective directors and agents, are in compliance with Anti-
Corruption Laws in all material respects and are in compliance with applicable Sanctions. None of Parent, any Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of
Parent or the Borrowers, any of their respective directors, officers or employees, or their respective agents that will act in any capacity in
connection with or benefit from the credit facility established hereby, is a Sanctioned Person. No Borrowing, use of proceeds or other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will violate Anti-Corruption Laws or applicable Sanctions. None of Parent, any Borrower or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or any director, officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, is a Person that is, or is owned or controlled
by Persons that are, located, organized or resident in a FATF Public Statement Jurisdiction.
  
SECTION 3.18.      Choice of Law Provisions. The choice of law provisions set forth in Section 9.09 are legal, valid and
binding under the laws of Australia, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the United Kingdom and each other jurisdiction in which any Non-US Loan Party is
organized, and none of Parent or the Borrowers knows of any reason why the courts of Australia, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the United Kingdom or
any such other jurisdiction will not give effect to the choice of law of the State of New York as the proper law, other than through the exercise by
any such court of discretionary powers under general principles of equity or public policy limitations in each case not specifically relating to such
provisions. Amcor Australia has the legal capacity to sue and be sued in its own name under the laws of Australia, Parent has the legal capacity to
sue and be sued in its own names under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Amcor UK has the legal capacity to sue and be sued in its own name
under the laws of the United Kingdom and each other Non-US Loan Party has the legal capacity to sue and be sued in its own name under the
laws of its jurisdiction of formation, incorporation or organization, as applicable. Each of the Non-US Loan Parties has the power to submit, and
has irrevocably submitted, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of
the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and such irrevocable submission
and the waiver by each Non-US Loan Party of any immunity and any objection to the venue of the proceedings in such Federal or State court are
legal, valid and binding obligations of such Non-US Loan Party, and none of Parent or the Borrowers knows of any reason why the courts of
Australia, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction where any Non-US Loan Party is organized would not give
effect to such submission and waivers, other than through the exercise by any such court of discretionary powers under general principles of
equity or based on public policy limitations in each case not specifically relating to such submission and waivers. Each Non-US Loan Party has
validly and irrevocably appointed the Authorized Agent as its authorized agent for the purpose described in Section 9.09(e). Service of process in
the manner set forth in Section 9.09(d) will be effective to confer valid personal jurisdiction over each Non-US Loan Party, and none of Parent or
the Borrowers knows of any reason why the courts in Australia, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction where any
Non-US Loan Party is organized will not recognize as valid and final, or will not enforce, any final and conclusive judgment against Parent,
Amcor Australia, Amcor UK or such other Non-US Loan Party, respectively, obtained in any such Federal or State court arising out of or in
relation to the obligations of Parent, Amcor Australia, Amcor UK or such other Non-US Loan Party under the Loan Documents, other than
through the exercise by any such court of discretionary powers under general principles of equity or public policy limitations in each case not
specifically relating to jurisdictional matters (including consent to service of process provisions).
 
SECTION 3.19.      No Immunity. Each Non-US Loan Party is subject to civil and commercial laws with respect to its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, and the execution, delivery and performance by such Non-
US Loan Party of this Agreement and any other Loan Documents to which it is a party constitute and will constitute private and commercial acts
and not public or governmental acts. None of the Non-US Loan Parties or any of their properties has any immunity from jurisdiction of any court
or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or
otherwise) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Non-US Loan Party is organized and existing in respect of its obligations under this
Agreement and any other Loan Documents to which it is a party.
 
 
69
 
SECTION 3.20.      Proper Form; No Recordation. With respect to each Non-US Loan Party, this Agreement and each other
Loan Document to which it is a party are in proper legal form under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Non-US Loan Party is organized
and existing for the enforcement thereof against such Non-US Loan Party under the laws of such jurisdiction and to ensure the legality, validity,
enforceability, priority or admissibility in evidence of this Agreement and such other Loan Documents. It is not necessary, in order to ensure the
legality, validity, enforceability, priority or admissibility in evidence of this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which any Non-US Loan
Party is party, that this Agreement or such other Loan Document be filed, registered or recorded with, or executed or notarized before, any court
or other Governmental Authority in the jurisdiction in which such Non-US Loan Party is organized and existing or that any registration charge or
stamp or similar tax be paid on or in respect of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document, except for (a) any such filing, registration,
recording, execution or notarization as has been made or is not required to be made until the applicable Loan Document is sought to be enforced
and (b) any charge or tax as has been timely paid by such Non-US Loan Party.

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated

counsel) that, notwithstanding the confidentiality requirements of Section 9.12, Parent would be prohibited from disclosing by
applicable law or regulations without making public disclosure thereof.

against or affecting Parent or any Subsidiary, or any adverse development in any such pending action, suit or proceeding not previously
disclosed in writing by Parent to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that in each case would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or that in any manner questions the validity of any Loan Document;
 
 
73
 
(c)            any change to any Unsecured Rating;
  
(d)            the occurrence of any ERISA Event that, alone or together with any other ERISA Events that have occurred, would

specified therein, on behalf of such Person, together with, to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, documents and opinions of the
type referred to in Sections 4.01(b) and 4.01(c) with respect to such Subsidiary Guarantor; provided that this Section 5.03 shall not apply to that

time, and to the benefit of any Guarantees provided solely as part thereof.
  
SECTION 5.04.      Existence; Conduct of Business. (a)  Each of Parent and the Borrowers will do or cause to be done all
things reasonably necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect (i) its legal existence (and shall not change the jurisdiction of its
formation, incorporation or organization, as applicable, from that applicable on the date hereof) and (ii) the rights, licenses, permits, privileges,
franchises, patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names necessary or desirable in the normal conduct of its business, except, in the case of
this clause (ii), to the extent that the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect; provided that clause (ii) above shall not prohibit any transaction permitted under Section 6.03.
  
(b)            Parent shall cause each of the Borrowers to be a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

Jurisdiction or any Person located, organized or resident in a FATF Public Statement Jurisdiction or owned or controlled by such Person.
 
SECTION 5.10.      Ranking of Obligations. Each Loan Party shall take all such actions as shall be necessary to ensure that the
Obligations of such Loan Party rank and, until the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated and the principal of and interest on each
Loan and all fees payable hereunder shall have been paid in full, will rank, at least equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations of such Loan Party, except obligations mandatorily (and not consensually) preferred by applicable law, and ahead of all subordinated

last day of at least two subsequent consecutive fiscal quarters.

ARTICLE VIII
 
The Agents
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent and the Foreign Administrative Agent as its agents
and authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Foreign Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as
are delegated to the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Administrative Agent, as applicable, by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with
such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender exempts the Agents from the restrictions pursuant to Section 181 Civil
Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) and similar restrictions applicable to it pursuant to any other applicable law, in each case to the extent legally
possible for such Lender. Any Lender that cannot grant such exemption shall notify the Administrative Agent accordingly and, upon request of
the Administrative Agent, either act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or any other Loan Document as required pursuant to this
Agreement and/or such other Loan Document or grant a special power of attorney to a party acting on its behalf, in a manner that is not
prohibited pursuant to Section 181 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) and/or any other applicable laws. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, each of the Loan Documents to
which such Agent is a party, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies that such Agent may have under such Loan Documents.
 
Any Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with Parent or
any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
 
79
 
No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and in performing its
functions and duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, each Agent is acting solely on behalf of the Lenders (except in limited
circumstances expressly provided for herein relating to the maintenance of the Register), and its functions and duties are entirely mechanical and
administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agents do not assume, and shall not be deemed to have
assumed, any obligation or duty or any other relationship as the agent, fiduciary or trustee of or for any Lender or any other Person, other than as
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood
and agreed that the use of the term “agent” (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with reference to the Administrative
Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary duty or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law,
and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
contracting parties), and each Lender agrees that it will not assert any claim against any Agent based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by
such Agent in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) the Agents
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or to exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated by the Loan Documents that an Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as
provided in the Loan Documents), provided that an Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose such Agent to
liability or be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Agents shall
not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Parent, any Subsidiary or any other
Affiliate of Parent that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Neither any
Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary,
under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents) or (ii) unless a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by a final and
non-appealable judgment that such Agent was grossly negligent or acted with willful misconduct in taking or not taking any such action. Each
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof (stating that it is a “notice of default”) is
given to such Agent by Parent or a Lender, and the Agents shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (A) any
statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (B) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (C) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (D) the sufficiency, value, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with
any Agent’s reliance on any Electronic Signature transmitted by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an
actual executed signature page), (E) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to
confirm receipt of items (which on their face purport to be such items) expressly required to be delivered to such Agent or satisfaction of any
condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to an Agent or (F) any determination with respect
to (1) the existence or the extent of any legal impediments on the ability of any Subsidiary Guarantor or Parent to perform its obligations under
the Guarantee Agreement (it being acknowledged by the Lenders that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to make any evaluation as to
whether any such impediment exists unless and until it shall have been requested to do so in writing by a Lender and, in connection with any
such evaluation or determination, may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Parent) selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel) or (2) the terms of the subordination referred to in the
definition of the term the Subordinated Debt Allowance. Each Agent shall be deemed to have no knowledge of any Lender being a Restricted
Lender unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received the written notice from such Lender referred to in Section 1.11, and then
only to as and to the extent specified in such notice, and any determination of whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders shall
have provided any consent or direction in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not be affected by any subsequent
delivery to the Administrative Agent of any such written notice. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Agent shall be liable for, or
be responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by any Loan Party or any Lender as a result of, any such determination of the Revolving
Credit Exposure or the component amounts thereof or of the US Dollar Equivalent. Each Lender agrees that nothing in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall require any Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any
of its functions or duties under the Loan Documents or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for
believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
 
80
 
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for acting or not acting upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or
other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not
such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof). Each Agent
also shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for acting or not acting upon, any statement made to it orally or by telephone
and believed by it to be made by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan Documents
for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof), and may act upon any such statement prior to receipt of written confirmation thereof,
including pursuant to Section 9.01(e). In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, the Administrative
Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to each Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary
from such Lender sufficiently in advance of the making of such Loan. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
Parent), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with
the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may treat the payee of any promissory note as its holder until such
promissory note has been assigned in accordance with Section 9.04 and may rely on the Register to the extent set forth in Section 9.04(c).
 
Each Agent may perform any of and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan
Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any of and all
their duties and exercise their rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to
any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the credit facility provided for herein as well as activities as an Agent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that
such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
 
 
81
 
Subject to the terms of this paragraph, each Agent may resign at any time from its capacity as such. In connection with such
resignation, such Agent shall give notice of its intent to resign to the Lenders and Parent. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the
Required Lenders (in the case of a resignation by the Administrative Agent) or the Administrative Agent (in the case of a resignation by the
Foreign Administrative Agent) shall have the right (with, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, in the case of a successor to the
Administrative Agent, or with an office in London or Frankfurt, in the case of a successor to the Foreign Administrative Agent or, in each case,
an Affiliate of any such bank. If any Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to Parent and such Agent remove such Agent in its capacity as such, and (with, so
long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned)) appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent or Foreign Administrative Agent, as
applicable, hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring or removed Agent, as the case may be, and such retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by Parent to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed by Parent and such successor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (a) no successor Agent to a retiring Agent
shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intent to resign,
the retiring Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders and Parent or (b) no successor to a removed Agent shall
have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment by the day that is 30 days following of the issuance of a notice of removal, the
removal shall become effective on such 30th day, and on the date of effectiveness of such resignation or removal, as the case may be, (i) the
retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (ii) the
Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent; provided
that (A) all payments required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the retiring or removed Agent for the account of any
Person other than such Agent shall be made directly to such Person and (B) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be
given or made to the retiring or removed Agent shall also directly be given or made to the other Agent and each Lender. After any Agent’s
resignation or removal from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and
indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as an
Agent. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Foreign Administrative Agent under the penultimate paragraph of this
Article.
 
Each Lender represents and warrants that (a) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility, (b) it is
engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and in providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender,
in each case, in the ordinary course of business, and not for the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument
(and each Lender agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing), (c) it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents,
any other Titled Person or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold
Loans hereunder and (d) it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities
set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire
and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or
providing such other facilities. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, any other Titled
Person or any other Lender, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information (which may
contain Private Side Information) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement on the Effective Date, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and
Assumption, the Accession Agreement or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to
have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be
approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on or prior to the date of such document.
 
 
82
 
Each Lender, by becoming a party to this Agreement, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and
approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, any Agent or the
Lenders on or prior to the Effective Date.
 
Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if any Agent notifies such Lender that such Agent has determined in its sole discretion that
any funds received by such Lender from such Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal,
interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively, a “Payment”) were erroneously transmitted to such Lender (whether or not known to
such Lender), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business
Day thereafter, return to such Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day
funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such
Lender to the date such amount is repaid to such Agent at (a) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of (i) the NYFRB Rate and (ii) a rate
determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (b) if denominated in an Alternative
Currency, the greater of (i) the rate reasonably determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which determination will be
conclusive absent manifest error) and (ii) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation,
and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to such Agent, any claim, counterclaim,
defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by such Agent for the return of any Payments
received, including without limitation any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. A notice of any Agent to any Lender
under this paragraph shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from any Agent or
any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by such Agent (or
any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a “Payment Notice”) or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it
shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment. Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if
it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Applicable Agent
of such occurrence and, upon demand from such Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to such
Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest
thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such
amount is repaid to such Agent at (a) if denominated in US Dollars, the greater of (i) the NYFRB Rate and (ii) a rate determined by such Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (b) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, the greater of (i) the rate
reasonably determined by such Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error)
and (ii) a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Parent and the Borrowers hereby
agree (and each other Loan Party, by becoming a party to the Guarantee Agreement shall be deemed to have agreed) that (x) in the event an
erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) are not recovered from any Lender that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the
Agents shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay,
repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party. Each party’s obligations under this
paragraph shall survive the resignation or replacement of any Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender,
the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under any Loan Document.

In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, each Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due
and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether such Agent shall have made any demand on any
Borrower or other Loan Party) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans that
are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and
the Agents (including any claim under Sections 2.10, 2.11, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Lender to make such payments to any Agent and, in the event that any Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Lenders, to pay to such Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03);
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Agents to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf
of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the obligations or the rights of any Lender, or to vote
in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents or the Documentation Agents
(each of the foregoing, a “Titled Person”) shall have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except in its
capacity, as applicable, as a Lender), but all such Persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder, and, without limiting
the foregoing, no Titled Person shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or with Parent or any of its Affiliates.
 
Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from
the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, each Agent and
each Titled Person and their respective Affiliates and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower or any other Loan
Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
 
(a)           such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more
Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the
Commitments or this Agreement,
 
(b)           the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions
involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company
pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE
96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s
entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement,
 
 
84
 
(c)           (i) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of
Part VI of PTE 84-14), (ii) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter
into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, (iii) the entrance into, participation in,
administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-
sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (iv) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of
Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the
Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, or
 
(d)           such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in
its sole discretion, and such Lender.
 
In addition, unless either (1) clause (a) in the immediately preceding paragraph is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender
has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with clause (d) in the immediately preceding paragraph, such Lender
further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person
became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and each
Titled Person and their respective Affiliates and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower or any other Loan Party,
that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in,
administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise
of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).
 
The Foreign Administrative Agent (the “Designating Foreign Administrative Agent”) may at any time and from time to time,
by written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Parent, nominate an Affiliate of the Designating Foreign Administrative Agent
(such Affiliate, a “Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent”) to act as a successor Foreign Administrative Agent. A notice to nominate a
Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent must be in the form of Exhibit G (the “Foreign Administrative Agent Designation Notice”) and be
countersigned by the Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent confirming it will be bound as the Foreign Administrative Agent under this
Agreement. Such Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the Foreign
Administrative Agent, and the term “Foreign Administrative Agent” shall mean such Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent effective
immediately upon delivery of such Foreign Administrative Agent Designation Notice to the Administrative Agent. With respect to
Section 9.01(a)(ii), the address for notices for the Foreign Administrative Agent shall be, upon such succession and without further action, the
address for the Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent set forth in the Foreign Administrative Agent Designation Notice. A Substitute Foreign
Administrative Agent will be treated as the Foreign Administrative Agent for all purposes under the Loan Documents for so long as it continues
to be a Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent under this Agreement. The Designating Foreign Administrative Agent may revoke its
designation of an Affiliate as a Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent by notice in writing to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
Parent.  Upon such Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent’s ceasing to be a Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent, the Designating Foreign
Administrative Agent will automatically assume (and be deemed to assume without further action by any party) all rights and obligations
previously vested in such Substitute Foreign Administrative Agent.
 
The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and, except solely to the extent of
Parent’s rights to consent pursuant to and subject to the conditions set forth in this Article, none of Parent or any other Loan Party shall have any
rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions.

designating a Financial Officer or other authorized employee of the applicable Borrower (or of Parent on its behalf) as authorized to confirm and

(f)           The Borrowers agree that any Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make any Communication by posting such
Communication on the Platform. The Platform and any Communications are provided “as is” and “as available”. The Agents, the Titled Persons
and their respective Related Parties do not warrant, and shall not be deemed to warrant, the adequacy of the Platform or the Communications, and
expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any
warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects,
is made, or shall be deemed to be made, by any Agent, any Titled Person or any of their respective Related Parties in connection with the
Communications or the Platform. In no event shall any Agent, any Titled Person or any of their respective Related Parties have any liability, on
any theory of liability, to any Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person for Liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or

the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Person acted with gross negligence or
willful misconduct; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent, any Titled Person or any of their respective Related Parties have any
liability, on any theory of liability, to any Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages). Parent, each Borrower and each Lender agrees that any Agent or any Titled Person may, but shall not be
obligated to, store any Communications on the Platform in accordance with its customary document retention procedures and policies.
  
SECTION 9.02.       Waivers; Amendments. (a)  No failure or delay by any Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or
consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this
Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver
of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Arranger, any Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
 
 
87
 
(b)            Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section, none of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements
in writing entered into by Parent, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders and, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to
an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in
each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender, or change
the currency in which Loans are available thereunder, without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or
reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, or change the currency of any Loan or any interest or fee, without the
written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled maturity date of any Loan or any date for the payment of any
interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of
any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.16(b) or 2.16(c) in a manner that would
alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this
Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of the term “Required Lenders” or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender or (vi) release (including by limiting liability in respect thereof) (A) any Borrower or
Parent from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement or (B) one or more Subsidiary Guarantors (other than those that are also Borrowers)
from their Guarantees under the Guarantee Agreement if such Guarantees represent a material portion of the aggregate value of the Guarantees of
all the Subsidiary Guarantors (except as expressly provided in the Guarantee Agreement), without the written consent of each Lender; provided
further that no such agreement shall amend, modify, extend or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any Agent or the Swingline Lender
without the prior written consent of such Agent or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.
 
(c)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02:
 
(i)             this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended as provided in Sections 1.09, 2.07(d), 2.08(b) and
2.12(b);
 
(ii)            any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered
into by Parent and the Administrative Agent to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency so long as, in each case, the
Lenders shall have received at least five Business Days’ prior written notice thereof and the Administrative Agent shall not have
received, within five Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that the
Required Lenders object to such amendment; and
 
(iii)           no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be required of (x) any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred
to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso in Section 9.02(b) and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be affected by
such amendment, waiver or other modification or (y) in the case of any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in the first
proviso in Section 9.02(b), any Lender that receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by, and
all other amounts owing to, such Lender or accrued for the account of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
at the time such amendment, waiver or other modification becomes effective and whose Commitments terminate by the terms and upon
the effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or other modification.
 
 
88
 
(d)            The Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute
amendments, waivers or other modifications on behalf of such Lender. Any amendment, waiver or other modification effected in accordance with
this Section 9.02 shall be binding upon each Person that is at the time thereof a Lender and each Person that subsequently becomes a Lender.
 
SECTION 9.03.      Expenses; Indemnity; Limitation of Liability. (a)  Parent and the Borrowers shall pay (i) all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents, the Arrangers and their Affiliates (including due diligence expenses, syndication

Allen & Overy, UK and Australian counsel to the Agents and the Arrangers, and Walkers (Jersey) LLP, Jersey counsel to the Agents and the
Arrangers), in connection with the structuring, arrangement and syndication of the credit facility provided for herein, including the preparation,
execution and delivery of the commitment letter and any fee letter entered into in connection with the credit facility provided for herein, (ii) all
reasonable and documented expenses of the Agents associated with the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (iii) all reasonable and documented expenses incurred by any Agent or any Lender
(including the Swingline Lender), including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any of the foregoing (including
Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, US counsel to the Agents, Allen & Overy, UK and Australian counsel to the Agents, and Walkers (Jersey) LLP,
Jersey counsel to the Agents), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its
rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring
or negotiations in respect of such Loans.
 
(b)            Parent and the Borrowers shall indemnify each Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Arranger, the Syndication
Agents, the Documentation Agents and each Lender (including the Swingline Lender), and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons
(each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”), against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all Liabilities and related expenses,
including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the structuring, arrangement and the syndication of the credit facility provided
for herein (in the case of any Arranger), the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the commitment letter or any fee letter entered
into in connection with the credit facility provided for herein, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties to the commitment letter or any fee letter entered into in connection with the
credit facility provided for herein, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents of their obligations thereunder or the consummation of the
Transactions or any other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or prospective
claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing (including, with respect to clause (i), any such actual or prospective
claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to or arising from the delivery, by or on behalf of any Loan Party, of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of any Loan Document or Ancillary Document that is an Electronic Signature), whether based on contract, tort or
any other theory and whether initiated against or by any party to any Loan Document, any Affiliate thereof or any third party (and regardless of
whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto) or (iv) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Materials on any property currently or
formerly owned or operated by, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided that
(x) such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such Liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (i) such Indemnitee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct,
(ii) a material breach by such Indemnitee of the express terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or (iii) claims of one or more
Indemnitees against another Indemnitee (other than claims against any Agent, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents or the
Arrangers in their capacities or in fulfilling their roles as such) and not involving any act or omission of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates and (y) Parent and the Borrowers shall not be liable for the legal fees and expenses of more than one law firm at any time for the
Indemnitees as a whole (and, if reasonably deemed necessary by the Indemnitees, one firm of local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for the
Indemnitees as a whole); provided that, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where any Indemnitee affected by such conflict
informs Parent of such conflict, Parent and the Borrowers shall be responsible for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of one
additional firm of counsel for each group of such affected Indemnitees similarly situated (and if reasonably deemed necessary by such affected
Indemnitee, one additional firm of such local counsel for each group of such affected Indemnitees similarly situated). This paragraph shall not
apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
 
89
 
(c)            To the extent that Parent and the Borrowers fail to indefeasibly pay any amount required to be paid by them under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section to any Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Swingline Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing,
each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Swingline Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such
Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified Liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against such Agent (or such sub-agent) or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing
acting for such Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the Swingline Lender in connection with such capacity. For purposes of this Section, a Lender’s
“pro rata share” shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures and Unused Commitments at the
time (or most recently outstanding and in effect); provided that, for purposes of this paragraph, the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender that
is the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to exclude any amount of its Swingline Exposure in excess of its Applicable Percentage of all
outstanding Swingline Loans, adjusted to give effect to any reallocation under Section 2.18 of the Swingline Exposures of Defaulting Lenders in
effect at such time, and the Unused Commitment of such Lender shall be determined on the basis of its Revolving Credit Exposure excluding
such excess amount.
 
(d)            To the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent and the Borrowers shall not assert, and Parent and the Borrowers
hereby waive (and each other Loan Party, by becoming a party to the Guarantee Agreement, shall be deemed to not assert and to waive), any
claim against any Lender-Related Person for any Liabilities arising from the use by others of information or other materials (including, without
limitation, any personal data) obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet
and the Platform), except to the extent that such Liabilities are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable
judgment to have resulted from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Lender-Related Person or the material breach by such Lender-
Related Person of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
  
(e)            To the extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each such party hereby waives (and each
other Loan Party, by becoming a party to the Guarantee Agreement, shall be deemed to not assert and to waive), any Liabilities against any other
party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising
out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that this paragraph shall not limit the obligations of the Loan
Parties under paragraph (b) of this Section or any indemnification or expense reimbursement obligations set forth in any other Loan Document, in
each case, to indemnify and hold harmless any Lender-Related Person against any such Liabilities that may be awarded against it.
 
 
90
 
(f)            Without limitation to the foregoing and without prejudice to the generality of any waiver granted by any Loan Party
in the Loan Documents, each Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally abandons and waives any right that it may have at any time under the
existing or future laws of Jersey, whether by virtue of the droit de discussion or otherwise, (i) to require that recourse be had to the assets of any
other Person before any claim is enforced against any Borrower in respect of the obligations or liabilities assumed by such Borrower under any
document, including any Loan Document, and (ii) to require that any liability under any document, including any Loan Document, be divided or
apportioned with any other Person or reduced in any manner whatsoever.
 
(g)            All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
 
SECTION 9.04.       Successors and Assigns. (a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) neither Parent nor any Borrower may
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Agent and each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by Parent or any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants
(to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section), and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents,
the Documentation Agents, the sub-agents of any Agent and the Related Parties of any of the Agents, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the
Documentation Agents and any Lender) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)            (i)  Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the
time held or owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of:
 
(A)            Parent; provided that no consent of Parent shall be required (1) for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate
of a Lender or an Approved Fund or (2) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, for any other assignment;
provided further that Parent shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written
notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received written notice thereof;
  
(B)            the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and
 
(C)            the Swingline Lender.
 
 
91
 
(ii)            Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
 
(A)            except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the
Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than US$5,000,000 (or
(x) in the case of an assignment solely of Loans denominated in Euros, €5,000,000, and (y) in the case of an assignment solely
of Loans denominated in Sterling, £5,000,000), unless each of Parent and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents;
provided that no such consent of Parent shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided
further that Parent shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment that would otherwise not comply with the
provisions of this clause (A) unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business
Days after having received written notice thereof;
 
(B)            each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s
rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided that this clause (B) shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;
 
(C)            the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Assumption (or an agreement incorporating by reference a form of Assignment and Assumption posted on the Platform),
together with a processing and recordation fee of US$3,500, provided that only one such processing and recordation fee shall
be payable in the event of simultaneous assignments from any Lender or its Approved Funds to one or more other Approved
Funds of such Lender;
 
(D)            the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which
may contain Private Side Information) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the
assignee’s compliance procedures and applicable law, including US Federal and state and foreign securities laws; and
 
(E)            there must be no less than two Lenders or one Lender with its lending office in Australia remaining after
giving effect to such assignment.
 
(iii)            Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(v) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption (or an agreement incorporating by reference a form of Assignment and Assumption posted on
the Platform) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption
covering all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 9.03 and 9.17). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.04(c).
 
(iv)            The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at
one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and records of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
(the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and Parent, the Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Parent and the Borrowers and, as to entries pertaining to
it, any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice; provided that if Parent or any Borrower requests a
copy of the Register, such copy shall be provided to Parent or such Borrower within two Business Days of such request.
 
 
92
 
(v)            Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of an Assignment and Assumption (or an agreement incorporating by
reference a form of Assignment and Assumption posted on the Platform) executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder) and the processing and recordation fee
referred to in this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein
in the Register; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to accept such Assignment and Assumption or so record the
information contained therein if the Administrative Agent reasonably believes that such Assignment and Assumption lacks any written consent
required by this Section or is otherwise not in proper form, it being acknowledged that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation
(and shall incur no liability) with respect to obtaining (or confirming the receipt of) any such written consent or with respect to the form of (or
any defect in) such Assignment and Assumption, any such duty and obligation being solely with the assigning Lender and the assignee. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph, and
following such recording, unless otherwise determined by the Administrative Agent (such determination to be made in the sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent, which determination may be conditioned on the consent of the assigning Lender and the assignee), shall be effective
notwithstanding any defect in the Assignment and Assumption relating thereto. Each assigning Lender and the assignee, by its execution and
delivery of an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have represented to the Administrative Agent that all written consents required by
this Section with respect thereto (other than the consent of the Administrative Agent) have been obtained and that such Assignment and
Assumption is otherwise duly completed and in proper form, and each assignee, by its execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption,
shall be deemed to have represented to the assigning Lender and the Administrative Agent that such assignee is an Eligible Assignee. Upon
request of Parent, the Administrative Agent shall provide to Parent a copy of each Assignment and Assumption and Administrative
Questionnaire that shall have been accepted by the Administrative Agent.
 
(c)            (i)  Any Lender may, without the consent of Parent, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to
one or more Eligible Assignees (“Participants”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or
a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) Parent, the
Borrowers, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent
of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Parent and the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 (subject to the requirements
and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.15(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 2.15(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (x) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.16 and
2.17 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (y) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13
or 2.15, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement
to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that
sells a participation agrees, at Parent’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent to effectuate the provisions of
Section 2.17(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(c) as though it were a Lender.
 
 
93
 
(ii)            Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers,
maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant’s interest in the Loans or other rights and obligations of such Lender under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any
information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other rights and obligations under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other right or
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall
be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of
such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, no Agent (in its
capacity as an Agent) shall have any responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(d)            Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other
central bank with jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
SECTION 9.05.      Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan
Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and
the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agents, the
Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any Loan Document is executed and delivered or any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in
full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement
is outstanding and unpaid (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and yield protection obligations as to which no claim has
been made) and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.05(b), 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.16(e), 2.17,
9.03 and 9.17 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 
SECTION 9.06.      Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution. (a)  This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken
together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate fee letters with respect to fees payable to
the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof, including the commitments
of the Lenders and, if applicable, their Affiliates under any commitment letter entered in connection herewith (but do not supersede any other
provisions of any such commitment letter or any fee letter entered into in connection with the credit facility provided for herein that do not by the
terms of such documents terminate upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect). This
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall have
received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
 
 
94
 
(b)            Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any
document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice (including any notice delivered pursuant to Section 9.01), certificate, request,
statement, disclosure or authorization related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or the transactions contemplated hereby and/or
thereby (each, an “Ancillary Document”) that is an Electronic Signature transmitted by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that
reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement,
such other Loan Document or such Ancillary Document, as applicable. The words “execution”, “signed”, “signature”, “delivery” and words of
like import in or relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall be deemed to include Electronic
Signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in any electronic form (including deliveries by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means
that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a
manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as
provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State
Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that nothing
herein shall require any Agent to accept Electronic Signatures in any form or format without its prior written consent and pursuant to procedures
approved by it; provided further, without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent any Agent has agreed to accept any Electronic Signature, the
Agents and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of any Loan Party without
further verification thereof and without any obligation to review the appearance or form of any such Electronic Signature and (ii) upon the
request of any Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed counterpart. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Party hereby (A) agrees that, for all purposes, including, without limitation, in connection with any
workout, restructuring, enforcement of remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Agents, the Lenders and the Loan Parties,
Electronic Signatures transmitted by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature
page and/or any electronic images of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document (in each case, including with
respect to any signature pages thereto) shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as any paper original, (B) agrees that each
Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary
Document in the form of an imaged electronic record in any format, which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of such Person’s
business, and destroy the original paper document (and all such electronic records shall be considered an original for all purposes and shall have
the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record), (C) waives any argument, defense or right to contest the legal effect, validity
or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document based solely on the lack of paper original copies
of this Agreement, such other Loan Document and/or such Ancillary Document, respectively, including with respect to any signature
pages thereto and (D) waives any claim against any Lender-Related Person for any Liabilities or expenses of any kind arising solely from any
Agent’s and/or any Lender’s reliance on or use of Electronic Signatures and/or transmissions by fax, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means
that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page, including any Liabilities or expenses of any kind arising as a result of the failure
of any Loan Party to use any available security measures in connection with the execution, delivery or transmission of any Electronic Signature.
 
 
95
 
SECTION 9.07.      Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
SECTION 9.08.      Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each
Affiliate thereof is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) or other amounts at any time held and other
obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, or by such an Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of Parent or any
Borrower against any of and all the obligations then due of Parent or any Borrower existing under this Agreement held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations of Parent or any
Borrower are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated
on such indebtedness. Each Lender agrees to promptly notify Parent and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application; provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  The rights of each Lender, and each Affiliate
thereof, under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or Affiliate may have.
 
SECTION 9.09.      Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)  This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.
 
(b)            Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the jurisdiction of the

County, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and, subject to the next sentence, each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document brought by it or any of its
Affiliates shall be brought, and shall be heard and determined, exclusively in such Federal court or, in the event such Federal court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, such New York State court. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that any Agent or
any Lender may otherwise have to bring any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
against any Non-US Loan Party or its properties in the courts of in the jurisdiction of organization of such Non-US Loan Party. Each party hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
 
(c)            Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit, action or proceeding in any such court.
 
(d)            Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.
 
(e)            Each Non-US Loan Party hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers Amcor US, with an address of 2801

authorized designee, appointee and agent (the “Authorized Agent”) to receive, accept and forward for and on its behalf service of any and all

or any other Loan Document. Such service may be made by mailing a copy of such process to any such Loan Party in the care of the Authorized
Agent at its address set forth above, and each Non-US Loan Party hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Authorized Agent to accept such
service on its behalf. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon each such
Loan Party.
 
 
96
 
(f)            In the event any Loan Party or any of its assets has or hereafter acquires, in any jurisdiction in which judicial
proceedings may at any time be commenced with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any immunity from jurisdiction, legal
proceedings, attachment (whether before or after judgment), execution, judgment or setoff, such Loan Party hereby irrevocably agrees not to
claim and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives such immunity.
 
SECTION 9.10.      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN

THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Related Parties, including accountants, legal counsel and other
agents and advisors, it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such

legal, judicial or administrative proceeding or other compulsory process or otherwise as required by applicable law or regulations (in which case

similar to those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its Related Parties) to any swap or derivative transaction, or
any actual or prospective credit insurance provider (or its Related Parties), relating to any of Parent or the Borrowers and their obligations

this Section or (ii) becomes available to any Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than Parent or a Borrower or (i) solely with respect to Information about this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to market data
collectors and service providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending industry. For purposes of this Section, “Information”

so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its
own confidential information.
 
 
97
 
SECTION 9.13.      Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate
applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law
(collectively the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received
or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that
would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the
interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor)
until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the NYFRB Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such
Lender.
 
SECTION 9.14.      “Know Your Customer” Notices. Each Lender and each Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender)
hereby notifies each Loan Party that, pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Terrorism Financing Rules promulgated under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth), it is required to
obtain, verify and record information that identifies such Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and
other information that will allow such Lender or such Agent, as applicable, to identify such Loan Party in accordance with such Act and Rules.
 
SECTION 9.15.      No Fiduciary Relationship. Each of Parent and the Borrowers, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, agrees
that in connection with all aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, Parent, the
Borrowers and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agents, the Arrangers, the Lenders and their Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a
business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of the Agents, the Arrangers, the Lenders or
their Affiliates, and no such duty will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications. The Agents, the
Arrangers, the Lenders and their Affiliates may be engaged, for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in a broad range of transactions
that involve interests that differ from those of Parent, the Borrowers and their Affiliates, and none of the Agents, the Arrangers, the Lenders or
their Affiliates has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to Parent, the Borrowers or any of their Affiliates. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, each of Parent and the Borrowers hereby agrees not to assert any claims that it or any of its Affiliates may have against the
Agents, the Arrangers, the Lenders and their Affiliates with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection
with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.
 
 
98
 
SECTION 9.16.      Non-Public Information. (a)  Each Lender acknowledges that all information, including requests for
waivers and amendments, furnished by Parent, any Borrower or any Agent pursuant to or in connection with, or in the course of administering,
this Agreement, will be syndicate-level information, which may contain Private Side Information. Each Lender represents to Parent, the
Borrowers and the Agents that (i) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of Private Side Information and that it will handle
Private Side Information in accordance with such procedures and applicable law, including Unites States Federal and state and foreign securities
laws, and (ii) it has identified in its Administrative Questionnaire a credit contact who may receive information that may contain Private Side
Information in accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including United States federal and state and foreign securities
laws.
 
(b)            Parent, the Borrowers and each Lender acknowledge that, if information furnished by Parent or any Borrower
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is being distributed by any Agent through Debt Domain, IntraLinksTM, SyndTrak or any other
electronic platform chosen by such Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the “Platform”), (i) the Agents may post any information that
Parent has indicated as containing Private Side Information solely on that portion of the Platform as is designated for Private Side Lender
Representatives and (ii) if Parent has not indicated whether any information furnished by it pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement
contains Private Side Information, each Agent reserves the right to post such information solely on that portion of the Platform as is designated
for Private Side Lender Representatives. Parent agrees to clearly designate all information provided to the Agents by or on behalf of Parent or
any Borrower that is suitable to be made available to Public Side Lender Representatives, and each Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
designation by Parent without liability or responsibility for the independent verification thereof. In the event that any Lender has determined for
itself to not access any information disclosed through the Platform or otherwise, such Lender acknowledges that (A) other Lenders may have
availed themselves of such information and (B) none of Parent, any Borrower, any Agent or any other Titled Person has any responsibility for
such Lender’s decision to limit the scope of the information it has obtained in connection with this Agreement.
 
SECTION 9.17.      Conversion of Currencies. (a)  If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to
convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency
could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
 
(b)            The obligations of each of Parent and the Borrowers in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any party to
any other Loan Document or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder or under any other Loan Document (the “Applicable Creditor”) shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder
or under such other Loan Document (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by
the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal
banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement
Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, Parent and such Borrower
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss.

SECTION 9.18.      Additional Subsidiary Guarantees; Release of Subsidiary Guarantors. (a)  Parent may (but, except as
provided in Section 5.03, is not required to), at any time upon prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, cause any of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries to become a Subsidiary Guarantor by causing such Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a supplement to
the Guarantee Agreement in the form specified therein, together with, to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, documents and
opinions of the type referred to in Sections 4.01(b), 4.01(c) and 4.01(g) with respect to such Subsidiary.
 
(b)            In the event that (i) all of the capital stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Borrower) that is owned by Parent
and the Subsidiaries is sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction or transactions permitted by Section 6.03, (ii) in the case of any Subsidiary
Guarantor that shall have become such solely pursuant to Section 9.18(a), immediately after giving effect to such release (and assuming that all
of the Financial Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor outstanding on the date of the effectiveness of such release has been incurred by such
Subsidiary Guarantor on such date), all of the Financial Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries shall be permitted under Section 6.03 or (iii) in the case
of any Subsidiary Guarantor that shall have become such pursuant to Section 5.03, such Subsidiary Guarantor (if it were not already a party to the
Guarantee Agreement) would no longer be required, pursuant to Section 5.03, to become a Subsidiary Guarantor, then, in each case, promptly
following Parent’s request and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result after giving effect to such release,
the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender to) execute and deliver to Parent, at Parent’s expense, a
release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement. In connection with any release pursuant to this
Section, the Administrative Agent may request that Parent deliver to it a certificate of a Financial Officer of Parent to the effect that the
requirements to such release set forth in this paragraph have been satisfied, and the Administrative Agent may rely on, and shall incur no liability
for relying upon, any statements made in any such certificate. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this paragraph shall be
without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 9.19.      Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto
acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured,
may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges
and agrees to be bound by:
 
(a)           the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such
liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
 
(b)            the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 
(i)            a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
 
(ii)           a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected
Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such
shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
 
(iii)          the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers
of the applicable Resolution Authority.
