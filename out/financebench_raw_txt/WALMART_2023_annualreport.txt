Walmart Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help 
people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both 
retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings.  Through innovation, we strive to continuously 
improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering 
that saves time for our customers.  Each week, we serve approximately 240 million customers who visit more than 10,500 
stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 20 countries.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, 
and make trust a competitive advantage.  Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, 
which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time.  
By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and 
services at everyday low prices ("EDLP").  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every 
day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is 
our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Our fiscal year ends 
on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a 
one-month lag and on a calendar year basis.  Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 
2023"), January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022") and January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021").  During fiscal 2023, we generated total revenues 
of $611.3 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $605.9 billion.
We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under 
the symbol "WMT."
The Development of Our Company
The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store 
in Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our 
founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, 
we opened our first supercenter.  In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market.  In 1991, we began our first 
international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2023, our Walmart International 
segment conducted business in 19 countries.
In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com.  Since then, our 
eCommerce presence has continued to grow.  In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store 
service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores.  To date, we now have over 8,100 
pickup and approximately 7,000 delivery locations globally.  In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and 
eCommerce innovation, which has enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and 
expand our assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives, such as with our 
acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), which is our ecosystem in India that includes 
eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra, as well as with our majority stake in PhonePe Private Limited ("PhonePe"), a 
digital transaction platform.
We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and 
marketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2023 to better 
serve our customers.  Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where 
customers view Walmart as their primary destination.  In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service 
offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members.  As we execute on our 
strategy globally, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart 
Fulfillment Services, providing access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health and Flipkart Health+, and our 
financial services businesses.  These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our flywheel centered around our 
customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.

Infor
mation About Our Segments
We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., 
Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.  We also previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of 
Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to Note 12  t
o our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures.  Our 
operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are further 
described below.  Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently.  However, each has generally 
maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution 
rate for the Walmart International segment due to the exit of certain markets and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  
Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in Note 13  t
o our Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
Walmart U.S. Segment
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. 
Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart" and "Walmart Neighborhood 
Market" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands.  Walmart U.S. had net sales of $420.6 billion for fiscal 
2023, representing 69% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $393.2 billion and $370.0 billion for 
fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a 
percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate").  In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the 
Company's net sales and operating income. 
Omni-channel.  W
almart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, 
through services such as pickup and delivery, in-home delivery, ship-from-store, and digital pharmacy fulfillment options.  As 
of January 31, 2023, we had more tha n 4,600 pi
ckup locations and more than 3,900 sa
me-day delivery locations.  Our 
Walmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits including unlimited free shipping on 
eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, access to Paramount+ streaming service, 
and mobile scan & go for a streamlined in-store shopping experience.  We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of 
which is walmart.com.  We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number of 
methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores, as well as certain other business 
offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business.  The following table

Merchandise . Wa
lmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:
• Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli & bakery, 
frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet 
supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;
• General merchandise includes:
◦Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and 
books);
◦Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);
◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and
◦ Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home 
furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).
• Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other 
clinical services.
Other categories in the Walmart U.S. business include an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and 
fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and newer initiatives such as B2B last 
mile delivery services via Walmart GoLocal, and a suite of data products for merchants and suppliers via Walmart Luminate.  
Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores 
and our fintech venture, ONE), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain 
types of installment lending.  
7
Bra
nd name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S.  We also market lines of 
merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: "Allswell," "Athletic Works," "Eloquii Elements," "Equate," 
"Free Assembly," "Freshness Guaranteed," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hyper Tough," "Mainstays," 
"Marketside," "No Boundaries," "onn.," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice," "Sam's Choice," "Scoop," "Spring Valley," "Time 
and Tru," "Way to Celebrate" and "Wonder Nation."  The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, 
some of which include: "Avia," "Love & Sports," "Better Homes & Gardens," "Pioneer Woman" and "Sofia Jeans by Sofia 
Vergara."
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units.  When 
revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.
Operations.   W
almart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well 
as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day.  Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop 
technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, 
Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. 
Seasonal Aspects of Operations.  W
almart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national 
and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal 
quarter ending January 31.  
Competition.  W
almart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, 
department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and 
supercenter-type stores, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment 
and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly 
evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition.  Some 
of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition.  They may be 
able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of 
these businesses.  In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better 
able to innovate and compete with us.
Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely 
determines our competitive position within the retail industry.  We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which 
we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store 
amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital 
platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or 
through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.  We employ many strategies and programs 
designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry.  These strategies include the following:
• EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our 
prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;
• EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our 
customers;
• Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance 
convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and 
• Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment 
services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet 
expanding needs.
Distribution . We
 continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 163 distribution facilities which are 
located strategically throughout the U.S.  For fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were 
shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from 
suppliers.  General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; 
however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise.  We ship 
merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including 
from our 34 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more 
than 3,900 st
ores.

Wal
mart International Segment
Walmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 19 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2023.  
Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes 
Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia), and our majority-owned 
subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras 
and Nicaragua). Walmart International previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 
and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to 
Note 12  t
o our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.
Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale.  These categories 
consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and 
cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, walmart.cn and other sites.  Walmart 
International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 17% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had 
net sales of $101.0 billion and $121.4 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The gross profit rate is lower than that of 
Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix. 
Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant 
and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates.  We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate 
and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth.  As such, we have taken 
certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following 
highlights over the last three years: 
• Divested of Walmart Argentina in November 2020. 
• Divested of Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021. 
• Divested of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.
• Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited 
operations in certain countries in Africa in December 2022.
• Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital transaction platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in 
December 2022.
Omni-channel.  W
almart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and 
eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets and our marketplaces such as Flipkart in 
India.  Our financial services offerings continue to expand with our digital transaction platform anchored in payments at 
PhonePe in India.  We have expanded our marketplace in Mexico and Canada, which unlocks fulfillment and advertising 
services, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia continue to drive ecommerce growth.  
Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet.  Our wholesale stores' selling 
areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet.  As of January 31, 2023, Walmart International 
had over 2,900 pickup and approximately 2,500 delivery locations.
Merchandise.  T
he merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of 
the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we 
have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, 
low priced items.  Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday 
Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands 
including "Aurrera," "Lider," and "PhonePe."  In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with 
regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at 
low prices.
Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as 
advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, healthcare and financial services.  Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for 
example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform 
that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and 
advertising.  In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service allowing customers to enjoy digital 
connectivity, and in India we launched Flipkart Health+ enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country.  
Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.
Operations.  T
he hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets 
within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, 
Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats 
operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.

Se
asonal Aspects of Operations.  W
almart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, its highest sales 
volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different 
national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.
Competition . W
almart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate 
department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale 
clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce 
retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial 
services.  Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel 
experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry.  We believe price leadership is a critical part 
of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach.  Additionally, our ability 
to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.  
Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-
funded competitors continue to intensify this competition.  Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of 
business, more customers, and greater brand recognition.  They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and 
business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses.  In addition, for eCommerce and other 
internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.
Distribution.  W
e utilize a total of 188 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico 
and South Africa.  Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating 
units of the Walmart International segment.  During fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed 
through these distribution facilities.  Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in 
the various markets in which we operate.  Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and 
distribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live.  We ship merchandise 
purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 100 
dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 3,600 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as 
well as our physical retail stores.
Sam's Club Segment
Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.  Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also 
operates samsclub.com.  Sam's Club had net sales of $84.3 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 14% of our consolidated fiscal 
2023 net sales, and had net sales of $73.6 billion and $63.9 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  As a membership-
only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  Sam's Club operates 
with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.
Membership.  T
he following two options are available to members:
Plu
s Membership Club Membership
Annual Membership Fee $110 $50
Number of Add-on Memberships ($45 each) Up to 16 Up to 8
Al
l memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost.  Plus Members are also eligible for free shipping on the 
majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses.  Beginning in fiscal 
2023, Sam's Club launched a single loyalty rewards currency called Sam's Cash which merges and replaces existing Cash 
Rewards for Plus members and Cash Back for Sam's Club Mastercard holders.  Members may redeem Sam's Cash on purchases 
in the club and online, to pay for membership fees or for cash in clubs.  Sam's Cash does not expire and is available for monthly 
redemption.  
Omni-channel.  Sa
m's Club provides an omni-channel experience to members, integrating warehouse clubs and eCommerce 
through such services as Curbside Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, ship-from-club, and delivery-from-club.  Members have access 
to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, including those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through 
our mobile commerce applications.  The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with 
an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet.  
Merchandise.  Sa
m's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:
•Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic 
and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, 
laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items;
• Fuel, tobacco and other categories;

e and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power

• Technology, office and entertainment includes consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office 
supplies, appliances, and third-party gift cards.
Within the categories above, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand its assortment and deliver member 
value.
Operations.  Sa
m's Club is available to members through warehouse club locations, as well as online or through the mobile 
application 24 hours a day.  Club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before regular operating hours.  Consistent 
with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience.  Curbside Pickup is 
available at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members.  Sam's Club also offers "Scan & Go," a 
mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations.  Sa
m's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and 
religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter 
ending January 31. 
Competition.  Sa
m's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as 
with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well 
as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses.  At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a 
quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members.  Our eCommerce website and 
mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.
Distribution.  W
e utilize 29 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the 
Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items.  During fiscal 2023, the 
majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were 
shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers.  Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through 
its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 13 dedicated 
eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.  
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport perishable and non-perishable 
merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary 
technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and 
others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to 
protect our proprietary rights.  We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain 
names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights.  Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications 
covering certain of our proprietary technology.  We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, 
certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
11
Suppl
iers and Supply Chain
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers 
from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online.  In many instances, we purchase 
merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in 
the "fresh" category.  Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant 
quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-
effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers.  
Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker 
safety laws and other applicable laws.  Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish 
to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those 
products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access 
for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer 
to our customers and members.
Government Regulation
As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which 
we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions.  For additional 
information, see the risk factors herein in "Item 1A. Risk Factors " unde
r the sub-caption "Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, 
Reputational and Other Risks."
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Priorities
Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create 
competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, 
suppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, 
including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building 
capabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems on which Walmart and our stakeholders rely. 
We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in 
relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG 
priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity.
•Opportunity.  Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance diversity, 
equity, and inclusion, and create opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human Capital 
Management section below), our suppliers and workers in supply chains, and the communities in which we operate. 
Doing so helps us fulfill our customer mission, strengthens our business and helps people build a better life for 
themselves and their families.
•Sustainability. Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value for both 
people and planet. With respect to people, our sustainability efforts include sourcing responsibly, helping prevent 
forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With 
respect to the planet, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, 
protecting and restoring nature, and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set 
science-based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040
—without offsets—and to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of emissions in our value chain by 2030 under our 
Project Gigaton™ initiative. 
•Community. Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by ope
rating our business in a way that meets the 
ne
eds of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by provi
ding sa
fer, healthier and more affordable 
food a
nd other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism, local grant programs and community cohesion 
ini
tiatives.
•Ethics and Integrity. At
 every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires trust among our 
assoc
iates, with our customers, and in the communities we serve. 
We
 periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and may update 
those
 disclosures from time to time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall 
be
 deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form
 10-K  or i
ncorporated by reference into any of our other 
fi
lings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Human Capital Management
At Walmart, we're committed to help people save money and live better around the world. This mission is delivered by our 
associates who make the difference for our millions of customers and members every day.  As of the end of fiscal 2023, we 
12
em
ployed approximately 2.1 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and 
approximately 0.5 million associates internationally.  In the U.S., approximately 93% of our associates are hourly and 
approximately 70% of our associates are full-time. 
We know the success and progress we've seen this year and throughout our Company's history is because of our associates who 
work every day to fulfill our mission.  That's why we're focused on providing opportunities for associates to grow and learn.  
For some, we are a foundational entry point to develop critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, and for others a 
place where associates can grow their careers across our global omni-channel business. No matter the role or location, we're 
focused on developing, rewarding, and retaining associates in an ever-changing environment. As customer expectations and 
technology change the nature of work, we know it's our people – our humanity – that will differentiate us from the competition, 
so this must be a top priority.  
Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: belonging, well-being, growth and digital.
Belonging  - 
Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions 
matter.  We are focused on having an inclusive culture where everyone feels they belong.  We publish our diversity 
representation twice yearly, and hold ourselves accountable to providing recurring culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion 
updates to senior leadership, including our President and CEO, and members of the Board of Directors.  Of the approximately 
2.1 million associates employed worldwide, 52% identify as women.  In the U.S., 50% of the approximately 1.6 million 
associates identify as people of color.
We review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices.  We are committed to creating a performance culture 
where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance, and the work they 
do.  
To build a company where associates feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates' feedback in a variety 
of ways, including but not limited to our annual associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one 
interactions.  Management reviews the results of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey.  
Well-being  - 
Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates.  We invest in our associates by 
offering competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory 
requirements. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-time associates as well as 
company paid benefits such as 401(k) match, family building support, maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-
time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral and mental health services, and a 
store discount card or Sam's Club membership.  Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, 
including wage structure and pay, can be found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available 
on our corporate website.  Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be 
deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other 
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to 
our associates is included in Note 11  t
o our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Growth  - 
Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with 
new skills.  We are invested in the growth of our associates in support of our business and their success by offering good jobs 
that lead to great careers and better lives.  We launched the global Walmart Academy to help associates build and grow their 
careers, creating one of the largest learning ecosystems in the world. The global Walmart Academy offers training for on-the-
job retail skills, leadership courses, and well-being training, serving associates through combination of  digital and in-person 
offerings. The global focus builds on moving much more to a learning in the flow of work approach.
We also provide access to educational opportunities for our part-time and full-time frontline eligible associates in the U.S. 
through our Live Better U program, which provides access to earn a high school diploma or a college degree. Walmart pays 
100% of associates' college tuition, books and fees. Our Live Better U program aligns education offerings with Walmart's own 
areas of growth, providing opportunities for associates to become great at the job they have today and prepare for the job of 
tomorrow. Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly 
positions.  Our focus on providing a path of opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and 
benefits, and career advancement creates a strong associate value proposition and strengthens our workforce.
Digital  - 
Accelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience and drive business results.  
To deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in digital tools like Me@Walmart, MyClub and 
Me@Campus to improve associate productivity, engagement, and performance. The MyFeedback app was developed to capture 
real-time associate feedback. Walmart supports associates who are on the U.S. Medical Plan with free virtual visits which 
include visits for medical doctor urgent care, along with mental health care with psychiatrist and psychologists.

ITEM 1A. RISK
 FACTORS
The
 risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our 
business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional 
factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we 
may face.
Strategic Risks
Fai
lure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology 
may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.
The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping.  As a result, the portion of 
total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of 
this increase could continue to accelerate.  
Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint 
ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our 
eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on 
the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings.  The success of this strategy will depend in 
large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and 
interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens and maintains our relationships with our customers across our various 
businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall enterprise strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the 
related risks discussed in this Item 1A .  W
ith the interconnected components of this enterprise strategy and an increasing 
allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or member perceptions about our reputation 
or our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net 
sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets.  In 
addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in 
the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of 
merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our 
financial performance.
Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including any operating losses 
incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these 
investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.
If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our 
relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our 
business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their 
shopping patterns.  The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of 
merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment.  Price 
transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary 
importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media 
available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products.  Our failure to adequately or effectively 
respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other 
failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns 
could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we 
offer, our market share and the growth of our business.
We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers, and other businesses 
which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important 
aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, 
social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in 
digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services.  The omni-channel retail 
landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive 
15
pre
ssures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to 
innovate and compete with us.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, 
services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping 
experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to 
customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and 
digital operations.
A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-
channel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our 
strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance.  See "Item 1. Business " a
bove for additional discussion of 
the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.
Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to 
bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-
channel ecosystems, or reductions in operations may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved 
access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions.  Such business 
combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, 
which could adversely affect our financial performance.
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial 
performance.
General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely 
affect our financial performance.  Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, 
natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, 
deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in 
consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending 
and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax 
laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or 
increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in 
the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and 
services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, 
cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and 
greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result 
in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, 
labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and 
other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses 
and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an 
increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing 
goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.
The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could 
materially adversely affect our financial performance.
We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or 
in other markets to expand our business.  These arrangements (such as ONE, our fintech joint venture, and our healthcare 
initiative with UnitedHealth Group) may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or 
may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the 
absence of such alliance.  In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or 
in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
16
Ope
rational Risks
Gl
obal or regional health pandemics or epidemics, including COVID-19, could negatively impact our business, financial 
position and results of operations. 
The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics or epidemics are uncertain and difficult to 
predict.  A pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other epidemic could impact our business operations, demand for our products and 
services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of 
measures to try to contain the spread of a virus or other disease (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-
place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, 
exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.  Customer behaviors changed rapidly during the 
course of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of 
the virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which 
may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors may result in higher 
demand for certain products and less demand for others, as well as out-of-stock positions in certain products, along with delays 
in delivering those products (due to supply chain and transportation issues) and could impact inventory levels in the future.  
Other factors and uncertainties may include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether 
there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which 
we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic 
uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and 
initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the 
effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments, including for any variants; the pace of 
recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the pandemic or epidemic on our business, including 
consumer behaviors.  These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our 
operations and our financial performance.
To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, or a future pandemic 
or epidemic occurs, such events may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those 
related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, 
cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and 
cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.
Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics, catastrophic and other 
events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, 
cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of 
climate change or otherwise; geopolitical tensions or events; regional or global health epidemics or pandemics or other 
contagious outbreaks (such as COVID-19); and catastrophic and other events, such as war, civil unrest (including theft, looting 
or vandalism), terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in 
our U.S. stores), or the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers 
are located, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine where a war currently exists between Ukraine and Russia) could 
adversely affect our operations and financial performance. 
Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or 
more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate 
work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected 
by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are 
located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including 
the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel 
and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the 
supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the 
delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction 
in the availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability 
or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply, or otherwise), the disruption 
(whether directly or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our 
stores, clubs and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities.  
Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, 
drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and 
unpredictable.  Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at 
stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain 
commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather 
17
eve
nts that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to 
transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; 
prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and 
confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in 
higher compliance risk and operational costs.
We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or 
fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their 
impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial 
performance. Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational performance. 
Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely 
affect our financial and operational performance .
Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers.  Global sourcing of many of the 
products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance.  We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, 
including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of 
conduct.  Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient 
manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and 
goods sourced outside the U.S.
Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers 
and their manufacturers are located (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to 
meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems 
experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and 
quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, 
clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we 
purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport 
security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control 
(such as, for example, the factors that occurred with respect to the availability of supply for baby formula during the prior fiscal 
year).
In addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs and other restrictions on the exportation and importation of goods, trade 
sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the limitation on the exportation or importation of certain types of 
goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our 
control.  These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operations and 
financial performance.
If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur 
liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material 
impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.  We are also subject to reputational and other risks related 
to third-party sales on our digital platforms.
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products.  Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products 
that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products 
from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is 
outside of our control.  Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such 
products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims.  As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-
food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance.  In addition, 
third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions.  Whether laws related 
to these marketplace transactions, including, but not limited to, intellectual property and products liability laws, apply to us is 
currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes or interpretations could expose us to liability, loss of sales, reduction in 
transactions and deterioration of our competitive position.  In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, 
including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to 
comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others.  Although we have marketplace compliance controls and impose 
contractual terms on sellers to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect certain prohibited items, 
enforce such terms, or collect sufficient damages for breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our 
business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and enterprise strategy. 
18
We
 rely extensively on information and financial systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our 
business.  Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our 
business-critical information systems.  Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, 
computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service 
attacks, security incidents and breaches (including through cyberattacks, which may be from cybercriminals or sophisticated 
state-sponsored threat actors), catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes and 
hurricanes, usage errors by our associates or contractors, civil or political unrest, or armed hostilities.  Our information systems 
are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, 
logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations.  Our information systems are not fully redundant and 
our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities.  If our systems are damaged, breached, attacked, interrupted, 
or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may 
experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim.  Any 
interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  In addition, 
we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and systems.  The risk of system disruption is 
increased when significant system changes are undertaken.  If we fail to timely or successfully integrate and update our 
information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from 
these initiatives. For example, during the first quarter of fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, we initiated an upgrade to our 
existing financial system, including our general ledger and other applications. If we are unable to implement this upgrade as 
planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected; our ability to assess those 
controls adequately could be delayed; and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows 
could be negatively impacted.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online and enable us to deliver 
products and services do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel 
business globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do 
comparison shopping.  We use social media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to 
enhance their shopping experience.  As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and 
shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or 
member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.  Omni-
channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world, and we continue to 
make investments in supply chain automation to support our omni-channel strategy. We must anticipate and meet our 
customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations 
through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating 
segment.  Moreover, some of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by 
third-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function 
as anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology or a faulty implementation, such failure can significantly 
interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing expectations. Any disruption or failure on our part to provide 
attractive, user-friendly, and secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise and services at competitive 
prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and 
developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient manner could place us at a 
competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material 
adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and 
results of operations.
Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the 
systems on which they run, including those applications and systems used in our acquired eCommerce, technology or other 
businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks.  Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce 
websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' 
information including personal information and/or payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Suc
h 
attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, 
degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' 
shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business.  If we are 
unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer 
loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for 
any damage to customers, members or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, 
any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of 
our strategy for the growth of our business.
19
Any fai
lure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, 
associates, business partners and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, 
could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, 
cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.
Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information and/or payment information about our 
customers and members, and we also receive and store information concerning our associates and vendors.  In addition, our 
health and wellness business operations, the Walmart Health locations, and third-party service providers who handle 
information on our behalf, store and maintain personal health information.  Some of this information is stored digitally in 
connection with the digital platforms and technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses.  We utilize 
third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content 
delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions.  Such providers may have access to information 
we hold about our customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors.  In addition, our eCommerce operations 
depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting 
cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other 
storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent.  Attacks against information systems and devices, whether 
our own or those of our third-party service providers, create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware, or 
phishing incidents. We expect to continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future.  Cyberattacks and threat actors can 
be sponsored by particular countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of 
motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to 
data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, 
worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer 
information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Mitigation and 
remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us.  The increased use of 
remote work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party 
service providers' systems have experienced security incidents or breaches and although they have not had a material adverse 
effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.
Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may 
also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a compromise or breach of our or their 
information systems.  Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of 
design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could 
compromise information security. 
Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential 
information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could 
harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or "HIPAA"), customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from 
customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could 
materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques 
used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately 
produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative 
measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security event, breach, vulnerability or compromise 
of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware 
or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation 
or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, members, financial 
institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.
Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk.  
Disruptions in our systems caused by security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do 
business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks, or utility companies) – could harm our ability to conduct our 
operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party 
service providers, customers, members, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis.
Our reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy, which combines 
traditional retail, membership models, marketplaces, financial services, healthcare, and other customer and business services 
into a series of interconnected assets to make it seamless for customers to interact with us. Security-related events could be 
widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and 
shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a 
material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting 
20
our ope
rations, net sales, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity.  Such events could also result in the 
release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in 
litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by 
our insurance policies.  Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant 
management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade 
further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts 
to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital 
operations.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, electronic benefits transfer 
(EBT) cards, mobile payments, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over 
time, which may have information security risk implications.  As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are 
subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and 
the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.  We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all 
of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, 
breaches, or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future.  In 
certain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, 
American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to 
payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process 
is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. 
Additionally, through various financial service partners and our ONE fintech joint venture, we offer various services such as 
money transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits 
cards, installment lending, and earned wage access. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory 
requirements, including privacy, authentication and tokenization, global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and 
regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.
The Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, 
retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches.  Among 
other obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under international, federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, 
government agencies and the media.  Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines, 
sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation. 
Changes in type or scope of offerings of our health and wellness business or the Walmart Health business could 
adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments across the U.S. and in various of our 
international markets such as Canada and Mexico. We also provide management services to Walmart Health centers that offer 
medical, dental, behavioral health and other health services in a number of states, as well as a national telehealth service 
provider. In addition, Walmart's 10-year collaboration with UnitedHealth Group includes agreements for Walmart Health to 
provide value-based care to patients in certain areas of the U.S., among other initiatives. 
A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through 
established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental 
agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: 
reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of 
our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable 
reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for 
reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion 
from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by 
PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we 
sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with 
which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes 
for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative 
distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance 
market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased 
competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options and/or home 
delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall 
economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are 
not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party 
reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use 
of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any 
21
addi
tional  changes in the state or federal regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical 
industry, including as a result of health reform efforts, and other changes to or novel interpretations of existing state or federal 
laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our 
pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such 
pharmaceuticals.  Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy 
customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.
Walmart Health clinical operations are also subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to: reductions in the third-party 
reimbursement rates for services; changes in our payer mix; changes in the health insurance market generally; our inability to 
retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans; competition for patients 
from other healthcare providers, including those that offer telehealth services; changes to healthcare provider utilization 
practices and treatment methodologies; trends toward value-based purchasing and price transparency; overall economic 
conditions and the ability of patients to pay for services; staffing challenges, including retention of a sufficient number and 
quality of healthcare professionals; compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations governing the healthcare 
industry; changes in laws and regulations, including as a result of health reform efforts; and healthcare technology initiatives, 
including those related to patient data and interoperability; and public health conditions.
One or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we 
sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or 
result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the 
type, volume and mix of services we provide, the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered, and the 
scope and pace of expansion of Walmart Health and related offerings. Any of these developments could, in turn, adversely 
affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other 
labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing 
number of qualified associates globally.  Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to 
fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while 
controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the 
availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment 
levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of 
new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational 
changes, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to 
effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-
retail businesses, including, for example, technology, health and wellness, and fintech businesses, and invest significant 
resources in training and motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including 
senior management and executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain 
associates.  If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the 
quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised, or novel interpretations of existing 
labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial 
performance could be materially adversely affected.
Financial Risks
Fai
lure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility 
of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results.  Any failure 
to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, capital 
expenditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted 
earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase 
programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities 
analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the 
price of our stock.

Fl
uctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported 
results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries.  Our 
Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate 
the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local 
currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period.  In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may 
also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial 
performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be 
without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates.  Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely 
affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our 
reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local 
currency of the country in which the goods will be sold.  When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the 
exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be 
unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding 
adverse effect on our gross profit.  Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to 
adversely affect our results of operations.  
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our
 international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic 
risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our 
business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, 
China, India and Mexico.
During fiscal 2023, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 17% of our consolidated net sales.  Walmart 
International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries.  Our future operating results 
in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control.  These factors 
include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory 
constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership 
restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such 
as trade protection measures or nationalization), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition 
investigations currently underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary 
Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local product safety and 
environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, foreign 
exchange or currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the 
countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.
The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and 
currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance.  Other factors which 
may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, 
laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with 
having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S.  Additional risks inherent in 
our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, 
adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S.  The 
various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be 
exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical 
tensions or events, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention 
of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries.  We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business 
practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and 
regulations.  Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including 
those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other 
countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance 
23
progra
ms and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations.  Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, 
could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.
Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
In fiscal 2023, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 83% of our consolidated net 
sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the 
U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on 
our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is 
manufactured in other countries.  Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost 
to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such 
merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international 
operations as well as our business.
We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or 
have historically operated.  The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities requires judgment and estimation.  Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being 
lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have 
higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax 
laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles.
We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative 
interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such 
changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As 
further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in 
our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other 
new tax rules, regulations, guidance, and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the 
Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of 
operations.
In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to or seek to 
enforce novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more 
permanent changes.  For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the "OECD"), the European 
Union and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to 
numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD's Pillar 
Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis and for which many jurisdictions 
have now committed to an effective enactment date starting January 1, 2024.  The impact of these potential new rules as well as 
any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.
Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the 
prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation.  Although we believe our tax estimates are 
reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial 
Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which 
such determination and settlement is made.
Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations, and interpretations of such laws and regulations 
specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate  could materially adversely affect our reputation, market 
position, or our business and financial performance.
We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate and could be materially 
adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, 
new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.  In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, 
and media scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere our practices and procedures to comply with these 
laws and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges.
Our health and wellness operations in the U.S. and the operations of the Walmart Health locations are subject to numerous 
federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those related to: licensing, reimbursement 
arrangements, and other requirements and restrictions; registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of 
controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; governmental and commercial reimbursement (including 
Medicare and Medicaid); data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data, including obligations and 
restrictions related to health information (such as those imposed under HIPAA); billing and coding for healthcare services and 
properly handling overpayments; debt collection; necessity and adequacy of healthcare services; relationships with referral 
sources and referral recipients and other fraud and abuse issues, such as those addressed by anti-kickback and false claims laws 
and patient inducement regulations; qualification of healthcare practitioners; quality and standards of medical services and 
24
equi
pment; and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare services, including 
limitations on the corporate practice of medicine in certain states. 
Health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify 
certain aspects of our operations.  For example, in the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") and various other 
regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled 
substances.  We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and 
comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, 
disposal and holding of controlled substances.  The DEA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state regulatory 
authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, 
civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  In addition, there has been recent heightened 
governmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing, which has resulted in federal and state legislation and 
regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to increase transparency in pharmaceutical product 
pricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which 
includes, among other matters, policies designed to impact drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government). 
Other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also impact our business or require us to modify certain aspects of 
our operations. We may not be able to predict the nature or success of reform initiatives, and the resulting uncertainties may 
have an adverse effect on our business. 
We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations 
related to competition and antitrust matters; protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including exposure to, 
and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; food and drug safety, including drug supply chain security 
requirements; trade, consumer protection, and safety, including the availability, sale, price label accuracy, advertisement, and 
promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as 
well as our ONE fintech joint venture); anti-money laundering prohibitions; consumer financial protection laws; economic, 
trade, and other sanctions matters; licensure, certification, and enrollment with government programs; data privacy and security 
and the sharing and interoperability of data; working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee 
benefit and other labor and employment matters; and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations 
outside of the U.S.  In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory 
requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as 
consumer financial protections laws and U.S. sanctions.  Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, 
including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability 
(including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could 
expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report.
Moreover, we are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer 
and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which was significantly 
modified by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Connecticut (the 
Connecticut Data Protection Act), Colorado (the Colorado Privacy Act), Utah (the Utah Privacy Act) and Virginia (the 
Consumer Data Protection Act), each of which go into effect in 2023, as well as other laws and regulations such as the Illinois 
Biometric Information Privacy Act,  the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the United 
Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), China's Personal Information 
Protection Act, and similar legislation in Quebec (An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of 
personal information, SQ 2021, c 25). The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching, continue to evolve, and may require 
us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. These and other 
privacy and cybersecurity laws may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. For example, in the case of non-
compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), 
regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover 
in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach.  Residents 
in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal 
information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal 
information is used. Laws such as those in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Utah, and Virginia may allow civil 
penalties for violations, and CCPA and CPRA provide a private right of action for data breaches.  Furthermore, our marketing 
and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection 
Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our 
business.  Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse 
publicity, impact our reputation and could require a costly response from and defense by us.
The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or 
regulatory scrutiny as to existing laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, in the U.S., shifting enforcement priorities 
for existing antitrust, competition, and pricing laws, as well as proposed new rules and regulations) generally cannot be 
predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices of 
25
exi
sting laws and regulations may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our 
operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or 
services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. If we fail to predict or respond adequately to changes, 
including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our 
business, operations, and financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations.  The regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these 
risks.  To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not 
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely 
affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of 
required licenses and certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug 
suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages.  Failure to comply with applicable legal or 
regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial 
exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results 
of operations.
We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results 
of operations, financial position and liquidity.
We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment.  We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, 
arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, 
healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities.  We may also have indemnification obligations for legal 
commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class 
action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be 
determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or 
exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.  For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of 
cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and 
state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought 
claims under federal and state consumer laws.
The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to 
nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and also is a defendant in numerous 
litigation proceedings related to opioids, including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription 
Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases 
that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, healthcare providers and 
other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement.  
The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of 
loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters. In addition, in July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in 
India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart and other parties requesting the recipients show cause as to why further 
proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged 
violations that related to a period prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018.  The Company can 
provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of proceeds the 
Company may receive in indemnification, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to 
its business or its consolidated financial statements. The Company is also a defendant in litigation with the Federal Trade 
Commission regarding the Company's money transfer agent services and is also cooperating with and responding to subpoenas 
issued by the U.S Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice 
regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's 
money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or 
investigations or any other related actions by governmental entities regarding these matters and can provide no assurance as to 
the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not 
be materially adversely affected.  We discuss in more detail these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under 
the caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and in Note 10 i
n the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part 
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
26
Our
 amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive 
forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the 
costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or  limit our shareholders' 
ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in 
such capacity.
Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the 
State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative 
claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity 
or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive forum 
provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial 
forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such 
capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these 
provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then 
we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our 
business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, 
our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude 
or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, 
including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and 
regulations promulgated thereunder.
Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our ESG goals.
We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in 
certain ESG priority issue areas.  From time to time, we announce certain aspirations and goals relevant to our priority ESG 
issues.  We periodically publish information about our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and 
update our ESG reporting from time to time.  Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, 
many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement 
of our ESG goals or that certain of our customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government 
agencies, and non-governmental organizations might not be satisfied with our goals or our efforts toward achieving those goals.  
Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not 
incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A failure or perceived failure to 
meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or shareholder support.

We
 own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas, that serve as our principal office and own and lease office facilities 
throughout the U.S. and internationally for operations as well as for field and market management.  The land on which our 
stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company.  We use independent contractors to construct our buildings.  All 
store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on 
sales volume.  Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include rent 
escalation clauses. For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our

PLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10  t
o our Consolidated Financial 
Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ," whi
ch is captioned "Contingencies," under the 
sub-caption "Legal Proceedings."  We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal 
proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought.  We provide the following additional 
information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, 
and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.
Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL"). The MDL is 
pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of March 3, 2023. The 
liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, 
regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the 
liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment 
on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately 
$651 million over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company 
has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and 
the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL has designated five additional single-
county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery. In addition, there are over 300 other cases pending in state and 
federal courts throughout the country as of March 3, 2023. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where 
applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.
Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement 
Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and 
Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described 
above), as described in more detail in Note 10 to t
he Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement 
agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of 
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits 
brought by state and local governments against the Company. The settlement will take effect if a sufficient number of political 
subdivisions also join.
DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed 
by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled 
Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 
12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed 
the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the 
Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending.
Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class 
actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various 
current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in 
which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in 
connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange 
Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District 
Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other 
derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware 
Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an 
amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the 
amended complaint. The court held a hearing on that motion on September 26, 2022; a ruling remains pending. The securities 
class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with 
respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, 
through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and 
appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 
8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to 
those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company 
moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.

II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: 
Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to 
Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain 
current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further 
proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against them 
based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in 
Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at 
the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is 
initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose 
monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to 
a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the 
allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice 
will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not 
currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or 
cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the 
notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to 
the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide 
no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements.  
III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters 
when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the 
Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million.  
In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing 
enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to 
be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart 
Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously 
defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for 
penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a 
material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no 
assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its 
business or its consolidated financial statements.

EMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OP
ERATIONS
Ove
rview
This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 
2022") and January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the 
accompanying notes.  We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our 
financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors 
that accounted for those changes.  We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's 
performance.  Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to 
provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and 
results of operations of the Company as a whole.
Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  
Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain 
corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's 
operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision 
maker. 
Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the 
performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period 
from the corresponding period in the previous year.  Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and 
clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce 
sales.  We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions 
which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, 
such as our Walmart Connect advertising business.  Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable 
sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail 
square feet of more than five percent.  Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales 
related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months.  Comparable sales are also referred 
to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry.  The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail 
industry.  As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by 
other companies.
In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the 
operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars.  We calculate the effect of 
changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's 
currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange 
rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.  Throughout our discussion, we refer to 
the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Volatility in currency exchange rates may 
impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the 
future.
We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio, primarily in the Walmart International segment, including 
the following highlights over the last three years:
• In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a pre-tax non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of 
$1.0 billion, primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses.  Refer to Note 12.
• I n Fe
bruary 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion, for which we recognized an 
estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.5 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing 
of the transaction. Refer to Note 11  a
nd Note 12 .
•In Ma
rch 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion, for which we recognized an 
estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.9 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing 
of the transaction.  Refer to Note 12 .
• I n Nove
mber 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary 
(Refer to Note 3 ) a
nd in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa. 
• In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart 
subsidiary.  Refer to Note 3 .
We
 operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve.  We face strong sales 
competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as 
well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising, and data service businesses.  Many of these 
competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce 
35
pre
sence.  We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates.  We, along with other retail 
companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks 
related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer 
disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, 
inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, 
deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax 
rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.  Further information on the factors that can affect our 
operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "Item 1A. 
Ri
sk Factors ." 
W
e are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low 
costs. However, like other retail companies, we have seen supply chain disruptions contributing to higher than 
normal inventory levels throughout the year. In addition, our merchandise costs for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 have 
been impacted by high inflation, greater than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross 
profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing 
strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers 
and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; 
and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not 
limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label 
brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain 
categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as 
a percentage of net sales.
We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation; swings in 
macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; supply chain pressures; 
and ongoing uncertainties related to global health epidemics or pandemics, any of which may impact our results.  For a detailed 
discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "Results of Operations " be

Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low 
costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which 
we operate.  We define our financial framework as:
• strong, efficient growth;
• consistent operating discipline; and
• strategic capital allocation.
As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.
Strong, Efficient Growth
Our obj
ective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, 
increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating 
eCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy.  At times, we make 
strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.
Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales 
for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous 
year.  The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar).  To be 
consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases.  
However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our 
fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. 
Calendar comparable sales, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2023 and 2022, were as follows:

parable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 8.2% and 7.7% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to 
the previous fiscal year.  Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 7.0% and 6.4% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For 
36
fi
scal 2023, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation 
impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions.  For fiscal 2022, comparable sales growth was 
driven driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which included strong consumer spending from government 
stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. Walmart U.S. 
eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022 as we continue 
to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.  
Comparable sales at Sam's Club increased 14.6% and 15.0% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For fiscal 2023, Sam's Club 
comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain 
merchandise categories. Sam's Club comparable sales for fiscal 2022 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket 
and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also included some higher inflation impacts in certain 
merchandise categories compared to recent years.  The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to 
remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales posi
tively contributed approximately 0.8% a
nd 1.3% 
to comparable sales for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Consistent Operating Discipline
We
 operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in 
which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve.  We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, 
manage inventory and reduce costs.  We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales 
growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses.

For fi
scal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal 
settlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart 
International segment.  These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs.
For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental 
COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments 
primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment.
Strategic Capital Allocation
Our st
rategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel 
experience for our customers.  As such, we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain, omni-channel initiatives, 
technology and store remodels and less to new store and club openings.  The following table provides additional detail:

with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics.  We also provide returns in the form of share 
repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources  se
ction.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment 
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics 
37
to a
ssess returns on assets.  While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a 
meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.  
Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.  
ROA was 4.6% and 5.6% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in net 
income, which was driven by lower operating income, partially offset by lapping debt extinguishment charges.		ROI was 12.7% 
and 14.9% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which was primarily due to a decrease in operating income which included 
charges associated with opioid-related legal settlements as well as reorganization and restructuring expenses, all recorded in 
fiscal 2023.  
We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent 
expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We consider average invested 
capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average 
amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.
Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that 
exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  For 
example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the 
numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in 
accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.  ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net 
income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain 
expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital.  Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we 
believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.  
Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI.  As a result, the 
method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.
The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP 
financial measure, is as follows:

Fre
e Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which 
measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in 
evaluating the Company's financial performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute 
for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our 
liquidity.  See "Liquidity and Capital Resources " for di
scussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating 
activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment 
made in that period.  We had net cash provided by operating activities of $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal 
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  We generated free cash flow of $12.0 billion, $11.1 billion and $25.8 billion for fiscal 
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 
2022. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income 
and the timing of certain payments.  Free cash flow for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 2022 due to the increase 
in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $3.8 billion in capital expenditures to support our 
investment strategy.  Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 
primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated 
inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when 
compared to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.8 
billion in increased capital expenditures.
Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary 
expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual 
obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a 
measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows .
Al
though other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. 
As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other 
companies to calculate their free cash flow.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by 
operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as 
information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

Unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end, and reflects the removal of stores in the 
U.K. and Japan subsequent to closing the divestitures in fiscal 2022.  Permanently closed locations are not included in these metrics.  
Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $38.5 billion or 6.7% and $13.6 
billion or 2.4% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  These increases in revenues 
were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased $38.1 billion or 6.7% and $12.5 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2023 and 
2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the increase was primarily due to strong 
positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which was driven by growth in average ticket, 
including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions, 
along with positive comparable sales in all of our international markets.  Additionally, net sales were negatively impacted by a 
decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of 
fiscal 2022 and $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2023.  For fiscal 2022, the increase was 
primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club which benefited from strong U.S. 
consumer spending and some inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our remaining international markets. 
The increase was partially offset by a $32.6 billion net sales decrease primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the 
U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales also benefited from a $4.5 billion positive impact of 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022.
Our gross profit rate decreased 98 and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the 
previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the decrease was primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher 
supply chain costs and inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment.  For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily 
due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost inflation as well as merchandise mix, partially offset by 
increased supply chain costs.
For fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal 
year.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal 
settlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart 
International segment.  These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs.  For 
fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental 
COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments 
primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment.  
Loss on extinguishment of debt was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the early retirement of certain higher rate long-term debt 
to reduce interest expense in future periods.
Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains 
or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. Other gains and losses consisted of 
a net loss of $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The net loss in fiscal 2023 primarily consists 
of: (a) net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity and other investments; (b) a gain of $0.4 billion 
recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil; and (c) a $0.2 billion dividend from one of our 
investments.  The net loss in fiscal 2022 primarily consists of net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity 
investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and 
Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

Our e
ffective income tax rate was 33.6% for fiscal 2023, 25.4% for fiscal 2022, and 33.3% for fiscal 2021, respectively.  The 
increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily due to the tax impact of the business 
reorganization resulting in the full separation of PhonePe from Flipkart. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 as 
compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the $8.3 billion loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations 
classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021, which provided minimal realizable tax benefit.  Our effective income tax rate 
may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, valuation 
allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings 
among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the 
U.S. statutory rate.  The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 
2021 is presented in Note 9 .
As a
 result of the factors discussed above, we reported $11.3 billion and $13.9 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2023 
and 2022, respectively, which represents a decrease of $2.6 billion and an increase of $0.2 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart 
("EPS") was $4.27, $4.87 and $4.75 for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in 
comparable sales of 7.0% and 6.4% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Comparable sales in fiscal 2023 were driven by 
growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as 
growth in transactions.  Comparable sales in fiscal 2022 were driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which 
included strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise 
categories compared to recent years.  Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable 
sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.
Gross profit rate decreased 85 basis points for fiscal 2023 and increased 51 basis points for fiscal 2022, when compared to the 
respective previous fiscal year.  The decrease in fiscal 2023 gross profit rate was primarily due to net markdowns and product 
mix shifts into lower margin categories and increased supply chain costs, partially offset by price management impacts driven 
by cost inflation.  Gross profit rate for fiscal 2022 benefited from price management driven by cost inflation as well as 
merchandise mix, which includes lapping the temporary closures of our Auto Care and Vision Centers and growth in our 
advertising business, partially offset by increased supply chain costs.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 25 basis points for fiscal 2023 when compared to the 
previous fiscal year primarily driven by strong sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by 
increased wage costs.  For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 31 basis points 
primarily due to investments in wages, partially offset by lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $1.9 billion.  
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $1.0 billion and increased $2.5 billion for fiscal 
2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

all of our international markets, offset by the impacts of a decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in 
the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as well as $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates during fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to 
the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  This decrease was 
partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates of $4.5 billion. 
Gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points and 55 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the 
previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the decrease was primarily driven by continued growth in lower margin formats and 
channels in China and category mix shifts into lower margin categories.  For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by 
shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 41 basis points and decreased 71 basis points for fiscal 2023 
and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of 
segment net sales for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred related to 
Flipkart and Massmart during the fourth quarter.  For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily due to impacts from the divested 
markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan 
subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 
2022. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $0.8 billion and increased $0.1 billion for fiscal

sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices.  Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of 
the Sam's Club segment in the future.  Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. 
Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $10.8 billion or 14.7% and $9.6 billion or 15.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales 
growth, including fuel, of 14.6%.  Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included 
higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories.  Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately  
0.8% t
o comparable sales which was primarily driven by ship to home and curbside pickup.  For fiscal 2022, the increase was 
primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions 
and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some

to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to 
comparable sales.
Gross profit rate decreased 155 basis points and 68 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the 
previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to inventory write-downs, elevated 
supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs and inflation related LIFO charges.  For fiscal 2022, gross profi
t rate decreased 
primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by 
favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales.
Membership and other income increased 7.0% and 13.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the 
previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the increase was primarily due to increases in new member sign-ups and Plus 
member penetration.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 97 basis points and 82 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Fiscal 2023 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 
primarily due to higher sales.  Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher 
sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco 
sales. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $0.3 billion and increased $0.4 billion for fiscal 
2023 a

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The
 strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.  Our cash flows 
provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund 
our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations.  Generally, some or 
all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  We 
believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay 
dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and the 
timing of certain payments.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022, when compared to the 
previous fiscal year, was primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the 
impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. 
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit 
Cash and cash equivalents were $8.6 billion and $14.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Our working 
capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.5 billion and $6.3 billion as of January 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively.  The increase in our working capital deficit is primarily driven by a decrease in cash and cash 
equivalents and an increase in accrued liabilities.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of 
cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of 
payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. 
We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is 
needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from 
jurisdictions outside of the U.S.  Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment 
of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as 
withholding or state taxes. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of 
cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations.
As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely 
transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest 
shareholders.

t cash used in investing activities was $17.7 bi
llion, $6.0 billion and $10.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively, and generally consisted of capital expenditures.  Net cash used in investing activities increased $11.7 bi

fi
scal 2023 whe
n compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the result of lapping the net proceeds received from the 
divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan and an increase in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy.  
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.1 billion for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily 
due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, partially offset by increased 
capital expenditures. 
Capital expenditures
Refer to the "Strategic Capital Allocation " se

apital expenditure detail for fiscal 
2023 and 2022.  For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"), we project capital expenditures will be 
approximately $17 billion to $18 billion, with a focus on technology, supply chain, and customer-facing initiatives.

Net cash used in financing activities $ (17,039) $ (22,828) $ (16,117) 
Ne
t cash from financing activities generally consists of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and 
transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders.  Fiscal 2023 net cash used in financing activities decreased $5.8 bi
llion 
when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The decrease is primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment 
of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes in the prior fiscal period, partially offset by the equity funding from 
the sale of subsidiary stock in the prior fiscal period.  Fiscal 2022 net cash used in financing activities increased $6.7 billion 
when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increase was primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related 
payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes, as well as increased share repurchases, partially offset by 
long-term debt issuances and equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock.
Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stoc k
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of 
the Company's Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership of Massmart from approximately 
53% to 100%.  Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously 
consolidated as a variable interest entity and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner.
During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-
owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to 
approximately 75%.
Short-term Borrowings
We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, 
share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. The following table includes additional information related 
to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:

that provide additional liquidity, if needed.  Additionally, we maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the U.S. to 
further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed. 
As of January 31, 2023, we have $2.1 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available, of which $1.8 billion was 
drawn and represents an unrecorded current obligation.

Financial Statements for details on the issuances of long-term debt.
Estimated contractual interest payments associated with our long-term debt amount to $18.8 billion, with approximately $1.7 
billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2024.  Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected 
maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate 
instruments.

Company
 Share Repurchase Program 
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the 
Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the 
plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022.  In November 2022, the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase 
program which, beginning on November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase program.  As of January 31, 2023, 
authorization for $ 19.3 bi
llion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are 
constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.  
We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, 
including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the 
market price of our common stock.  We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded 
through the Company's free cash flow.  
The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and 
total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:

Mat
erial Cash Requirements
Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, 
interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations.  Other 
material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include opioid and other legal settlements, short-term 
borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, purchases of subsidiary stock and purchase obligations.  See 
Note 3 , 
Note 6  a
nd Note 7  t
o our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding purchase of subsidiary stock, 
outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.
45
As of Ja
nuary 31, 2023, the Company has $33.3 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $11.6 billion 
is due within one year.  Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and 
utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and 
legally binding service contracts.  Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that 
are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be 
purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  Contracts that specify 
the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not 
include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above.  Accordingly, purchase orders for 
inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  Our 
purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods.  We also 
enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts 
generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.  Timing of payments and actual amounts paid 
may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some 
obligations.
Capital Resources
We
 believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will 
continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal 
buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share 
repurchases.
We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance 
our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets.  As of January 31, 2023, the ratings assigned to our commercial 
paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:
Ratin
g agency   Commercial paper   Long-term debt
Standard & Poor's   A-1+   AA
Moody's Investors Service   P-1   Aa2
Fitch Ratings   F1+   AA
Cre
dit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be 
subject to revision at any time.  Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent 
over time.  Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic 
environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in 
our business strategy.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs 
or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.  In addition, any downgrade 
of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility 
that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  
The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities.  Each 
rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated 
independently of any other rating.  Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and 
disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology.  In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial 
Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  These principles require us to make certain 
estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.  
These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes.  Actual results may differ from 
our estimates.
Management continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and 
disclosed in our financial statements.  Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in 
preparation of the financial statements.
Inventories
The Walmart U.S. segment comprises the largest portion of our inventory and is primarily accounted for under the retail 
inventory method of accounting to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") valuation method.  The 
majority of the Sam's Club segment inventories are accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. 
When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to 
actual results determined at year-end.  As a measure of sensitivity, an incremental 1% inflationary impact to the cost of our 
inventory purchases would not have resulted in a material increase to the LIFO provision recorded during fiscal 2023.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique 
commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.  Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but 
are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives.  Indefinite-lived 
acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.  Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative 
assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary.  If we determine, after performing an assessment 
based on qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset is more likely than not less than 
the carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed.  The quantitative test for impairment requires 
management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions.  Our 
indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost.  Because of the 
nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be 
materially impacted. 
Contingencies
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a 
loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss 
contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of 
47
am
ounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial 
statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We 
review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a 
reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made.  Although we are not able to predict the outcome or 
reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10  t
o our Consolidated Financial Statements 
and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash 
flows.
Income Taxes
Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign 
jurisdictions.  Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in 
certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.  Our effective income tax rate is affected by many 
factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, 
changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and 
international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.
Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.  The 
benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not 
probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.  When facts and 
circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.  We 
account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet 
before being recognized in the financial statements.  This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax 
positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years.  Such assets 
arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net 
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation 
allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing 
whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations 
of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the 
deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal 
of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on 
estimates.
As guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our 
estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. 
ITEM 7A.QUANT
ITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Mar
ket Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, 
currency exchange rates and the fair values of certain equity and equity method investments measured on a recurring basis.
The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to 
calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes.  The effect of a change in a particular 
assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption.  In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a 
change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  We hedge a portion of 
our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps.  For fiscal 
2023, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $0.6 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. 
The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  For long-
term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.  
For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual 
maturity date, unless otherwise noted.  The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under 
the contracts.  The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2023.

eign-held debt and secured debt. 
As of January 31, 2023, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, 
represented 21% of our total short-term and long-term debt.  Based on January 31, 2023 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in 
prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion.
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than 
the U.S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt.  For fiscal 2023, movements in currency exchange rates 
and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $1.1 billion net loss in the currency translation and 
other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  
We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps.  The aggregate fair value of these swaps was 
in a liability position of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively.  The change in 
the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar relative to certain currencies in fiscal 2023.  The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. 
dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.7 
billion.  A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 
2023 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.1 billion.
In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of 
purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies.
Investment Risk
We are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the fair value of equity securities, as well as certain 
immaterial equity method investments where we have elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis.  These 
changes in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a loss of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily due 
to net decreases in the underlying stock prices of those investments.  As of January 31, 2023, the fair value of our equity 
investments, including certain equity method investments, measured on a recurring basis was $10.7 billion.  As of January 31, 
2023, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments 
by approximately $1.1 billion.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2023 and 
2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements").  In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company at January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended January 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(2013 framework) and our report dated March 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included 
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that 
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that 
are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The 
communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical 
audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Contingencies
Description of 
the MatterAs described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2023, the Company is 
involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters.  The Company records a liability for 
those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when management determines it is probable that a loss 
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  The Company also discloses 
when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred.  In assessing the probability of 
occurrence and whether an estimate of loss can be reasonably estimated for a particular legal proceeding, 
management exercises judgment on matters relevant to each proceeding, such as whether sufficient 
participation in settlement proceedings will occur, or whether it can predict the number of claims that 
may be filed.  For example, management exercised judgment in accruing a liability for approximately 
$3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework and other previously agreed state and tribal settlements 
regarding opioid-related lawsuits. Auditing management's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss 
contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant 
judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence for contingencies or when 
determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made.

over the identification and evaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the 
Company's assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company's determinations regarding the 
measurement of loss. 
To test the Company's assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of 
loss, or range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of 
directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewed documents provided to the Company by 
certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and outside legal counsel, 
and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal and outside legal 
counsel. As part of this assessment, we evaluated management's assumptions and calculations by, among 
other things, comparing those assumptions to key terms in the Settlement Framework and to payments 
made during the year. We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc.  
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).  In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements 
of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
January 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated March 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent 
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help people 
around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail 
stores and through eCommerce.  Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric 
experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers.  
The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended 
January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022") and January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021").  Intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it 
has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.  Investments in common stock or 
in-substance common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for 
under the equity method.  These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States 
("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based 
on a calendar year.  There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2023 related to the operations 
consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  
Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities.  Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may 
differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  All credit 
card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash 
equivalents.  The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.0 billion and 
$1.7 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world.  Of the Company's $8.6 billion and $14.8 billion 
in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, approximately 62% and 50% were held outside of 
the U.S., respectively.  Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the 
Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in 
which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. 
As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may 
not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling 
interest shareholders.
Receivables
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: 
customers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and 
electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; 
governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions.  As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, net receivables from 
transactions with customers were $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.
59
Inv
entories
The Company utilizes various inventory methods to account for and value its inventories depending upon the nature of the store 
formats and businesses in each of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net 
realizable value, as appropriate.  
• Walmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting 
("RIM") to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") valuation method.  RIM generally results in 
inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a 
reduction of the retail value of inventory.
• Walmart International Segment – Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted 
for using either the RIM or weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method. 
• Sam's Club Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted-
average cost LIFO method.
For those segments that utilize the LIFO method, the Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the 
projected annual effect of inflation or deflation.  These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end for 
inflation or deflation and inventory levels. 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost.  Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred.  
Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  The 
following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are 
generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:
Estimated
 Useful Lives As of January 31,
(Dollars in millions) (in Years) 2023 2022
Land N/A $ 19,317 $ 19,204 
Buildings and improvements 3 - 40  104,554  100,376 
Fixtures and equipment 2 - 30  65,235  60,282 
Transportation equipment 3 - 15  2,462  2,263 
Construction in progress N/A  10,802  7,199 
Property and equipment  202,370  189,324 
Accumulated depreciation  (101,610)  (94,809) 
Property and equipment, net $ 100,760 $ 94,515 
Le
asehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining 
expected lease term.  Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases 
and intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $10.9 billion, $10.7 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively.
Leases
For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a 
lease.  The Company records right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are 
initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease.  If the rate implicit in the 
Company's leases is not readily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the 
present value of the sum of the lease payments.
Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is 
reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease 
obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. 
For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such 
as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.
60
Im
pairment of Long-Lived Assets
Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which 
is at the individual store or club level.  Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated 
over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections.  If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may 
not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as 
determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. 
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is 
allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired.  Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired 
as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived 
intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.  Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived 
assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.
Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition.  Components within the same reportable 
segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.  As of 
January 31, 2023, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Goodwill 
and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative 
approach for each of the Company's reporting units.  Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether 
a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.  If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the 
qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair 
value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill 
impairment test would be required.  The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of 
the related reporting units.  Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based 
approaches.  Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly 
greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.
The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2023 and 2022:

angible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of January 31, 2023 
and 2022, the Company had $4.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily 
consists of acquired trade names.  There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 
2022 or 2021.  
Fair Value Measurement
The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  The fair value of an 
asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties 
able to engage in the transaction.  The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new 
obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.  Refer to 
Note 8  for m
ore information. 
Investments
Investments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Changes in fair 
value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair 
value option measured on a recurring basis, are recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of 
Income.  These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net losses of $1.7 billion 
and $2.4 billion for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively and net gains of $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily due to net 
changes in the underlying stock prices of those investments.  Refer to Note 8  for de
tails.  Equity investments without readily 
61
de
terminable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and 
losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  
Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value and adjustments in fair value are recorded within 
other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company 
had $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in debt securities classified as trading.
Indemnification Liabilities
The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification 
liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception.  As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the 
Company had $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, of certain legal indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred 
income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The maximum of potential future payments under these 
indemnities was $3.1 billion, based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2023. 
Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto 
liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits.  Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are 
used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis.  The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate 
cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these 
outstanding claim payments.  On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.  
To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-
loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.
Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, 
as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.  Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the 
Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks.  The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of 
nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives.  Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, 
including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty.  
The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating 
agencies. The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures 
with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The 
Company's collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, 
after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received from counterparties and 
cash collateral provided to counterparties under these arrangements wa
s not significant  as of Ja
nuary 31, 2023 and 2022.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge.  If a 
derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded 
through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the 
hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the 
Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings.  
Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current 
assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, 
based on maturity date.  Refer to Note 8  for t
he presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities. 
Fair Value Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value 
of fixed-rate debt.  All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut 
method requirements under U.S. GAAP.  Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to 
exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.  These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from 
April 2023 to September 2031.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency 
exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt.  The 
Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently 
reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  These derivatives will mature on 
dates ranging from July 2024 to January 2039.
62
Ne
t Investment Hedges
Prior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12 , t
he Company 
was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure 
associated with net investments of these foreign operations.  Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded 
in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated 
long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded 
foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Upon 
closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were 
released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4 .  
Inc
ome Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the 
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing 
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary differences").  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The 
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the 
enactment date.
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not 
more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the 
deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward 
periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by 
assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, 
forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  These sources of income rely on estimates.
In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent 
differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates.  Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes 
in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be 
taken in a tax return.  The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and 
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  
Refer to Note 9  for a
dditional income tax disclosures.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are 
presented as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are 
recorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each 
reporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable 
noncontrolling interest are recognized in capital in excess of par.  As of January 31, 2023, the Company has a redeemable 
noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option 
which may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027 with annual options thereafter.
Revenue Recognition
Net Sales
The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or 
services to the customer.  eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer.  
Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.
Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membership fee revenue over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months.  
Membership fee revenue was $2.6 billion for fiscal 2023, $2.2 billion for fiscal 2022 and $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021.  
Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  
Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
63
Gi
ft Cards
Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise 
using the gift card.  Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members 
can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely.  Gift cards in some countries where the Company does 
business have expiration dates.  While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both 
with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed.  Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes 
revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the 
expected redemption period. 
Financial, Advertising and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed.  Generally, revenue from 
services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs 
from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the 
cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers.  Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments 
that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances 
and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and 
supplier-specific fixtures.  Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited 
situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the 
Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.
Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as 
described above.  As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart 
International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.  Because the 
Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in 
cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that 
may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements and are recorded in 
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising costs 
were $4.1 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.2 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar 
using exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated 
other comprehensive loss.  The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated 
from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income 
statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of 
Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for 
investors and other allocators of capital. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, 
including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively 
to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for disclosure of rollforward information, which should be applied 
prospectively. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.

 2.  Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding 
during the relevant period.  Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average 
common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.  The Company did 
not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net 
income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.

The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion, of which 2.7 billion and 2.8 billion were issued and 
outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  
Purchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock
During fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's 
Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%.  
Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a 
variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner.
Also during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe, a digital transaction platform in India, from 
approximately 76% to approximately 89% as part of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary.  In 
consideration for the transaction, the Company recorded a liability to noncontrolling interest holders of $0.9 billion within 
accrued liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-
owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to 
approximately 75%.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company.  The 
compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's 
consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal 
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and 
administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  The total income tax benefit recognized for 
share-based compensation was $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The 
following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans:

stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation 
65
awa
rds for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered 
under the Securities Act of 1933.  The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with 
those of its shareholders.
The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:
•Restricted Stock Units.  Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period.  
Beginning in fiscal 2023, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 8% each quarter over a three year period from 
the date of grant.  For grants made from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 
25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant.  Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of restricted stock units 
generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years from the grant date.  The 
fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the 
expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The expected 
dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the 
dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 2.3%, 
3.8% and 4.4%, respectively.
• Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units.  Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based 
on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment.  Performance-based restricted stock units vest 
based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0% to 150% of the 
original award amount.  Vesting periods for restricted stock are generally between one month and three years.  Vesting 
periods for performance-based restricted stock units are generally between one and three years.  Restricted stock and 
performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the 
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant 
and is expensed ratably over the vesting period.  The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is 
determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the 
vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to 
determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 3.3%, 4.2% and 
4.5%, respectively.
In addition to the Plan, Flipkart and PhonePe have share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to 
acquire their own common shares may be issued.  These plans may be subject to performance or other conditions, including 
vesting upon an initial public offering. Share-based compensation expense associated with certain of these plans is included in 
the Other line in the table above.

Share
 Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the 
Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the 
plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022.  In November 2022, the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase 
program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, 
and beginning November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase program.  As of January 31, 2023 authorization for 
$19.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively 
retired and returned to an unissued status.
The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share 
repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations 
and the market price of the Company's common stock.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of 
shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:

 8.  Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in 
measuring fair value.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
• Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
• Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop 
its own assumptions.
As described in Note 1 , t
he Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method 
investments, on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair values of the Company's equity 
investments measured on a recurring basis are as follows:
(A

Total $ 10,669 $ 11,888

De
rivatives
The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value.  Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would 
receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.  The fair values have been 
measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward 
curves.  As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

rimarily classified in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are 
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a 
result of impairment charges.  
Upon completing the sales of the Company's operations in the U.K. in February 2021 and Japan in March 2021, the Company 
recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and 
losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Refer to Note 12 . T
he Company did not have any material assets or liabilities 
resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2023. 
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale 
criteria in fiscal 2021, as further discussed in Note 12 .  As a
 result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, 
less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction's expected consideration. The 
carrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the 
Company recognized non-recurring impairment charges.  The aggregate pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion associated with the 
divestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated 
Statements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021, and included these impairment charges as well as a $2.3 billion 
charge related to the Asda pension plan.  These impairment charges included the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative 
foreign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair 
value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost.  The carrying values of 
these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost.  The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the 
Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  The carrying value and fair value 
of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:

Unre
mitted Earnings
Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign 
subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the 
majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. 
federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2023, the Company has not 
recorded approximately $3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered 
indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.
Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
As of January 31, 2023, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $32.3 billion.  
Of these carryforwards, approximately $19.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2043.  The remaining 
carryforwards have no expiration. 
The realizability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable 
income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, 
forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely 
than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established.  To the extent that a 
valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets 
will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $7.8 billion and $9.5 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation 
allowance during fiscal 2023 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration 
of unrealized deferred tax assets.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining 
a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.
As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.3 
billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective 
income tax rate was $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:
 Fiscal Years En

(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021

Lapse in statutes of limitations  (37)  (33)  (28) 
Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 3,307 $ 3,245 $ 3,135 
The
 Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, 
general and administrative expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for 
fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.  During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce 
unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the 
Company agrees to their disallowance.  The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

The
 Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2018 through 
2022.  The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 
2022, and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2015 through 2022. With few exceptions, 
the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 
2013.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes.  A number of 
these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions.  In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments 
from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations.  Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or 
range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided 
adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 10.  Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for 
those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be 
incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into 
settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the 
aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ng fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described 
below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable 
and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future 
events. Moreover, the Settlement Framework will only take effect once a sufficient number of political subdivisions join, and 
there is no assurance regarding such participation. The amount of ultimate loss may thus differ materially from this accrual. The 
Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to 
believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation.
In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a 
wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, 
individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The 
consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL") and 
is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the 
cases included in the MDL. 
Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare 
providers, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive 
damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information 
requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution 
practices involving opioids.
On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially 
all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as 
part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or pending state court, as well as all 
potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to 
approximately $3.1 billion (the "Settlement Amount"). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged 
harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent 
settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for 
the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation 
thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the "Settlement 
Framework."
The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are 
contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not 
yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a 
prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, 
including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other 
75
U.S. t
erritories (the "Settling States"), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. The 
settlement with the Settling States is now contingent upon, among other applicable terms and conditions, a sufficient number of 
political subdivisions also agreeing to participate in the Settlement Framework. 
If all conditions for the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, the minimum participation thresholds applicable 
for political subdivisions are satisfied within the prescribed deadlines, then the Company would expect to pay up to the full 
portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States, beginning as early as the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 
being completed during fiscal 2024. However, the Company cannot predict if, when, or to what extent the Settlement 
Framework will be finalized with any of the Settling States.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company paid $0.4 billion for separate settlements with Cherokee Nation, New Mexico, 
and Florida. Following these payments, the remaining $2.9 billion liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements 
is recorded in accrued liabilities within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023. 
The Settlement Framework also provides for payments to Native American tribes (excluding Cherokee Nation), contingent 
upon the number of tribes, including those tribes that have not yet sued the Company, that agreed to participate in the 
Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline (the "Settling Tribes"). Pursuant 
to the terms of the Settlement Framework, on March 3, 2023, the Company paid approximately $0.1 billion to the Settling 
Tribes in satisfaction of their claims against the Company. 
Other Opioid Related Litigation 
The
 Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise extinguished by 
the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by 
healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers, as well as any action filed by a state, political subdivision, or Native 
American tribe that does not agree to the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these 
opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these 
matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its 
business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
Two-county Trial and MDL Bellwethers. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a 
jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. 
The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three 
defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and 
several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the 
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the 
judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023.
The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five 
counties ultimately may elect to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather 
than go to trial. 
DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation.  On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") filed a civil complaint in the 
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its 
pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct 
resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company 
initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an 
amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended 
complaint. That motion remains pending.
Opioid Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation.  In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities 
class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed 
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class 
of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been 
consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties 
had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an 
amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022 and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those 
who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a 
motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.
Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware 
on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors 
with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal 
securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's 
opioids disclosures.  Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters.  On September 27, 
2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the 
76
curre
nt Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's 
prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the 
plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss 
and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. On September 26, 2022, the court held a hearing on that 
motion, and a ruling remains pending.
Other Legal Proceedings 
Asda E
qual Value Claims.  Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value 
claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf 
of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the "Asda 
Equal Value Claims"). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the 
Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains 
with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually 
determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate 
any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to 
the scope and outcome of these matters.
Money Transfer Agent Services Matters.  The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States 
Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") seeking 
documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the 
Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The 
Company continues to cooperate with and provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also 
responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the 
FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 
2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that 
Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent 
services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss 
the complaint, on October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company filed its reply. 
The court has entered an order staying discovery pending a decision on the Company's motion to dismiss. The Company intends 
to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these 
matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no 
assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
Note 11.  Retirement-Related Benefits
The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan 
immediately upon hire.  The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can 
begin to contribute generally after one year of employment.  Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company 
matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings.  The matching contributions immediately vest 
at 100% for each associate.  Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory 
limits.
Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment 
benefit arrangements.  These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which 
they are established.
The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2023, 
2022 and 2021:

Addi
tionally, the Company's previously owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom sponsored a defined benefit pension plan.  In 
fiscal 2020, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the "Plan") entered into an agreement pursuant 
to which Asda made a cash contribution of $1.0 billion to the Plan (the "Asda Pension Contribution") which enabled the Plan to 
purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants, and released the Plan and Asda from any future 
obligations.  In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $2.3 billion were included in the 
disposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in Note 8  a

 12.  Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items
The following dispositions impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also 
occurred.  
Asda
In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net 
consideration of $9.6 billion.  Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion 
in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes 
in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon 
closing.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized 
its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax 
indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Asda was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company 
recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $5.5 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.  Upon classifying the Asda disposal group as held for sale, $2.3 billion of accumulated pension 
components associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as part of the loss.  In 
calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $0.8 billion related to the estimated fair 
value of certain indemnities and other transaction related costs.
Seiyu
In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration 
of $1.2 billion.  Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains 
and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net 
assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing.  
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its 
retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.
Seiyu was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company 
recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. 
Walmart Argentina
In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of 
$1.0 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to 
the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group.
Note 13.  Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located 
throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.  The Company previously operated in 
Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and 
Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to Note 12 for di
scussion of recent 
divestitures.  The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and 
Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker 
("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products 
and services in each of its segments.  It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products 
and services.
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes 
omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect.  The 
Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-
channel initiatives.  The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and 
omni-channel initiatives.  Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the 
Company's segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating 
income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of 
each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly 
78
re
viewed by its CODM.  Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the 
reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table:

NTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Eval
uation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is 
required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  In designing and 
evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and 
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Our management is necessarily 
required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities.  Since 
we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more 
limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and 
processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control 
environment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, 
automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations 
and increasing monitoring controls.  These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially 
affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal 
control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the 
period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that 
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable 
assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's 
rules and forms.
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal 
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not 
prevent or detect misstatements.  Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting as of January 31, 2023.  In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).  
Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 
January 31, 2023.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, has been audited by Ernst &

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
