associated with various investigations and proceedings; forecasts of capital expenditures; forecasts of expense reduction; estimates and assumptions used in
critical accounting estimates, including those relating to insurance receivables, regulatory assets and liabilities, environmental remediation, litigation, third-
party claims, the Wildfire Fund, and other liabilities; and the level of future equity or debt issuances. These statements are also identified by words such as

catastrophic wildfires, including whether the Utility maintains an approved WMP and a valid safety certification and whether the Wildfire Fund has
sufficient remaining funds;
•the risks and uncertainties associated with wildfires that have occurred or may occur in the Utility’s service area, including the wildfire that began on
October 23, 2019 northeast of Geyserville in Sonoma County, California (the “2019 Kincade fire”), the wildfire that began on September 27, 2020 in

This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Each of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is a separate entity, with
distinct creditors and claimants, and is subject to separate laws, rules, and regulations.
11
Over the past several years, Northern California has experienced major wildfires. For more information about material wildfires, see Item 7. MD&A, and Note
15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
This 2022 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of the significant
risks that could affect the outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Triple Bottom Line
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s purpose is to deliver for their hometowns, serve the planet, and lead with love. In support of this purpose, the companies
employ a Lean operating model designed to drive more effective and responsive decision-making, reduce the difficulties many coworkers face in their day-to-
day work, and deliver better outcomes for customers and communities.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the “triple bottom line” of people, planet, and
prosperity, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value they create for customers and investors, but
also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line is designed to balance the interests of the companies’ many stakeholders, and
it reflects the broader societal impacts of the companies’ activities.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and prosperity in their daily operations as
well as in their long-term strategic decisions. The Utility will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment in order to support its customer-driven
investment plan while pursuing cost-control measures that would allow it to maintain the affordability of its service. The Lean operating system is an important
means of realizing PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s objective of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.
People
The people element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to their workforce, their customers, the residents of
local communities in which the companies do business, and other stakeholders.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s goal is to continually reduce risk to keep customers, the communities they serve, and their workforce (both employees
and contractors) safe. Their focus is on continuously building an organization where every work activity is designed to facilitate safe performance, every
worker knows and practices safe behaviors, and every individual is encouraged to speak up and stop work if they see unsafe or risky behavior, and has
confidence that their concerns and ideas will be heard and pursued. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to significantly improving their safety
performance by understanding their risks, prioritizing their work, using controls to reduce risks, and continuously measuring and improving risk reduction.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s human capital resource objectives are to build and retain an engaged, well trained, diverse, and equitably-paid workforce.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility place a high priority on delivering customer value and providing a hometown customer experience. The Utility’s customer-
driven investment program is aimed at improving safety, increasing electric and gas reliability, and improving customer satisfaction.
For more information, see “Human Capital” below.
Planet
The planet element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to protect and serve the environment. This
commitment extends beyond compliance with various state and federal environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility believe that integrating and managing climate change and other environmental considerations in the companies’ business strategies creates long-term
value for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and for their customers, communities, coworkers, and other stakeholders. Mitigating and adapting to the impacts
of climate change presents opportunities for growth for the Utility’s business and economic opportunity for the communities it serves.
12
The Utility strives to be prepared to continue to deliver safe, clean, affordable, and reliable energy in the face of increasingly severe and extreme climate-driven
natural hazards. To build resilience to these hazards, the Utility is working to systematically integrate the consideration of forward-looking climate data and
tools in its decision-making. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also work with policymakers and regulators to advance effective climate adaptation policy in
California, and work directly with local governments and communities on adaptation solutions.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have committed to helping heal the planet. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Climate Strategy Report, which is
available to the public, describes the companies’ climate goals and plans to meet those goals. To meet their longer-term climate goals, PG&E Corporation and
the Utility intend to scale their efforts to decarbonize the electric system to accommodate a shift to vehicle electrification, integrate a proliferation of distributed
energy resources, and achieve increased penetration of renewable energy combined with investments in the grid and energy storage.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility also plan to transition the gas system to cleaner fuels, increasingly target natural gas delivery for hard-to-electrify customer
sectors, and support efforts to accelerate building electrification. The objective is to do so in an orderly manner to achieve a positive customer and community
experience, while reducing natural gas system investments in targeted electrified communities.
The impacts of climate change on the Utility’s infrastructure are already a reality. Record-breaking extreme heat and heat waves are increasingly a regular
occurrence throughout California. Peak electric loads are expected to increase with increasing temperatures due to direct impacts of ambient temperatures on
equipment and direct impacts on electricity demand driven by rising air conditioning installation and usage, and increasingly driven in the future from
widespread progress in adoption of beneficial electrification technologies. The Utility’s assets on the coast and in or near watersheds face potential increased
exposures to coastal, riverine, and precipitation-related flooding because of climate-driven changes in precipitation and sea-level rise.
Climate change will also continue to intensify the potential for wildfires throughout California. The worsening conditions across California increase the
likelihood and severity of wildfires, including those where the Utility’s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire’s ignition. Reducing risk will be
even more important as climate change continues to exacerbate the risks facing the Utility. A key element of preparing the Utility for the physical risks of
climate change is an updated and more detailed system-wide CVA of the Utility’s assets, operations, and services, which the Utility expects to file with the
CPUC in 2024. The CVA is expected to improve the Utility’s understanding of its exposure to climate hazards and the sensitivity of assets and operations to
these hazards.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to pursue policies and programs that enable safe, reliable, and affordable clean and resilient energy for their
customers. As a result of actions already taken by PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the companies have:
•Delivered clean electricity to customers in 2022 that was more than 95% GHG free.
•Helped customers avoid emissions and energy costs through robust energy efficiency programs.
•Awarded contracts for more than 3.3 GWs of battery energy storage to be deployed over the next several years, strengthening California’s grid
efficiency and reliability.
•Installed approximately 340 charging ports for electric vehicles at schools, parks, public charging locations, and in support of fleets - with nearly half
in disadvantaged communities - and received regulatory approval for new innovative pilots on vehicle grid integration, submetering, and dynamic
rates.
•Brought the total number of interconnected private solar customers to more than 700,000 and supported more than 50,000 customers who have
installed battery storage at their homes or businesses.
•Continued to advance decarbonization initiatives for the Utility’s natural gas delivery system, including meeting the CPUC-mandated methane
emission reduction target ahead of schedule and accelerating initiatives to meet its voluntary 2030 reduction goal.
13
The CPUC coordinates the planning of supply resources through the Integrated Resource Planning (“IRP”) proceeding and has determined that replacing the
power generated by Diablo Canyon is the responsibility of all LSEs within the CAISO. Looking ahead, the Utility expects its GHG-free energy supply mix of
renewable, large hydroelectric, and nuclear generation resources to decrease as, beginning in 2023, the Utility is required to offer for allocation or sale
renewables portfolio standard-eligible (“RPS”) attributes that the Utility procured on behalf of customers that subsequently switched to non-Utility providers in
order to comply with regulatory mandates and to manage customer affordability. Towards the end of the decade and beyond, the Utility’s GHG-free energy
supply mix is expected to grow relative to 2025 levels as the Utility procures new GHG-free generation and storage to meet California’s IRP GHG emissions
reduction targets and California’s clean energy goals. For more information, see “Electric Integrated Resource Planning and Related Procurement” below.
Prosperity
The prosperity element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to meeting their financial objectives and
providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities they serve. Management believes clean energy should be affordable for and
inclusive of all economic backgrounds.
Under cost-of-service ratemaking, a utility’s earnings depend on the outcomes of its ratemaking proceedings and its ability to manage costs.
See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” below and “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC and FERC proceedings.
Generally, differences between forecast costs and actual costs (discussed in “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Results of Operations in
Item 7. MD&A) can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the cost of labor and materials.
Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to taking steps to improve their credit ratings and metrics over time, including by reducing their debt. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility have set goals to reduce their debt over time, including reducing PG&E Corporation’s debt by at least $2 billion by the end of 2026.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that reducing the consolidated debt will help them achieve investment grade credit ratings for their unsecured
securities, for the benefit of both customers and investors. For more information, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Pursuant to SB 901, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to recover $7.5 billion of 2017
wildfire claims costs, which was approved by the CPUC on February 28, 2022. PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, a bankruptcy remote, limited liability
company wholly owned by the Utility, issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds on May 10, 2022 and $3.9 billion
aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds on July 20, 2022. The net proceeds from both transactions were used to reimburse the Utility for
previously incurred recovery costs, including the retirement of $5.0 billion of Utility debt and the repayment of a portion of the loans outstanding under the
Utility's revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. The Utility intends to use a portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the
redemption of $1.0 billion of Utility debt. For more information, see “Application for Post-Emergence Securitization Transaction” in Item 7. MD&A.
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s common stock, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to issue dividends is subject to restrictions. On
February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock. On June
15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility also reinstated the dividend on the Utility’s common stock. For more information, see “Dividends” in Item 7.
MD&A.
Total capital expenditures (including accruals) recorded in 2022 were $9.6 billion. The Utility’s total capital expenditures (including accruals) are forecasted to
be between $7.9 billion and $11.2 billion for 2023, between $7.9 billion and $12.2 billion for 2024, between $8.0 billion and $12.7 billion for 2025, between
$8.1 billion and $13.3 billion for 2026, and between $8.1 billion and $13.8 billion for 2027. The completion of projects, the timing of expenditures, and the
associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials,
financing, legal and regulatory approvals and developments, community requests or protests, weather, and other unforeseen conditions.
14
The Utility expects to make additional capital expenditures, the recovery of which will be subject to future regulatory approval, including the 2023 GRC. These
expenditures include capital expenditures exceeding amounts authorized in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S, and expenditures to be included in a later stage of
the 2023 GRC or separate applications. These expenditures are expected to primarily be for wildfire mitigation, transportation electrification, and the Lakeside
Building. Additionally, $3.21 billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditures will be excluded from the Utility’s equity rate base pursuant to AB 1054.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to keeping gas and electric services affordable for all customers. The Utility’s capital investment plan,
increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, and the cumulative impact of other public policy
requirements collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. Certain CPUC proceedings could impact different types of customers
differently. Similarly, although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as “pass-through” costs, commodity
prices rose substantially in 2022, relative to 2021. The Utility has set a goal to increase customer capital investments while also limiting customer impacts,
including by reducing non-fuel Operating and maintenance costs by two percent per year and by seeking efficient financing. The Utility plans to meet its two
percent non-fuel Operating and maintenance cost reduction goal through increased efficiency, including waste elimination through the Lean operating system.
The Utility has a number of programs in place to assist low-income customers, such as the CARE program. Under the CARE program, income-qualified
customers can receive a monthly discount of 20% or more on their gas and electric bill.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Corporate Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes the companies’ progress toward world-class
performance measured with the triple bottom line framework.
In 2021, the Utility spent $4.01 billion with certified diverse suppliers, representing 38.7% of its total spend.
Performance: Underpinning the Triple Bottom Line
PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the Lean operating system, which includes four basic “plays:” visual management; operating reviews; problem solving;
and standard work. Visual management allows teams to see how they are performing against their most important metrics using real-time data. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility hold daily, weekly, and monthly operating reviews designed to align the performance of workers closest to the work with the goals
and objectives of senior leadership. These brief meetings help the Utility identify gaps and quickly develop plans to support the teams performing the work and
give the Utility more visibility, control and predictability in its operations. Problem solving involves a structured approach to identifying, containing, analyzing,
and solving problems in order to capitalize on opportunities. Standard work reduces costs and increases productivity by ensuring a consistent company-wide
method for completing a task. For instance, the Lean operating system helped the Utility identify patterns in the conditions of ignitions and led to the
implementation of EPSS and drove significant benefit and understanding in how PG&E Corporation and the Utility manage customer satisfaction. PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s performance is also driven by an increased focus on alignment on shared outcomes among its leadership and within the
organization. In 2023, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Lean deployment will focus on a fifth play, waste elimination, which enables the companies to
identify and eliminate inefficiencies in both process and workflow in a sustainable manner, as well as the continued adoption of a performance playbook and
improvements to financial visibility and controls.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have implemented a regional service model to bring the Utility closer to the hometowns it serves. Through the regional
service model, the Utility has restructured its service area into five regions, with leaders in each region to deliver improved public and employee safety,
customer service, and operational reliability outcomes.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to designing an electric system that is resilient to climate change, decarbonized, and optimized to local and
system needs.
California has experienced unprecedented weather conditions in recent years and the Utility’s service area remains susceptible to additional wildfire activity. In
response, the Utility has implemented operational changes and investments that reduce wildfire risk, including:
•Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings: EPSS adjusts the sensitivity of circuit protection devices on selected power lines to de-energize them more
rapidly in the event of a disturbance to help prevent potential ignitions. After EPSS was initiated, both the size and number of CPUC-reportable
ignitions were reduced substantially on EPSS-enabled circuits, compared to the prior three-year average.
15
•Public Safety Power Shutoffs: The PSPS program proactively de-energizes power lines in response to forecasted weather conditions. Since its
inception in late 2017, the PSPS program has become more targeted because the Utility has developed more granular risk models, including adding
consideration of vegetation management and maintenance tag statuses for scoping PSPS events. The Utility has also installed sectionalizers for more
targeted de-energizations of circuits and transmission lines. In 2022, the Utility did not have any PSPS events.
•Vegetation management: The Utility inspects its overhead electric distribution and transmission facilities on an annual basis to identify and clear
vegetation that might grow or fall into utility equipment. The Utility is also increasing oversight and engagement with the contractors supporting
vegetation management work.
•Asset inspections: Since 2018, the Utility has reoriented its asset inspections programs toward asset condition and consequence risk, particularly
wildfire risk, and these programs have become more thorough, standardized, digitized, and verifiable. The Utility uses risk-informed inspection
cycles. In 2022, the Utility continued to refine its risk modeling, including further incorporating data from asset inspections. As a result of the
improved inspection program, the Utility’s inspections in recent years have begun to more thoroughly identify equipment conditions.
•System hardening: System hardening entails repairing, replacing, or eliminating existing power lines in HFTDs and installing stronger and more
resilient equipment. As the Utility’s asset inspections have identified more equipment conditions, the Utility has hardened its system by correcting
significantly more equipment conditions than in prior years. Hardening methods include replacing bare overhead conductor with covered conductor
and installing stronger poles, removing lines, and serving customers through remote grids, or converting lines from overhead to underground. In 2021,
the Utility announced a program to underground 10,000 miles of electric distribution lines in high wildfire risk areas. In 2022, the Utility
undergrounded 180 miles of lines, which exceeded its plan to underground 175 miles of lines. Undergrounding can substantially reduce ignition risk
and improve reliability during storms or periods of high wildfire risk. The Utility also brought online two additional “remote grids” in 2022, which
allow distribution lines in HFTDs to be removed and replaced with locally sited resources. Remote grids can reduce costs and fire risks, while
maintaining service to participating customers.
As a result of these measures, the Utility significantly reduced both the size and number of CPUC-reportable ignitions and number of acres burned in 2022,
compared to prior years.
Even as the Utility works to mitigate wildfire risk, it also works to reduce the impact of those mitigations on its customers, including making the PSPS program
less disruptive through sectionalizing devices for both distribution and transmission lines, temporary generation applications, and implementation of microgrids
which enable portions of the grid to safely isolate areas from the broader grid and energize them during outages. For example, in 2022, the Utility prepared 12
distribution microgrids to operate with temporary generation if needed.
In 2022, the Utility expanded the EPSS program to all high fire risk areas. In addition, the Utility uses multiple weather models on a daily basis that indicate
which circuits to enable with safety settings and which to put in normal protection settings, optimizing for maximum wildfire ignition risk reduction when
needed and enhancing reliability benefits when wildfire risk is low. In 2022, the Utility also began reviewing and adjusting settings to improve coordination
among devices on a circuit to reduce the number of customers impacted by an outage. In 2023, the Utility will expand its deployment of advanced technology
to detect low-current faults, which is expected to further decrease wildfire ignition risk.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are continuing to invest in a safe and reliable gas system and are working toward targeted electrification, greening the gas
supply, and shaping California energy policy. The Utility has focused on continuously improving its gas operations safety record. Since the San Bruno natural
gas pipeline explosion in 2010, the Utility’s asset safety efforts have included replacing distribution mains and transmission pipelines, as well as strength
testing transmission pipelines. The Utility uses in-line inspections to assess the integrity of transmission pipelines. The Utility also uses safety and control
systems to monitor, gather, and process real-time data on its gas system. In 2022, the Utility’s gas operations had two workforce serious injuries and fatalities
(“SIF-A”) incidents and reductions in the number of injuries that result in days away, restricted or transferred duty per 200,000 hours worked (“DART”). The
Utility’s gas system has not had a safety-related incident that affected the public and resulted in a fatality or injury since 2015 or 2018, respectively.
16
The Utility has engaged in educating employees, contractors, and the public regarding safe digging programs and practices for their awareness during
construction and when digging near the Utility’s underground gas and electric assets. The Utility also installed safety devices that automatically detect
increasing pressure on systems and stop the flow of gas to avoid outages and overpressure events. Additionally, the Utility continues to streamline its efforts to
respond to outages on a timely basis. The Utility’s outage response is designed to keep the public safe while limiting customer outages and returning service
safely and as quickly as possible.
The Utility’s generation operations have focused on safety and reliability. In 2022, the Utility’s nuclear and non-nuclear generation operations achieved zero
SIF-A incidents and reductions in DART. Challenged by a drought year, the Utility scheduled dispatch and rescheduled outages to maximize availability during
the summer months when demand for electricity is highest. The Utility is working to implement a comprehensive non-nuclear generation asset management
strategy and further mature its outage and project management capabilities.
In 2022, the Utility achieved International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 55001 certification for its electric operations and generation asset
management systems. The Utility also achieved ISO 55001 re-certification for its gas operations asset management. ISO 55001 certification required the Utility
to demonstrate that it has policies and procedures to manage its assets responsibly and effectively.
Regulatory Environment 
The Utility’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. At the state level, the Utility is regulated
primarily by the CPUC. At the federal level, the Utility is regulated primarily by the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements of other
federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including with respect to safety, the environment, and health, such as the NTSB and OEIS.
This section and the “Environmental Regulation” and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms” sections below summarize some of the more significant laws, regulations,
and regulatory proceedings affecting the Utility. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.
PG&E Corporation is a “public utility holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory
oversight by the FERC. PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries are exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other
than the obligation to provide access to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.
California Public Utilities Commission
The CPUC is a regulatory agency that regulates privately owned public utilities in California. The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and
conditions of service for the Utility’s electric and natural gas distribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services. The
CPUC has also exercised jurisdiction over the Utility’s issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the
Utility’s electric and natural gas retail customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of
facilities used in providing electric and natural gas utility service.
The CPUC enforces state laws and regulations that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of
utility gas and electric facilities.  The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $100,000 per day, per violation. The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the
amount of penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations, the type of harm caused by the violations
and the number of persons affected, and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC
also is required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.
The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issue citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports.
Under the current gas and electric citation programs adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each
violation; but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it has the authority to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $100,000 per day, with an administrative
limit of $8 million per citation issued. Similar to penalties imposed by the CPUC, penalty payments for citations issued pursuant to the gas and electric safety
citation programs are the responsibility of shareholders of an issuer and may not be recovered in rates or otherwise directly or indirectly charged to customers.
The CPUC has also authorized the SED to propose for CPUC approval administrative consent orders and administrative enforcement orders when the SED
deems a formal OII unnecessary.
17
The California State Legislature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to wildfires and wildfire cost recovery,
increasing renewable energy resources, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of
GHG emissions, the establishment of energy storage procurement targets, and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The
CPUC is responsible for approving funding and administration of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer
programs. The CPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Utility’s accounting, performance, and compliance with regulatory guidelines.
The CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financial
conditions that require PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and
prudent to meet the Utility’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. For more information on specific CPUC enforcement
matters and CPUC-implemented laws and policies and the related impact on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, and “Regulatory

operation of the Utility’s business and to conduct certain related operations. The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties
that permit the Utility to install, operate, and maintain the Utility’s electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highways. In exchange for the right
to use public streets and highways, the Utility pays annual fees to the cities and counties. In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an
indeterminate term, with no expiration date. For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Material Effects of Compliance with Governmental Regulations
As indicated above, the Utility’s business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. Compliance with
such extensive government regulations requires substantial expenditures and has had in the past and may continue to have in the future a material effect on
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and competitive position. For more information about
costs incurred to comply with government regulations and related material effects on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, see Item 1A. Risk Factors,
“Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A, and Notes 15 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Environmental Regulation
The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and
health of the Utility’s personnel and the public. These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and
radioactive substances; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of CO and other GHG emissions; the transportation,
handling, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The
penalties for violation of these laws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions. These laws and
requirements also may require the Utility, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Generally, the Utility
recovers most of the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations through the Utility’s rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental
costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 16 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Hazardous Substance Compliance and Remediation
The Utility’s facilities are subject to various regulations adopted by the EPA, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted by other federal agencies
responsible for implementing federal environmental laws. The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted by the State of
California and various state and local agencies. These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1) owner or
operator of the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in some
cases, their corporate successors. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, these persons (known as “potentially
responsible parties”) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harm caused to
natural resources, and paying for the costs of health studies.2
19
The Utility has a comprehensive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Under federal and California laws, the
Utility may be responsible for remediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site. The Utility’s remediation activities
are overseen by the DTSC, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies. The Utility has incurred
significant environmental remediation liabilities associated with former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gas compressor
stations are located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances. Groundwater at the Utility’s
Hinkley and Topock natural gas compressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices. The Utility is
responsible for remediating this groundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.
For more information about environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Air Quality and Climate Change
The Utility’s electric generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws,
including the federal Clean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes. These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to the
formation of ground-level ozone, carbon dioxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO), nitrogen oxides (NO), particulate matter, and other emissions.
Federal Regulation
At the federal level, the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act. Although there have been several legislative attempts to
address climate change through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted. In
the absence of federal legislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.
Tackling the climate crisis is a key priority of the Biden Administration, and the Administration has signaled its intent to use its executive and regulatory
authorities to reduce emissions in line with science-based targets. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the EPA to consider
suspending, revising or rescinding the Trump Administration’s rule for methane emissions from new sources in the oil and gas sector and propose a companion
regulation for existing sources, including the transmission, processing and storage segments of the industry. For power plants, the EPA is expected to propose a
more stringent GHG standard for existing sources in the wake of challenges to the Trump Administration’s Affordable Clean Energy rule.
State Regulation
California’s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 originally provided for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The
CARB has approved various regulations to achieve the 2020 target, including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade
program that sets gradually declining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors
of the economy.
The cap-and-trade program applies to the electric generation, large industrial, natural gas, petroleum, and transportation sectors. The Utility’s compliance
obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of natural gas delivered to the Utility’s customers other than
large natural gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own compliance obligation.
The cap-and-trade program has been extended through 2030. During each year of the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., the rights to emit
GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowed for that year. Entities with a compliance obligation can obtain allowances from the CARB at quarterly
auctions or from third parties or exchanges. Complying entities may also satisfy a portion of their compliance obligation through the purchase of offset credits
(e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties, such as landowners, livestock owners, and farmers, that occur outside of the entities’ facilities
through CARB-qualified offset projects such as reforestation or biomass projects). The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-
trade program to be passed through to customers.2 2 x
20
California law requires that the CARB ensure a 40% reduction in GHGs by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The California RPS program that requires utilities to
gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHG emissions in California. California’s RPS
targets are 50% by December 31, 2026 and 60% by December 31, 2030, and the State has set a policy of meeting 100% of retail sales from eligible renewables
and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. In 2022, AB 1279 was signed into law, codifying a statewide goal to achieve economy-wide carbon
neutrality by 2045 and to maintain net negative emissions thereafter. Additionally in 2022, SB 1020 established targets that renewable and zero-carbon
resources will supply 90% of utilities’ retail sales to customers by 2035 and 95% of retail sales by 2040. The Utility will be an active participant in regulatory
proceedings to determine how the state will achieve carbon neutrality. For the percentage of the Utility’s estimated total net deliveries of electricity to
customers in 2022, including estimated GHG-free and renewable energy percentages, see “Electric Utility Operations-Electricity Resources” below.
Climate Change Resilience Strategies
Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions
During 2022, the Utility continued its programs to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment,
consistent with the Utility’s commitment to a healthy environment and carbon neutral-energy system for all Californians.
Adapting to the Physical Impacts of Climate Change
Effectively managing physical climate risk will become increasingly critical as the physical impacts of climate change become increasingly frequent and severe
over the coming years in California. The Utility’s climate resilience efforts continue to focus on characterizing and mitigating the physical impacts of climate
change to the Utility’s infrastructure, assets, and operations. The Utility is making substantial investments to build a more resilient system that can better
withstand extreme weather and related emergencies. For more information on such investments, see “Performance: Underpinning the Triple Bottom Line”
above.
The Utility’s preparations for the physical risks of climate change include an updated, more detailed, system ‑ wide CVA of the Utility’s assets, operations, and
services, which will be completed in 2024 and filed with the CPUC. The updated CVA will improve the Utility’s understanding of its exposure to climate
hazards in the near- and long-term and the sensitivity of assets and operations to these hazards. It will also inform the Utility’s understanding of the ease or
difficulty of various options for adapting to changing conditions.
In the past few years, the Utility’s electric distribution system has experienced multiple major outage-causing events associated with extreme heat events and
peak loads. Peak loads are expected to increase with increasing temperatures due to direct impacts of ambient temperatures on equipment and direct impacts on
electricity demand driven by rising air conditioning installation and usage.
The Utility’s assets on the coast and in or near watersheds face potential increased exposures to coastal, riverine (fluvial), and precipitation related (pluvial)
flooding because of climate ‑ driven changes in precipitation and sea level rise. The risk of damage to or interruptions of operations at facilities such as
substations is predicted to increase over time due to sea level rise. Electric and gas equipment and safe access for operations must be prepared for these
changing conditions.
Changing precipitation dynamics may impact the Utility’s hydroelectric generation. Diminishing future water availability and altered runoff timing during
extreme drought poses risks to hydropower generation, operations, and revenue. Also, extreme rain events suggest enhanced risk of hydropower asset damage
or failure associated with flooding, which in the worst cases (e.g., uncontrolled water release) may have catastrophic impacts.
Climate change will also continue to intensify the potential for wildfires throughout California. Models incorporating future temperature and precipitation
projections suggest that landscape susceptibility to wildfire within the Utility’s service area will continue to increase over time, with an expansion of areas that
may become HFTD and an intensification of risk within HFTDs. Climate change may also result in increased potential of lines to cause ignitions or to require
PSPS events, as well as the potential for the Utility’s equipment to sustain damage from wildfires of any origin.
The Utility’s updated CVA will be used to inform changes to design and construction standards for equipment and facilities to increase infrastructure resilience
to current and future extreme weather conditions. Results from the updated CVA will be incorporated into the Utility’s key risk and planning functions, as well
as asset management strategy, to identify priority adaptive actions.
21
The Utility is also engaging with CPUC-designated disadvantaged and vulnerable communities throughout the CVA process to ensure that customer
perspectives regarding energy system resilience are part of updating the CVA. The Utility is conducting regional community engagement campaigns throughout
its service area to understand how some of the most vulnerable communities the Utility serves think about climate hazards and adaptation. This information
will help the Utility plan adaptive climate action aligned with customer and community perspectives.
In addition to updating the CVA, the Utility regularly reviews relevant scientific literature regarding climate change to incorporate appropriate information into
its operations. For example, based on a recent report about potential major atmospheric river events, the Utility updated and modified its flooding emergency
response plan.
The Utility’s commitment to increasing resilience to climate change includes aligning its resources and business strategy with California’s clean energy goals,
the Utility’s climate strategy, and advocating for policies and programs that enable safe and reliable energy for the Utility’s customers in light of climate
change. For example, the Utility believes its strategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demand response programs, infrastructure
improvements, and the use of renewable energy and energy storage will help it adapt to the expected increases in demand for electricity.
Emissions Data
PG&E Corporation and the Utility track and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas. The Utility reports its
GHG emissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a voluntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The
Climate Registry, a non-profit organization. The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2021, which is the
most recent data available, totaled Scope 1 and 2 emissions of approximately 4.6 million metric tons of CO equivalent (MMT COe) and Scope 3 emissions of
approximately 42 MMT COe, the majority of which came from customer natural gas use.
The following table shows the 2021 GHG emissions data the Utility reported to the CARB, which is the most recent data available. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility also publish additional GHG emissions data in their annual Corporate Sustainability Report.
Source Amount (metric tons COequivalent)
Fossil fuel-fired plants 2,485,379 
Natural gas compressor stations and storage facilities 322,047 
Distribution fugitive natural gas emissions 589,343 
Customer natural gas use 41,563,483 
Includes nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the Utility’s generating stations.
Includes emissions from compressor stations and storage facilities that are reportable to CARB.
Includes emissions from the combustion of natural gas delivered to all entities on the Utility’s distribution system, with the exception of gas delivered to other natural gas local distribution
companies.
The Utility utilized the CEC’s Power Source Disclosure program methodology to calculate the CO emissions rate associated with the electricity delivered to
retail customers in 2021. This resulted in a third-party verified CO emissions rate of 99 pounds of CO per MWh.
Air Emissions Data for Utility-Owned Generation
In addition to GHG emissions data provided above, the table below sets forth information about the air emissions from the Utility’s owned generation facilities.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publish air emissions data in their annual Corporate Sustainability Report.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal
Nuclear power plant operations produce gaseous, liquid, and solid radioactive wastes, which are covered by federal regulation. High-level radioactive wastes
primarily include used nuclear fuel. Low-level waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools, and equipment
contaminated through use.
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts under
which the DOE would be required to dispose of the utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by
the utilities’ customers. The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nuclear
generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay. As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to
store its spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel. The
Utility and other nuclear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel.
In September 2012, the DOJ and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that provided a claims process by which the Utility submits annual requests for
reimbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.  The claim for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, totaled approximately $10.5 million and is
under review by the DOE.  Amounts reimbursed by DOE are refunded to customers through rates. Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when
and whether the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.
Ratemaking Mechanisms
The Utility operates under a “cost-of-service” ratemaking model, which means that rates for electric and natural gas utility services are generally set at levels
that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service and to earn a return on invested capital (“cost-of-service ratemaking”). In order to
set rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the amount that the Utility will be authorized to collect from its customers (“revenue
requirements”). In the GRC proceedings, the CPUC also generally approves the level of capital spending on a forecasted basis. Revenue authorized by the
CPUC through GRC proceedings is intended to provide the Utility a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its investments in
generation and distribution assets and general plant (also referred to as “rate base”). The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set
to enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation,
and financing expenses).
The Utility’s costs of equity and long-term debt are generally approved in the CPUC’s cost of capital proceedings. In addition, the CPUC authorizes the Utility
to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass through” to customers (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact
Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A), including its costs to procure electricity and natural gas for customers and to administer public purpose and customer programs.
FERC revenue requirements are set through a FERC-approved formula rate.
The Utility’s rate of return on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings. Other than certain gas transmission and storage revenues,
the Utility’s base revenues are “decoupled” from its sales volume through certain regulatory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, that are
designed to allow the Utility to collect its authorized base revenue requirements regardless of sales volume. As a result, the Utility’s base revenues are not
impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from, for example, weather or economic conditions. The Utility’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage
its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue
requirements.
Due to the seasonal nature of the Utility’s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May to October)
because of higher demand, driven by air conditioning loads.  Customer bills related to gas service are generally higher during winter months (November to
March) because of higher demand due to heating.
From time to time, the CPUC may use incentive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn additional revenues. For example, the
Utility has earned incentives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.
See “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC proceedings.
23
Base Revenues
General Rate Cases
The GRC is the primary proceeding in which the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect from
customers to recover the Utility’s anticipated costs related to its electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and Utility-owned electric generation operations
and return on rate base. In the past, the CPUC has generally conducted a GRC every three years. Starting with the 2023 GRC, the CPUC now conducts a GRC
every four years that includes the Utility’s costs of its gas transmission and storage facilities. The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first
year (or “test year”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the
GRC period (known as “attrition years”). Attrition year rate adjustments are generally authorized for cost increases related to invested capital and inflation.
Parties in the Utility’s GRC include the Public Advocates Office of the CPUC (formerly known as Office of Ratepayer Advocates or ORA) and TURN, which
generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as numerous intervenors that represent other business, community, customer,
environmental, and union interests. For more information about the Utility’s GRC, see “Regulatory Matters - 2023 General Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A.
Cost of Capital Proceedings
The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of capital proceeding to authorize the Utility’s capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric
and natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base. The CPUC’s cost of capital proceedings generally take place in a consolidated
proceeding with California’s other large investor-owned electric and gas utilities. For more information about the cost of capital proceedings, see “Regulatory
Matters - Cost of Capital Proceedings” in Item 7. MD&A.
Electricity Transmission Owner Rate Cases
The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in
rates in the TO rate case. In its TO rate cases, the Utility uses a formula rate methodology, which includes an authorized revenue requirement and rate base for a
given year but also provides for an annual update of the previous year’s revenue requirement and rates in accordance with the terms of the FERC-approved
formula. Under the formula rate mechanism, transmission revenue requirements are updated to the actual cost of service annually as part of the true-up process.
Differences between amounts collected and determined under the formula rate are either collected from or refunded to customers. The FERC-approved formula
rate will be effective through December 31, 2023. These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in the Utility’s retail electric rates and by the CAISO
in its transmission access charges to wholesale customers. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in Item 7.
MD&A. The Utility also recovers a portion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific
contracts with wholesale transmission customers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations. These wholesale customers are charged
individualized rates based on the terms of their contracts.
Program-Specific Memorandum Account and Balancing Account Costs
Periodically, costs arise outside of the CPUC GRC proceedings or that have been deliberately excluded therefrom. These costs may result from catastrophic
events, changes in regulation, new programs, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a
memorandum account, and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed reasonable. For instance, these
accounts allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. Recovery
of the costs tracked in these memorandum accounts in rates requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings for which the Utility may be unable to predict
the outcome. Alternatively, the Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs related to these non-GRC programs in balancing accounts. The CPUC may
authorize recovery of costs tracked in the balancing accounts on either a “one-way” basis, which typically only allows actual costs to be recovered up to a pre-
established cap, or a “two-way” basis, which typically allows actual costs to be recovered, and in some cases subject to further CPUC review. For more
information, see “Regulatory Matters - Cost Recovery Proceedings” in Item 7. MD&A and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8.
24
Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through Costs
Electricity Procurement Costs
California IOUs are responsible for procuring electrical capacity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reserve margins. The utilities are
responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources, including certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet
customer demand according to which resources are the least expensive (i.e., using the principles of “least-cost dispatch”). In addition, the utilities are required
to obtain CPUC approval of their Bundled Procurement Plans (“BPPs”) based on long-term demand forecasts. In October 2015, the CPUC approved the
Utility’s most recent comprehensive BPP. It has been revised since its initial approval, and the revised version will remain in effect, subject to any further
revisions, until superseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan.
California law allows electric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved BPPs without further after-the-fact reasonableness
review by the CPUC. The CPUC may disallow costs associated with electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-
approved plan or if the CPUC determines that the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch. Additionally, the CPUC may disallow the value of
lost generation due to unplanned outages at utility-owned generation facilities.
The Utility recovers its electric procurement costs annually primarily through balancing accounts. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8. Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative instruments,
GHG emissions costs, and generation fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement. The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electric rates
more frequently if the forecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the Energy Resource Recovery Account, net of bundled service customer
Portfolio Allocation Balancing Account balances, exceed five percent of its prior year electric procurement and Utility-owned generation revenues. The CPUC
performs an annual compliance review of the procurement transactions recovered in various balancing accounts, including the Energy Resource Recovery
Account and the Portfolio Allocation Balancing Account.
The CPUC has approved various power purchase agreements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approved
BPP, to meet mandatory renewable energy targets, and to comply with RA requirements. For more information, see “Electric Utility Operations - Electricity
Resources” below as well as Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
The Utility is also responsible, as the central procurement entity (“CPE”) for its distribution service area, for seeking to procure the entire amount of required
local RA on behalf of all CPUC-jurisdictional LSEs in its distribution service area. CPUC decisions grant the Utility, acting as CPE, discretion to defer
procurement of local resources to the CAISO’s backstop mechanisms if bid costs are deemed unreasonably high. The Utility, as the CPE, will not be assessed
fines or penalties for failing to procure resources to meet the local RA requirements and deferring local procurement to the CAISO backstop mechanism, as
long as the CPE exercised reasonable efforts to secure capacity and certain specified requirements are met. In addition, the Utility, as the CPE, has been ordered
or authorized to seek to procure specific local capacity products pursuant to CPUC decisions. In connection with its CPE function, the Utility is responsible for
making compliance demonstrations to the CPUC and the CAISO. The Utility recovers its administrative and procurement costs associated with its CPE
function through a balancing account. Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted administrative costs related to the CPE function and approves a
forecasted revenue requirement associated with the administrative costs. The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the CPE function, including
procurement transactions with terms of five years or less (for which costs incurred in compliance with certain prescribed criteria are deemed reasonable and
pre-approved without further after-the-fact reasonableness review). Procurement transactions with terms exceeding five years are reviewed separately. The
CPUC may disallow costs associated with the CPE function that were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC’s decisions and guidance.
The CPUC has also approved the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (“PCIA”). The PCIA is a cost recovery mechanism to ensure that customers who
switch from the Utility’s bundled service to a non-Utility provider, such as a DA or CCA provider, pay their share of the above market costs associated with
long-term power purchase commitments and Utility-owned generation made on their behalf.
Natural Gas Procurement, Storage, and Transportation Costs
The Utility recovers the cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.
25
The Utility sets the natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the
forecasted costs of natural gas, core pipeline capacity and storage costs. The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as
the cost of derivative instruments for its core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its CPIM described below. The Utility
reflects the difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancing accounts, with
under-collections and over-collections taken into account in subsequent monthly rate changes.
The CPIM protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for its core gas portfolio. Under the CPIM, the Utility’s
natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based benchmark based on a weighted average of published
monthly and daily natural gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas. Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99%
to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered through rates. One-half of the costs above 102% of the benchmark
are recoverable through rates, and the Utility’s customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings resulting from the Utility’s cost of natural gas that is less
than 99% of the benchmark. The Utility retains the remaining amount of these savings as incentive revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas
commodity costs. While this mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural gas, consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected to
materially impact net income.
The Utility incurs transportation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers. These providers
transport natural gas from the points at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern
United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements are governed by the FERC-approved tariffs that
detail rates, rules, and terms of service for the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines. The FERC
approves the United States tariffs that shippers, including the Utility, pay for pipeline service, and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the National
Energy Board, a Canadian regulatory agency. The transportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as
core natural gas procurement costs or as a cost of electricity.
Costs Associated with Public Purpose and Customer Programs
The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utility
customers.  These programs relate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters.
 Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Utility to provide discounted rates for specified types of customers, such as for low-income customers under the
CARE program, which is paid for by the Utility’s other customers.
Nuclear Decommissioning Costs
The Utility’s nuclear power facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay. Nuclear decommissioning requires the
safe removal of nuclear facilities from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of
the property for unrestricted use. Nuclear decommissioning costs are generally collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning
trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of
the Utility’s updated estimated decommissioning costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to
decommission the Utility’s nuclear plants. If the nuclear decommissioning trusts are overfunded, the amount of such overfunding will be returned to customers.
Pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 8325, to the extent the monies available for decommissioning are insufficient to pay for all reasonable and prudent
decommissioning costs, the CPUC must authorize the electric utility to collect these charges from its customers.
For costs related to AROs see “Asset Retirement Obligations” in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
26
Human Capital
Employees and Contractors
As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation had 10 employees and the Utility had approximately 26,000 regular employees. Of the Utility’s regular
employees, approximately 16,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three labor unions: the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245; the Engineers and Scientists of California (“ESC”) IFPTE 20; and the Service Employees International Union
Local 24/7 (“SEIU”). The collective bargaining agreements in effect for the IBEW Local 1245; ESC Local 20; and SEIU, United Service Workers West will
expire on December 31, 2025. The agreements increase wages annually by 3.75% from 2022 through 2025 and maintain current contributions to specified
benefits. The IBEW, ESC, and SEIU represent approximately 62% of the Utility’s employee workforce and support several areas of the Utility’s business,
including gas and electric operations. The Utility enjoys stable and productive relationships with its unions and did not experience any work stoppages in 2022.
PG&E Corporation’s employees are primarily at the executive management level, which experienced significant employee turnover throughout the course of its
Chapter 11 Cases in 2019 and 2020. The Utility generally has a stable workforce, which translated into low voluntary turnover during that period. The Utility’s
turnover rates for 2022 and 2021 were 7.1% and 5.8%, respectively. Approximately 42% of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s employees have a tenure of
more than 10 years, with an average tenure of 11 years. Approximately 19% of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s employees are eligible to retire. (PG&E
Corporation and the Utility define retirement age as 55 years and older.)
The Utility’s contractors and subcontractors include approximately 42,000 individuals from approximately 1,200 contractor companies.
Human Capital Management
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s human capital resource objectives are to build and retain an engaged, well trained, diverse, and equitable workforce.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Boards of Directors are responsible for overseeing management’s development and execution of PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s human capital strategy.
To build employee engagement, the Utility has a variety of both executive-level and employee-led initiatives and programs. PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s executive teams meet regularly to discuss and evaluate the state of employee talent, determine which programs are driving engagement and
performance, and clarify the specific skills, behaviors, and values that should be cultivated. Each year, the Utility honors employees whose work embodies
safety, diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, environmental leadership, and community service. The Utility conducts an annual employee engagement survey
to measure and improve employee engagement progress.
Every year, PG&E Corporation and the Utility offer or require technical, leadership, and employee training, which includes a range of technical training for
employees on the knowledge and skills required to perform their jobs safely using approved tools and work procedures. In addition, employees are required to
complete an annual compliance and ethics training and a Code of Conduct training, both of which are intended to promote a culture in which employees are
encouraged to speak up with any concerns or ideas for continuous improvement. In addition, the Utility offers a variety of other trainings and education
opportunities.
Among other programs, the Utility provides career opportunities through its PowerPathway™ workforce development program. Launched in 2008,
PowerPathway is a workforce development model to enlarge the talent pool of local, qualified, diverse candidates for skilled craft and utility industry jobs
through training program partnerships with educational, community-based and government organizations. PowerPathway helps people throughout the Utility’s
service area, including women and military veterans, prepare and compete for high demand jobs in the utility and energy industry. Students receive
approximately eight weeks of industry-informed curriculum to ensure the academic, job specific, employability skills and physical training necessary to
effectively compete for entry-level employment. Programs may also include hands-on training and on-the-job training.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility also provide integrated solutions and programs that cover employee health and wellness and that encompass physical,
emotional, and financial health, including an on-site health clinic, an annual health screening, and health management tools and resources, in addition to more
traditional programs.
27
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial incentives offered to employees include a Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”), an at-risk part of employee
compensation designed to reward eligible employees for achieving specific performance goals. The 2022 STIP was focused on company objectives of safety,
customer impact, and financial health.
All PG&E Corporation and Utility officer compensation currently is funded by shareholders.
Safety
The Utility’s strategy to deliver on safety outcomes focuses on workforce, and public safety. In 2023, in addition to deploying the safety management system,
the Utility targets mitigations to the highest risk work. The Utility’s safety metrics include the number of SIF-A incidents and the SIF-P rate, which measures
events that could have resulted in a SIF-A per 200,000 hours worked. In 2022, the Utility had seven SIF-A incidents, which resulted in three fatalities and four
serious injuries, and a SIF-P rate of 0.11. Additionally, the Utility measures DART. In 2022, the Utility’s DART was 0.67, which was 34% lower than in 2021
and its lowest rate in the past five years.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have continued to monitor activities at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the World Health Organization. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have updated their protocols and actions in accordance with guidance from
these organizations, following state and local health and safety regulations, and in consultation with the Utility’s medical director. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility have also remained focused on protecting the health and safety of their employees, contractors and the Utility’s customers, while continuing to perform
critical utility work, and have continued to monitor and track the impact of the pandemic, modifying or adopting new policies in support of their employees’
health and safety as pandemic conditions and governmental response have changed.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s goal is to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment that enables all of their coworkers to bring their best
selves to work so that they can provide exceptional customer service. These efforts are led by PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Executive Vice President,
People, Shared Services and Supply Chain, with support from the executive team. The People and Compensation Committee of PG&E Corporation’s Board of
Directors reviews the companies’ diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging practices and performance.
Key elements of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s approach include active programming to heighten cultural competency, encourage understanding and
appreciation of diversity, and integrate thoughtful content into training and performance support materials.
Additionally, the Utility’s 11 Employee Resource Groups and three Engineering Network Groups execute enterprise-wide available programming, certain
coworkers lead efforts within their departments, and other specialized teams facilitate dialogue across the companies. These efforts foster employee belonging
and support an environment of inclusion that values and respects diversity in the workforce.
In 2022, women, minorities, and military veterans accounted for approximately 26%, 49% and 7%, respectively, of total PG&E Corporation and Utility
employees. Approximately 8% of the Utility’s employees are younger than 30, 62% are between the ages of 30 and 49, and 30% are 50 or older.
Electric Utility Operations
The Utility generates electricity and provides electric transmission and distribution services throughout its service area in northern and central California to
residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers. The Utility provides electricity, transmission and distribution services in its service area.
Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generation resources, such as rooftop solar
installations. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.
Electricity Resources
The Utility is required to maintain adequate capacity to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and operating
reserves, deliverable to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service. The Utility is responsible for scheduling and bidding
electric generation resources, including certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand.
28
The following table shows the percentage of the Utility’s estimated total net deliveries of electricity to customers in 2022 represented by each major electric
resource, and further discussed below. The Utility’s deliveries were primarily from renewable energy resources that qualify under California’s RPS and other
GHG-free resources (i.e., nuclear, and large hydroelectric generation). California’s RPS requirements and SB 100 goal to serve 100% of retail electricity sales
with GHG-free resources by 2045 are discussed further below and in the Environmental Regulation section above.
The total estimated electricity generated, procured, and sold (net), as of December 31, 2022 was 30,307 GWhand comprised of the following:
Percent of customer retail

TOTAL 100 % — % 100 %
Total renewable energy resources 40 % — % 40 %
GHG-free resources 96 % — % 96 %
This amount excludes electricity provided by DA providers and CCAs that procure their own supplies of electricity for their respective customers.
The allocation of “Others, net” in the “CEC Reporting Methodology Reduction” and “Power Content Label” columns is consistent with CEC guidelines, applied to specified electric generation and
procurement volumes (i.e., fossil fuel-fired, nuclear, large hydroelectric, and renewable). Total reported generation and procurement volumes equate to actual electric retail sales.
Amounts include biopower (e.g., biogas, biomass), solar, wind, certain hydroelectric (i.e., 30MW or less), and geothermal facilities. The eligible renewable percentages above do not reflect RPS
compliance, which is determined using a different methodology.
Amounts consist primarily of natural gas facilities.
Amount is mainly comprised of net CAISO open market (sales)/purchases.
Amount is comprised of renewable, nuclear, and large hydroelectric facility resources generated, procured, and sold.
Renewable Energy Resources
California law established an RPS that requires LSEs, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to their customers.
SB 350 increased the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most LSEs, including the Utility, to their customers from 33% of their total annual
retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028-2030 compliance period, and in each
three-year compliance period thereafter, unless changed by legislative action. SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waiver mechanisms, including
increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance periods. In September 2018, the California
Governor signed SB 100 into law, increasing from 50% to 60% of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030; and established
state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from RPS-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. The Utility may in the future incur
additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable through rates
as “pass-through” costs. The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets. (1)

Renewable generation resources, for purposes of the RPS requirements, include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW
or less), wind, solar, and geothermal energy. RPS requirements are based on procurement, which aligns with the methodology presented in the first column of
the table above. Procurement from renewable energy sources was estimated to comprise 40% of total annual retail sales in 2022.
The estimated total renewable deliveries as of December 31, 2022, shown above was 12,163 GWh and comprised of the following:
TypePercent of Customer Retail Sales (estimated
procurement) 
Biopower 5 %
Geothermal — %
RPS-Eligible Small Hydroelectric 2 %
Solar 24 %
Wind 9 %
Total 40 %
Estimated renewable procurement amounts are expected to be consistent with Power Content Label reporting and adjustments, based on current CEC guidelines.
Estimated renewable procurement percentages above and renewable compliance percentages are expected to be consistent; however, final RPS compliance reporting is subject to a different
methodology and may result in some differences between the two percentages.
Energy Storage
Energy storage improves system reliability and supports California’s decarbonization goals by integrating increased levels of renewable energy. The CPUC has
established a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, under which the Utility was required to procure 580 MW of qualifying storage capacity by the
end of 2020, with all energy storage projects required to be operational by the end of 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility was on track to meet its
storage goals by the end of 2024.
Additionally, the Utility has been actively procuring energy storage to meet critical reliability needs. The CPUC previously approved more than 1,100 MW of
storage to come online in 2022 and 2023. In January 2022, the Utility also requested CPUC approval for another 1,600 MW of storage to be completed by the
summer of 2024, which would bring the Utility’s total energy storage system capacity to more than 3,330 MW. Finally, the Utility is soliciting 200 MW of
long-duration storage, which is storage with at least eight hours of discharge capacity, to have these resources online between 2026 and 2028.
Owned Generation Facilities
At December 31, 2022, the Utility owned the following generation facilities, all located in California, listed by energy source and further described below:
Generation Type County Location Number of UnitsNet Operating

The Utility’s large photovoltaic facilities are Cantua solar station (20 MW), Five Points solar station (15 MW), Gates solar station (20 MW), Giffen solar station (10 MW), Guernsey solar station
(20 MW), Huron solar station (20 MW), Stroud solar station (20 MW), West Gates solar station (10 MW), and Westside solar station (15 MW). All of these facilities are located in Fresno County,
except for Guernsey solar station, which is located in Kings County.
The Utility has applied to transfer its non-nuclear generation assets to Pacific Generation and potentially sell a minority interest in Pacific Generation. (For
more information, see “Application with Pacific Generation LLC for Approval to Transfer Non-Nuclear Generation Assets” in Item 7. MD&A below.)
Generation Resources from Third Parties
The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance
with its CPUC-approved procurement plan. See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” above. For more information regarding the Utility’s power purchase agreements,
see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Electricity Transmission
As of December 31, 2022, the Utility owned approximately 18,000 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV
to 500 kV. The Utility also operated 33 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 65,000 MVA. The Utility’s electric transmission
system is interconnected with electric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, the Canadian
provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, and parts of Mexico.
Decisions about expansions and maintenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of the Utility’s regulators and the CAISO.
Electricity Distribution
The Utility’s electric distribution network consists of approximately 108,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which, as of December 31, 2022,
approximately 25% are underground and approximately 75% are overhead), 67 transmission switching substations, and 752 distribution substations with a
capacity of approximately 36,000 MVA. The Utility’s distribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution
substations, where equipment reduces the high-voltage transmission voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the
Utility’s customers.
These distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network. Emanating from each substation are primary and
secondary distribution lines connected to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users. In some
cases, the Utility sells electricity from its distribution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity. The Utility operates
electric distribution control center facilities in Concord, Rocklin, and Fresno, California; these control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a
smarter, more resilient grid.(3)

 These amounts represent revenues authorized to be billed.
Natural Gas Utility Operations
The Utility provides natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers
(i.e., industrial, large commercial, and natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service area.  Core
customers can purchase natural gas procurement service (i.e., natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement service
providers (referred to as “core transport agents”).  When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gas
delivery, metering, and billing services to customers.  When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the
combined service as “bundled” natural gas service.  More than 96% of core customers, representing approximately 85% of the annual core market demand,
receive bundled natural gas service from the Utility.
The Utility generally does not provide procurement service to non-core customers, which must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers, unless
the customer is a natural gas-fired generation facility with which the Utility has a power purchase agreement that includes its generation fuel expense. The
Utility offers backbone gas transmission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-
core customers.  Access to the Utility’s backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core
customers.  The Utility also delivers gas to off-system customers (i.e., outside of the Utility’s service area) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.(1)

32
Natural Gas Supplies
The Utility can receive natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains,
and the southwestern United States. The Utility can also receive natural gas from fields in California. The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core
customers directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States. The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of
natural gas purchase contracts have varied generally based on market conditions. During 2022, the Utility purchased approximately 296,000 MMcf of natural
gas (net of the sale of excess supply of gas). Substantially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less. The Utility’s
largest individual supplier represented approximately 47% of the total natural gas volume the Utility purchased during 2022.
Natural Gas System Assets
The Utility owns and operates an integrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California. At
December 31, 2022, the Utility’s natural gas system consisted of approximately 44,000 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6,300 miles of backbone and local
transmission pipelines, and various storage facilities. The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system
and one compressor station on its local transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines. The Utility’s backbone transmission
system is used to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, and California gas fields to the
Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems.
The Utility has firm transportation agreements for the transportation of natural gas from various natural gas supply points and interconnection points to the
Utility’s natural gas transportation system. These agreements provide transportation service from western Canada to the United States-Canada border, from the
United States-Canada border to an interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system at the Oregon-California border, from the U.S.
Rocky Mountains to an interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system at the Oregon-California border, and from supply points in the
southwestern United States to interconnection points with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of California near Topock, Arizona. (For
more information regarding the Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)
The Utility owns and operates three underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to the
Utility’s gas transmission system.  In 2019, the CPUC approved the discontinuation, through closure or sale, of operations at two of the Utility’s owned and
operated gas storage fields, Pleasant Creek and Los Medanos. The Utility expects to sell Pleasant Creek in 2023 in accordance with the CPUC’s final decision
in the 2019 GT&S rate case. The Utility intends to retain the Los Medanos field to further support system supply reliability as proposed in the 2023 GRC. The
Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for storage and later for withdrawal. 
In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility’s Northern California gas transmission system.
In 2022, the Utility continued upgrading transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and substantially completed its work on the final
recommendation from the NTSB’s 2010-11 San Bruno investigation to confirm testing or perform a hydrostatic test for all Class 3 and Class 4 pipelines and all
high consequence pipeline mileage.

 These amounts represent revenues authorized to be billed.
Competition
Trends in Market Demand and Competitive Conditions in the Electricity Industry
The Utility expects customer electric load to increase in coming years primarily as a result of electrification of buildings and transportation. The Utility is not
able to predict how quickly this electrification will occur. The Utility expects customer demand for gas to decrease in the coming years, primarily in response to
policies supporting California’s climate goals.
California law allows qualifying non-residential electric customers of IOUs to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather than from the utilities
up to certain annual limits specified for each utility. This arrangement is known as DA. In addition, California law permits cities, counties, and certain other
public agencies that have qualified to become a CCA to generate or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses. By law, a CCA can procure
electricity for all of its residents and businesses that do not affirmatively elect to continue to receive electricity generated or procured by a utility.
The Utility continues to provide transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to DA customers at the election of their energy service provider. The
CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services from the Utility. In addition to collecting charges for transmission,
distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect charges intended to recover the generation-related costs that the Utility
incurred on behalf of DA and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. The Utility remains the electricity provider of last resort for these
customers. Section 387 of the Public Utilities Code allows for a request to transfer the responsibilities of the provider of last resort obligation from IOUs to
other entities. (1)
 (2)
(1) 
(2)
34
The Utility is also impacted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage. The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers
(primarily solar installations) and customer enrollment in NEM, which allows self-generating customers employing qualifying renewable resources to receive
bill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing, putting upward rate pressure on remaining customers. New NEM customers, as well as customers
interconnecting on the successor to the NEM tariffs, are required to pay an interconnection fee, utilize time of use rates, and are required to pay certain non-
bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay. Significantly higher bills for
remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers or adopt self-generation
technologies. See “Rising rates for the Utility’s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its
authorized ROE” in Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Regulatory Matters - OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs” in Item 7. MD&A.
Further, in some circumstances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts may have authority under the state constitution or state statute to
provide retail electric service directly to consumers. Those entities may rely upon FERC open access tariffs and Utility infrastructure to deliver energy to them
at wholesale rates for resale at retail to existing or potential new Utility customers. These entities may also seek to acquire the Utility’s transmission or
distribution facilities through eminent domain for use in serving electricity at retail to existing or potential new Utility customers. As a result, the Utility could
lose customers (residential, commercial, and industrial) in the municipality. See “Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility’s assets through eminent
domain” in Item 1A. Risk Factors. It is also expected that some publicly-owned utilities will build new or duplicate transmission or distribution facilities to
serve existing or potential new Utility customers. In some instances, microgrid formation is a key factor in a community’s choice to engage governmental
entities.
The effect of such types of retail competition generally is to reduce the number of utility customers, leading to a reduction in the Utility’s rate base.
The Utility also competes for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its service
area through a competitive bidding process managed by the CAISO.
For risks in connection with increasing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Competition in the Natural Gas Industry
The Utility competes with other natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis of
transportation rates, access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services. The Utility also competes
for storage services with other third-party storage providers, primarily in Northern California.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting
estimates described in Item 7. MD&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial
results.  The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read
in conjunction with Item 7. MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” of this 2022 Form 10-K.  Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Risk Factors Summary
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results. These risks are discussed more
fully below.

• The inability of PG&E Corporation to use some or all of its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future income;
• Restrictions on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to issue dividends;
• PG&E Corporation’s reliance on dividends, distributions and other payments from the Utility;
• Restrictions on shareholders’ ability to change the direction or management of PG&E Corporation;
• The COVID-19 pandemic;
36
• Increased customer rates; and
• Inflation.
Risks Related to Wildfires
The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires.
If the Utility does not have an approved WMP, the Utility will not be issued a safety certification and will consequently not benefit from the presumption of
prudency or the AB 1054 disallowance cap. Under AB 1054, the Utility is required to maintain a safety certification issued by the OEIS to be eligible for
certain benefits, including a cap on Wildfire Fund reimbursement and a reformed prudent manager standard. The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund disallowance cap,
which caps the amount of liability that the Utility could be required to bear for a catastrophic wildfire, is inapplicable if the Wildfire Fund administrator
determines that the electric utility company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted “conscious or willful disregard for the
rights and safety of others,” or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time the applicable wildfire ignited. In addition, if
the Utility fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time a wildfire ignites, the initial burden of proof in a prudency proceeding shifts from intervenors
to the Utility. The Utility will be required to reimburse amounts that are determined by the CPUC not to be just and reasonable. For more information on the
disallowance cap, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Furthermore, the Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such
funds could be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utility companies. If the
Utility is unable to maintain an AB 1054 safety certification or if the Wildfire Fund is exhausted, the inability to access the Wildfire Fund could have a material
effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Also, the Utility will not be able to obtain
any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any year that do not exceed the greater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of
insurance coverage required under AB 1054.
The costs of participating in the Wildfire Fund are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the anticipated ten-year contribution period for the fund. The timing and
amount of any potential charges associated with the Utility’s contributions would also depend on various factors. In addition, there could also be a significant
delay between the occurrence of a wildfire and the timing on which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of
data available to the Utility following a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service area of another participating electric utility.
Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh these substantial costs.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or
future wildfires.
Based on the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will
incur losses in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire. Although PG&E Corporation and
the Utility have recorded liabilities for probable losses in connection with these fires, these liability estimates correspond to the lower end of the range of
reasonably estimable losses, do not include several categories of potential damages that are not reasonably estimable, and are subject to change based on new
information.
Although there are a number of unknown facts surrounding Cal Fire’s causation determinations of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie
fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of recoveries that would be expected to have a material impact on
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also received
and have responded or are responding to document, data, and other information requests from the CPUC’s SED, the DOJ, and law enforcement agencies that
are investigating these wildfires. PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions in
connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or other wildfires. For more information, see Note 15
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
37
Criminal charges have been filed against the Utility in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. Under California law (including Penal Code section 1202.4), if the
Utility were convicted of any of the charges, the sentencing court must order the Utility to “make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established
by court order” that is “sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of” the Utility’s underlying
conduct, in addition to interest and the victim’s or victims’ attorneys’ fees. This requirement for full reimbursement of economic loss is not waivable by either
the government or the victims and is not offset by any compensation that the victims have received or may receive from their insurance carriers. If convicted of
any of the charges, the Utility currently believes that its total losses associated with the 2020 Zogg fire could materially exceed the accrued estimated liabilities
that PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded to reflect the lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses. The Utility is unable to
determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of such additional losses. The Utility does not expect that any of its liability insurance would be available to
cover restitution payments ordered by the court presiding over the criminal proceeding.
There have been numerous other wildfires in the Utility’s service area, of which the Utility has not been alleged or determined to be a cause. The Utility could
be alleged or determined to be a cause of one or more of these wildfires.
Additionally, under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, courts have imposed liability against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose
property was damaged through a public-use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited from such undertaking, even if the utility is
unable to recover these costs through rates. In fact, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it
had incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. Legal challenges to that denial were unsuccessful. Plaintiffs have asserted and continue to
assert the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to certain wildfires that occurred in the Utility’s service area. Inverse condemnation imposes
strict liability (including liability for attorneys’ fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities’
electric transmission lines. While the Utility continues to dispute the applicability of inverse condemnation to the Utility, there can be no assurance that the
Utility will be successful in challenging the applicability of inverse condemnation in the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022
Mosquito fire, or other litigation against PG&E Corporation or the Utility.
Although the Utility has taken extensive measures to reduce the threat of future wildfires, the potential that the Utility’s equipment will be involved in the
ignition of future wildfires, including catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including
climate (in particular, extended periods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation
conditions. Despite significant investment in mitigation measures to improve infrastructure and manage vegetation, as well as implementation of de-
energization strategies, the Utility may not be successful in mitigating the risk of future wildfires. Once an ignition has occurred, the Utility is unable to control
the extent of damages. The extent of damages for a wildfire is primarily determined by environmental conditions (including weather and vegetation
conditions), third-party suppression efforts, and the location of the wildfire.
In addition, wildfires have had and could continue to have (as a result of any future wildfires) adverse consequences on the Utility’s proceedings with the
CPUC (including the Safety Culture OII) and the FERC, and future regulatory proceedings, including future applications with the OEIS for the safety
certification required by AB 1054. PG&E Corporation and the Utility may also suffer additional reputational harm and face an even more challenging
operating, political, and regulatory environment as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or any
future wildfires. For more information about the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, see Note 15 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
The Utility may be unable to recover all or a significant portion of its costs in excess of insurance coverage in connection with wildfires, through rates, or
from the Wildfire Fund in a timely manner.
The Utility could incur substantial costs in excess of insurance coverage or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future
in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be
allowed to recover costs in excess of insurance or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future either through FERC TO
rates or as costs recorded to the WEMA, even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of
inverse condemnation. The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through rates or by collecting such rates in a timely
manner could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. For more
information on wildfire recovery risk, see “The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages
arising from catastrophic wildfires” above and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
38
The Utility may not effectively implement its wildfire mitigation initiatives.
The Utility’s infrastructure is aging and poses risks to safety and system reliability. Although the Utility spends significant resources on initiatives designed to
mitigate wildfire risks, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or effective in reducing wildfire-related losses. The Utility will face a
higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its service area if it cannot effectively implement these efforts and its WMPs. For example, the Utility may not be
able to effectively implement its WMPs if it experiences unanticipated difficulties relative to sourcing, engaging, training, overseeing, and retaining contract
workers it needs to fulfill its mitigation obligations under the WMPs. The CPUC will assess penalties on the Utility if there is a finding that the Utility has
failed to substantially comply with its WMPs.
There can be no assurance that the Utility’s wildfire mitigation initiatives will be effective. For instance, a wildfire may be ignited and spread even in
conditions that do not trigger proactive de-energization according to criteria for initiating a PSPS event or where EPSS has been implemented on Utility
equipment. The Utility’s inspections of vegetation near its assets may not detect structural weaknesses within a tree or other issues. If the Utility’s wildfire
mitigation initiatives are not effective, a wildfire could be ignited and spread.
The PSPS program has been subject to significant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators, and lawmakers. The Utility
also is the subject of a class action litigation in connection with the 2019 PSPS events.
In addition, on a risk-informed basis, the Utility is making efforts to reduce the frequency and impacts of PSPS. The Utility may be subject to mandated
changes to, or restrictions on, its operational practices, regulatory fines and penalties, claims for damages, and reputational harm if the Utility does not execute
PSPS in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The Utility establishes the criteria under which it implements PSPS in its territory. To the extent the
Utility’s criteria for implementing PSPS are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires, the Utility does not fully implement PSPS when criteria are met due
to other overriding conditions or the Utility’s regulators mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational PSPS practices, the Utility will
face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory during high-risk weather conditions.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the various proceedings and litigation in connection with its wildfire mitigation
initiatives. PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings, or other enforcement actions as well as to
additional litigation and claims by customers as a result of the Utility’s implementation of its wildfire mitigation initiatives, which could result in fines,
penalties, customer rebates, other payments, or the Utility’s failure to obtain cost recovery for amounts expended on these initiatives. The amount of any fines,
penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits, rebates or other payments in connection with any
other wildfire mitigation initiatives or liability for damages) could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS and EPSS programs have had an adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reputation
with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS events and EPSS outages may increase these negative perceptions. For more information, see
“Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology
The Utility’s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks.
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating
system. See “Electric Utility Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. above. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects
to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation
facilities at the end of their useful operating lives. For more information, see “The operation and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities
expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change
or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire” below.
The Utility’s ability to efficiently construct, maintain, operate, protect, and decommission its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely
and reliably is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility’s control, including those that arise from:
•the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines or other assets
or group of assets, that can cause explosions, fires, public or workforce safety issues, large scale system disruption or other catastrophic events;
39
•an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operating
procedures, or welding or fabrication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets and
uncontained natural gas flow;
•the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled or uncontrolled
gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life;
•a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third
parties;
•the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees, contractors, or the public,
environmental damage, or reputational damage;
•the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;
•the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are
built;
•the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably
should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wildfire or natural gas explosion);
•inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or
extended outages;
•operator or other human error;
•a motor vehicle or aviation incident involving a Utility vehicle or aircraft, respectively (or one operated on behalf of the Utility) resulting in serious
injuries to or fatalities of the workforce or the public, property damage, or other consequences;
•an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;
•construction performed by third parties that damages the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or
“dig-ins” that damage the Utility’s underground pipelines, the risk of which may be exacerbated if the Utility does not have an effective contract
management system;
•the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking
lead-based paint from the Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and
•attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war. For more information, see “The Utility’s operational networks
and information technology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event or physical attack” below.
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies, affect demand for electricity or natural gas, cause unplanned outages or reduce generating
output, damage the Utility’s assets or operations, damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies, damage property owned by
customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore
service, and to compensate third parties. Any such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility.
Further, the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetation
management, or the construction or demolition or facilities, and the Utility may have less control over contractors than its employees. The Utility may retain
liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable
laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death
caused by third-party contractor actions or inactions.
40
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery
under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy.
The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice and state climate policy
supporting a decarbonized economy. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of distributed energy
resources, such as on-site solar generation, electric vehicles, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These
developments will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options,
electric vehicle infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects). The Utility may be unable to effectively adapt to these
potential business and regulatory changes, for instance by failing to meet customer demand for new business interconnections in a timely manner. The CPUC is
also conducting proceedings to evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of
distributed energy resources and consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred
by distributed energy resources, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role
of the electric distribution grid operator. If the Utility is unable to effectively adapt to these potential business and regulatory changes its business model and its
ability to execute on its strategy could be materially impacted.
Various jurisdictions within California have enacted prohibitions or restrictions on use and consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will
reduce the use of natural gas. Reducing natural gas use could lead to a reduction in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a
result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer being “used and useful,” potentially causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded (under
CPUC precedent, when an asset no longer meets the standard of “used and useful,” the asset is removed from rate base, which results in a reduction in
associated rate recovery). However, while natural gas demand is projected to decline over time, the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in
California have been increasing, among other things, to cover the cost of long-term pipeline safety enhancements. Inability by the Utility to recover through
rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas system safety and reliability could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
These industry changes, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the
Utility’s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, and cash flows.
The Utility’s operational networks and information technology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event,
or physical attack.
The Utility’s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and
communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and
physical attacks. Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. federal government, including the
Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in
sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utility’s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the
existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility’s operational networks could cause
harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility’s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy
and gas or otherwise operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties.
41
The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive
information, including the Utility’s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers,
employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals. The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its
systems, and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility’s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of
data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California’s electricity market related to grid
modernization and customer choice. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility’s systems and
information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility’s information technology systems
could impact the Utility’s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.
The Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the
Utility’s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility’s operations.
None of these breaches or attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance
that the Utility will be able to prevent unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its
operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of
applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no assurance that adequate insurance
will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered
by insurance or recoverable through rates.
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities, and the Utility may not be
able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire.
The operation of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health, and financial risks, such as
risks relating to operation of the Diablo Canyon nuclear generation units as well as the storage, handling, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of
radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by
insurance or exceed the amount of insurance coverage available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities
arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.
The Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file
petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear
power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also
possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the
Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before their respective current licenses expire in 2024 and 2025 or prior to the expiration of
any renewed license and extended operations period. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its
unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, and cash flows.
If Diablo Canyon is retired by 2025, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of
operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an
employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and
elsewhere in the Utility. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs.
42
The Utility is pursuing the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030. If Diablo Canyon enters extended operations, the Utility will
face operational challenges resulting from a shortened planning period. For instance, the Utility may be unable to procure an adequate supply of nuclear fuel.
For more information, see “Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations” under “Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” in Item 7. MD&A.
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.
Business above. If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and
cash flows could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner
and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or
decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear generation units before their respective current
licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility’s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $840 million.
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets,
at the end of their useful lives. See “Asset Retirement Obligations” in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8. The Utility’s costs
to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning are subject to reasonableness review by the CPUC. The Utility will be responsible for
any costs that the CPUC determines were not reasonably incurred. If the Utility’s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear
decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could
be materially affected.
The Utility may be unable to attract and retain specialty personnel.
The Utility’s workforce is aging, and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken
efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel in certain specialty
operational positions. Additionally, the Utility could experience labor disruptions from personnel in those positions. If the Utility were to experience such a
shortage or disruptions, work stoppages could occur.
Any such occurrences could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Risks Related to Environmental Factors
Severe weather conditions, extended drought, and climate change could materially affect PG&E Corporation and the Utility.
Extreme weather, drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with many of the other risks facing PG&E Corporation and
the Utility, particularly wildfire management in California. The Utility’s service area encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as
a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought
conditions and extreme heat followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the
likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires, including during the recent wildfire seasons, has increased in
the Utility’s service area as a result of an ongoing extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest, and wildfire fuel increases due to
rising temperatures and record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. As of December 31, 2022, more than
81% of California is experiencing severe to extreme drought. Moderate or severe drought conditions occur and can persist in virtually all of the Utility’s service
area. More than half of the Utility’s service area is in an HFTD. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical
forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. In January 2018, the CPUC approved a
statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of the Utility’s service area is facing “elevated” or “extreme” fire danger. Approximately 25,000
circuit miles of the Utility’s nearly 80,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit
miles are in such HFTDs, significantly more in total than other California IOUs.

Severe weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, extreme heat events, drought, earthquakes,
lightning, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, wind events or other weather-related conditions, climate change, or
natural disasters, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries and loss of life, significant decreases in
revenues and earnings, and significant additional costs to PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could have a material effect on PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any such event also could lead to significant claims against
the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its
customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility’s practices or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility.
Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased severity and frequency of storm events, sea level rise, land subsidence,
change in temperature extremes, changes in precipitation patterns and drought, and wildfire) on its assets, operations, and services, and the Utility is developing
adaptation plans to set forth a strategy for those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Consequences of these climate-driven
events may vary widely and could include increased stress on the energy supply network due to new patterns of demand, reduced hydroelectric output, physical
damage to the Utility’s infrastructure, higher operational costs, and an increase in the number and duration of customer outages and safety consequences for
both employees and customers. As a result, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation could change, and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring
additional generation. If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased
customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, climate hazards such as heatwaves,
windstorms, and flooding caused by rising sea levels and extreme storms could damage the Utility’s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric
transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other
third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the
likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. See “Rising rates for the Utility’s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is
unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE” below.
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a material impact on the Utility’s operations and could result in lower revenues or increased
expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.
The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws, and such laws could change.
The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially
responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can
be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial
ability of other potentially responsible parties. For more information, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, or stricter and
more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of
licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines
or other sanctions.
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these
mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review.
The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future, or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC
has authorized the Utility to recover through rates.
Some of the Utility’s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through
rates or insurance. See “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1. and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Utility’s costs
to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination, changes in estimated costs,
and the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
44
Risks Related to Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process.
The EOEP is a six-step process with potentially escalating CPUC oversight and enforcement measures based on specific “triggering events” identified for each
of the six steps. If the Utility is placed into the EOEP, it will be subject to additional reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight by the
CPUC. Higher steps of the process (steps 3 through 6) also contemplate additional enforcement mechanisms, including appointment of an independent third-
party monitor, appointment of a chief restructuring officer, pursuit of the receivership remedy, and review of the Utility’s Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity (i.e., its license to operate as a utility). The process contains provisions for the Utility to cure and exit the process if it can satisfy specific criteria. The
EOEP states that the Utility should presumptively move through the steps of the process sequentially, but the CPUC may place the Utility into the appropriate
step of the process upon occurrence of a specified triggering event.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be materially affected by legislative and regulatory developments.
The Utility and its operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and orders. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and
other costs associated with compliance with these rules. These rules could change, which could change the Utility’s compliance obligations and the costs to
comply with these rules. Non-compliance with these rules could result in the imposition of material fines on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, other
regulatory exposure, significant litigation, and reputational harm, which could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Wildfire
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Wildfire Fund does
not effectively mitigate the financial risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where the Utility’s facilities are a substantial cause. See
“The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires.” above.
Privacy
In June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring compliance by
January 1, 2019. The State of California announced enacted regulations in August 2020 and March 2021 which provide guidance on the requirements of the
CCPA. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use
and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA
provides for financial penalties in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. On November 3, 2020,
Californians voted to approve Proposition 24, a ballot measure that creates the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which amended and expanded the
CCPA. The State of California enacted the CPRA in November 2020, with most provisions operative as of January 1, 2023 and applicable to personal
information collected beginning January 1, 2022. Final CPRA regulations are in development. Failure to comply with the CCPA and the CPRA could result in
litigation, audits, and the imposition of material fines on PG&E Corporation and the Utility.
Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility collect and retain certain personal information of their customers, shareholders, and employees in connection
with their business. Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility invest in risk management and information security measures, the personal information that
they collect, as well as other commercially-sensitive data that they possess, could become compromised because of certain events, including a cyber incident,
the insufficiency or failure of such measures, human error, the misappropriation of data, or the occurrence of any of the foregoing at any third party with which
PG&E Corporation or the Utility has shared information. If any of these events were to transpire, it could subject PG&E Corporation and the Utility to
financial liability.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to federal and state privacy laws, which grant consumers rights and protections, including, among other things,
the ability to opt out of receiving certain communications and certain data sharing with third parties.
45
Environmental
The environmental rules to which the Utility’s operations are subject relate to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous substances, and the
protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife.
Also, SB 100 (the 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018) increased the percentage from 50% to 60% of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from
renewables by 2030; and established state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from renewable portfolio standard-eligible or carbon-free
resources by 2045. Failure to comply with SB 100 could result in fines imposed on PG&E Corporation and the Utility that could be material.
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations.
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state, and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of
enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in
connection with the Safety Culture OII (as defined in “Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Safety Culture” under
“Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A) and other matters that the CPUC’s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on
any issue it deems appropriate. In addition, OEIS has authority to approve and oversee compliance with the WMP and may determine that the Utility has failed
to substantially comply with its WMP.
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state, or local
laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and RA
requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices;
safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC GOs or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; whether the Utility is able to achieve the
targets in its WMPs; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in
accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds depends on a variety
of factors and could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. See “Risks Related to Wildfires”
above. The Utility is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount
of any costs and expenses associated with such investigations.
If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties, the amount of which could be
substantial, and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these
investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be
subject; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations.
The Utility’s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility’s actual costs could exceed its authorized or
forecasted costs due to various factors, including if the Utility is not able to manage its costs effectively.
The Utility’s financial results depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and equity, and to recover costs from its
customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and the FERC. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results
of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility or if the
amount of actual costs incurred differs from the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates. The outcome of the Utility’s ratemaking proceedings can be
affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the
political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility’s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers,
about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. If the CPUC does not authorize sufficient funding for investments in
the Utility’s infrastructure, it may negatively impact the Utility's ability to modernize the grid and make it resilient to risks related to climate change, including
wildfires.
46
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows
could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility’s ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable
rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time delay between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered through rates. The
CPUC or the FERC may not allow the Utility to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons.
Further, the Utility may be required to incur expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. For example, the Utility has
incurred, and continues to incur, costs to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable
through rates. Also, the CPUC may deny recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility was not
prudent.
The Utility may incur additional costs or receive reduced revenue for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as
wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), increased self-generation by customers, an increase
in distributed generation, lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions, the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers like CCAs or
DA providers, whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively, returning customers, or compliance with new state laws or
policies. See “Trends in Market Demand and Competitive Conditions in the Electricity Industry” in Item 1.
Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility’s assets through eminent domain.
Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility’s assets through eminent domain (“municipalization”). In particular, the City and County of San Francisco
(“San Francisco”) has submitted a petition with the CPUC seeking a valuation of the Utility’s electric assets in San Francisco and has expressed intent to
acquire such assets. While San Francisco would still need to, among other things, initiate and prevail in an eminent domain action in state court to acquire the
Utility’s assets, there is no guarantee that the Utility would be successful in defending against such an action or related regulatory proceeding. If
municipalization proceedings are permitted to move forward and are successful, the Utility would be entitled to receive the fair market value of the assets that
are subject to the takeover effort, but the valuation issues in any municipalization proceeding would be highly contentious and could result in the Utility
receiving less than what it believes is just compensation for the applicable assets. Any assets acquired by a third party through eminent domain would be
excluded from the Utility’s rate base, reducing the Utility’s revenues and opportunity to earn a return on such assets. Assets that are targeted for
municipalization generally are located in geographic areas that have a lower cost of service relative to billed revenues, so municipalization could negatively
impact the affordability of the Utility’s service for remaining Utility customers served outside of those geographic areas. A successful municipalization attempt
could also encourage similar attempts by other municipalities which, if successful, would further divide the Utility’s assets and reduce the Utility’s rate base,
profitability, and affordability for remaining Utility customers. It is also unclear how the CPUC would allocate the compensation received by the Utility for its
assets between shareholders and customers. As a result of these factors, municipalization could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flow.
Risks Related to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Environment and Financial Condition
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s substantial indebtedness may adversely affect their financial health and operating flexibility.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have a substantial amount of indebtedness, most of which is secured by liens on certain assets of PG&E Corporation and the
Utility. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation had approximately $4.68 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness consisting of PG&E
Corporation’s $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due
2030, and borrowings under the $2.75 billion secured term loan agreement entered into in June 2020), and the Utility had approximately $45.6 billion of
outstanding indebtedness. In addition, PG&E Corporation had $500 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Corporation Revolving Credit
Agreement, and the Utility had $1.5 billion of additional borrowing capacity under the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Utility had
outstanding preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $252 million.
Since PG&E Corporation and the Utility have a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations will be used to make payments on this
debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of the Utility’s assets are used to secure its debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future
secured debt or credit support and reduces its flexibility in operating these secured assets. This relatively high level of debt and related security could have
other important consequences for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including:
•limiting their ability or increasing the costs to refinance their indebtedness;
47
•limiting their ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of their business
strategy or other purposes;
•limiting their ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of their business;
•increasing their vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given their
substantial indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, as well as to catastrophic events; and
•limiting their ability to capitalize on business opportunities.
Under the terms of the agreements and indentures governing their respective indebtedness, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are permitted to incur additional
indebtedness, some of which could be secured (subject to compliance with certain tests) and which could further accentuate these risks. As a result of the high
level of indebtedness, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to generate sufficient cash through operations to service such debt, and may need to
refinance such indebtedness at or prior to maturity and be unable to obtain financing on suitable terms or at all. As a capital-intensive company, the Utility
relies on access to the capital markets. If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. The Utility’s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to
refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including the Utility’s levels of indebtedness,
maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. The Utility’s inability to service its
substantial debt or access the financial markets on reasonable terms could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
The documents that govern PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s indebtedness limit their flexibility in operating their business.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s material financing agreements, including certain of their respective credit agreements and indentures, contain various
covenants restricting, among other things, their ability to:
•incur or assume indebtedness or guarantees of indebtedness;
•incur or assume liens;
•sell or dispose of all or substantially all of its property or business;
•merge or consolidate with other companies;
•enter into any sale leaseback transactions; and
•enter into swap agreements.
The restrictions contained in these material financing agreements could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to operate their business and may
limit their ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could
adversely affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to finance their operations and expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, investments, or
alliances, sell assets, restructure their organization, or finance their capital needs. Additionally, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with
these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond their control, including prevailing regulatory, economic, financial and industry conditions.
Parties have appealed the Confirmation Order.
Following entry of the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan, certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order. While a number
of such appeals have been dismissed, there can be no assurance that any of the remaining appeals will not be successful and, if successful, that any such appeal
would not have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
48
PG&E Corporation may be required to issue shares with respect to HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, which would result in dilution to holders of
PG&E Corporation common stock, or pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims.
On the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation issued to the Fire Victim Trust a number of shares of common stock equal to 22.19% of the outstanding common
stock on such date. As further described in “Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims” in Note 15 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&E Corporation may be required to issue shares of its common stock in satisfaction of allowed HoldCo
Rescission or Damage Claims. If such issuance is required, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should receive additional shares of
PG&E Corporation common stock such that it would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&E Corporation on the
Emergence Date, assuming that such issuance of shares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the Emergence Date. Any
such issuances will result in dilution to anyone who holds shares of PG&E Corporation common stock prior to such issuance and may cause the trading price of
PG&E Corporation shares to decline.
Additionally, PG&E Corporation may be required to pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims (as defined in
“Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8). Such payment may have a material adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and
cash flows.
Any substantial sale of stock by existing stockholders could depress the market value of PG&E Corporation’s common stock, thereby devaluing the market
price.
Certain stockholders, including the Fire Victim Trust, received a large number of shares in the Chapter 11 Cases and may continue to hold shares of PG&E
Corporation. PG&E Corporation can make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the
prevailing market price of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock in the public market, or the
perception that such sales could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for such shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for PG&E
Corporation to sell equity securities or equity-linked securities in the future at a time and price which it deems appropriate.
PG&E Corporation may also sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent offerings or issue additional shares of common stock or securities
convertible into shares of PG&E Corporation common stock. The issuance of any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in future financings,
acquisitions upon conversion or exercise of convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of PG&E
Corporation’s outstanding common stock. If PG&E Corporation issues any such additional shares, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate
ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. PG&E Corporation cannot predict the size of future issuances of shares of PG&E Corporation
common stock or securities convertible into shares of PG&E Corporation common stock or, for any issuance, the effect, if any, that such future issuances will
have on the market price of PG&E Corporation’s common stock.
PG&E Corporation common stock is subject to ownership and transfer restrictions intended to preserve PG&E Corporation’s ability to use its net operating
loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.
PG&E Corporation has incurred and may also continue to incur, in connection with the Plan, significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax
attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. The Amended Articles (as defined below)
impose certain restrictions on the transferability and ownership of PG&E Corporation common stock and preferred stock (together, the “capital stock”) and
other interests designated as “stock” of PG&E Corporation by the Board of Directors as disclosed in an SEC filing (such stock and other interests, the “Equity
Securities,” and such restrictions on transferability and ownership, the “Ownership Restrictions”) in order to reduce the possibility of an equity ownership shift
that could result in limitations on PG&E Corporation’s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes from prior taxable years or
periods for federal income tax purposes. Any acquisition of PG&E Corporation capital stock that results in a shareholder being in violation of these restrictions
may not be valid.
49
Subject to certain exceptions, the Ownership Restrictions restrict (i) any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) from directly or indirectly
acquiring or accumulating 4.75% or more of the outstanding Equity Securities and (ii) the ability of any person or entity (including certain groups of persons)
already owning, directly or indirectly, 4.75% or more of the Equity Securities to increase their proportionate interest in the Equity Securities. For more
information, see “Because PG&E Corporation and the Utility have elected to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust, the application of the Ownership
Restrictions, as defined in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that
could differ materially from the number of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act” below. Any
transferee receiving Equity Securities that would result in a violation of the Ownership Restrictions will not be recognized as a shareholder of PG&E
Corporation or entitled to any rights of shareholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to receive dividends or distributions, whether
liquidating or otherwise, in each case, with respect to the Equity Securities causing the violation.
The Ownership Restrictions remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal, amendment, or modification of Section 382 (and any comparable successor
provision) of the IRC, in a manner that renders the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the IRC no longer applicable to PG&E Corporation, (ii) the
beginning of a taxable year in which the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation determines that no tax benefits attributable to net operating losses or other
tax attributes are available, (iii) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section 382 of the IRC as of
such date in the event of an “ownership change” of PG&E Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the IRC and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et
seq.) would not be materially less than the net operating loss carryforwards or “net unrealized built-in loss” (within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC and
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) of PG&E Corporation, and (iv) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that it is in the best
interests of PG&E Corporation’s shareholders for the Ownership Restrictions to be removed or released. The Ownership Restrictions may also be waived by
the Board of Directors on a case by case basis.
Because PG&E Corporation and the Utility have elected to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust, the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as
defined in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differ
materially from the number of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act.
The Plan contemplated that the Fire Victim Trust would be treated as a “qualified settlement fund” for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, subject to
PG&E Corporation’s ability to elect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes instead. On July 8, 2021,
PG&E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo, and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant to which PG&E
Corporation and the Utility made a grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim Trust.
As a result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in
turn attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust are effectively excluded from the total
number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the
Ownership Restrictions. See “Tax Matters” in Item 7. MD&A for an example of these calculations. PG&E Corporation does not control the number of shares
held by the Fire Victim Trust and is not able to determine in advance the number of shares the Fire Victim Trust will hold. PG&E Corporation intends to
periodically make available to investors information about the number of shares of common stock held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo as of
a specified date for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions, including in its Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports filed with the SEC.
PG&E Corporation intends to enforce the Ownership Restrictions as described in the foregoing paragraph (calculated as excluding any shares owned by the
Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo from the number of outstanding equity securities). All current and prospective shareholders are advised to consider
the foregoing in determining their ownership and acquisition of PG&E Corporation common stock.
50
PG&E Corporation may not be able to use some or all of its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to
offset future income.
As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation had net operating loss carryforwards for PG&E Corporation’s consolidated group for U.S. federal and California
income tax purposes of approximately $26.6 billion and $25.2 billion, respectively, and PG&E Corporation incurred and may also continue to incur, in
connection with the Plan, significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The ability of PG&E Corporation to use some or all of these net
operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. Under Section 382 of the IRC (which also applies for
California state income tax purposes), if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” such net operating loss carryforwards and
other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders
(generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest
percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).
As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and its net operating loss carryforwards
and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC. However, whether PG&E Corporation underwent or will undergo an ownership change as a
result of the transactions in PG&E Corporation’s equity that occurred pursuant to the Plan depends on several factors outside PG&E Corporation’s control and
the application of certain laws that are uncertain in several respects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service would not
successfully assert that PG&E Corporation has undergone or will undergo an ownership change pursuant to the Plan. In addition, even if these transactions did
not cause an ownership change, they may increase the likelihood that PG&E Corporation may undergo an ownership change in the future. If the Internal
Revenue Service successfully asserts that PG&E Corporation did undergo, or PG&E Corporation otherwise does undergo, an ownership change, the limitation
on its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382 of the IRC could be material to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
In particular, limitations imposed on PG&E Corporation’s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could cause U.S. federal and
California income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards or
other tax attributes to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. In
addition, PG&E Corporation’s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards to fund a customer credit trust is critical to whether the impact of the fixed
recovery charges paid by customers pursuant to the SB 901 securitization transactions will be neutral, on average, to such customers. Further, PG&E
Corporation’s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards is critical to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to make certain operating
and capital expenditures. Failure to obtain alternative sources of capital could have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the
value of PG&E Corporation common stock.
PG&E Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on shares of its common stock is subject to restrictions.
Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, PG&E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-GAAP
Core Earnings following the Emergence Date. “Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items as described in the Plan.
Subject to the foregoing restrictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of PG&E Corporation’s Board of
Directors and will depend on, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions,
and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.
51
PG&E Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from the Utility to
meet its obligations.
PG&E Corporation conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s consolidated assets are
held by the Utility. Accordingly, PG&E Corporation’s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness are
largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Utility and the distribution or other payment of these earnings and cash flows to PG&E Corporation
in the form of dividends or loans or advances and repayment of loans and advances from the Utility. The ability of the Utility to pay dividends or make other
advances, distributions, and transfers of funds will depend on its results of operations and may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws limiting the
amount of funds available for payment of dividends and certain restrictive covenants contained in the agreements of those subsidiaries. Additionally, the Utility
must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay
preferred stock dividends, and to meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation. In addition, the CPUC has
imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including financial conditions that require the Board of
Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility’s obligation to serve or to
operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. PG&E Corporation is unable to predict when it will commence the payment of dividends on its common
stock. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, the Utility for any reason could limit or impair the Utility’s ability to pay dividends or
other distributions to PG&E Corporation, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect PG&E Corporation’s ability to meet its obligations.
California law and certain provisions in the Amended Articles and the amended and restated bylaws of PG&E Corporation (the “Amended Bylaws”) may
prevent efforts by shareholders to change the direction or management of PG&E Corporation.
The Amended Articles and the Amended Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of PG&E Corporation more difficult without the approval of
the Board of Directors, including the following:
•until 2024, the Board of Directors will be divided into two equal classes, with members of each class elected in different years for different terms;
•only holders of shares who are entitled to cast ten percent or more of the votes can request a special meeting of the shareholders, and any such request
must satisfy the requirements specified in the Amended Bylaws; action by shareholders may otherwise only be taken at an annual or special meeting
duly called by or at the direction of a majority of the Board of Directors, or action by written consent signed by shareholders owning at least the
number of votes necessary to authorize the action at a meeting where all shares entitled to vote were present;
•advance notice for all shareholder proposals is required; and
•any person acquiring PG&E Corporation Equity Securities will be restricted from owning 4.75% or more of such Equity Securities (as determined for
federal income tax purposes (see “Tax Matters” in Item 7. MD&A)), subject to certain exceptions as may be determined by the Board of Directors of
PG&E Corporation.
These and other provisions in the Amended Articles, the Amended Bylaws, and California law could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential
acquirers to obtain control of the Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding
merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving PG&E Corporation. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of PG&E Corporation
common stock and limit opportunities for shareholders to realize value in a corporate transaction.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly
affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been (beginning in March 2020) and could
continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (and its variants), but the extent of such impact is uncertain.
52
PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to evaluate the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on their business and financial results. The consequences
of a continued and prolonged outbreak and resulting governmental and regulatory orders have had and could continue to have a negative impact on the Utility’s
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions, and resulting decrease in economic and industrial activity in the Utility’s
service area, have and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility’s customers. These circumstances have impacted and will continue to
impact the Utility for a period of time that PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict. For example, the economic downturn has resulted in a
reduction in customer receipts and collection delays throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Utility’s accounts receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $1.1 billion, or $890 million higher as
compared to the balances as of December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19
pandemic. The Utility expects to continue experiencing an impact on monthly cash collections for as long as current COVID-19 circumstances persist.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to quantify the long-term potential impact of the changes in customer collections or changes in energy demand on
earnings and cash flows due, in part, to uncertainties regarding the timing, duration and intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting economic
downturn. Although the CPUC authorized the establishment of memorandum and balancing accounts to track costs associated with customer protection
measures, the timing of regulatory relief, if any, and ultimate cost recovery from such accounts or otherwise, are uncertain.
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn have resulted and may continue to result in workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability
(including a reduction in contract labor resources) and deployment. Increased governmental regulation of the COVID-19 pandemic protections, including
vaccination mandates or testing requirements for workers, could result in employee attrition, workforce disruptions and increased supplier and contractor costs.
Although the Utility continues to prioritize customer and community safety, these disruptions necessitate changes to the Utility’s operating and capital
expenditure plans, which could lead to project delays or service disruptions in certain programs. Delays in production and shipping of materials used in the
Utility’s operations may also impact operations.
The Utility has experienced shortages in certain materials, longer lead times and delivery delays as a result of domestic and international raw material and labor
shortages. If these disruptions to the supply chain persist or worsen, the Utility may be delayed or prevented from completing planned maintenance and capital
projects work.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect additional financial impacts in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential longer-term impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic on PG&E Corporation or the Utility include the potential for higher credit spreads, borrowing costs and incremental financing needs.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s analysis of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and subject to change. PG&E Corporation and
the Utility are unable to predict the timing, duration or intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic situation and any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic and any
variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and intensity of measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic (including availability and effectiveness
of vaccines), and the effects of the COVID-19 situation on the business, financial condition and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and
on the business and general economic conditions in the State of California and the United States of America.
Rising rates for the Utility’s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE.
The rates paid by the Utility’s customers are impacted by the Utility’s costs, commodity prices, and broader energy trends. The Utility’s capital investment
plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, leveling demand, and the cumulative impact of
other public policy requirements, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. In particular, the Utility will need to make substantial,
sustained investments to its infrastructure to adapt to climate change. For more information on factors that could cause the Utility’s costs to increase, see “The
Utility’s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility’s actual costs could exceed its authorized or forecasted
costs due to various factors, including if the Utility is not able to manage its costs effectively” above. If customer rates increase, the CPUC may face greater
pressure to approve lesser amounts in the Utility’s ratemaking or cost recovery proceedings.
53
The Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as “pass-through” costs. Increases in the Utility’s commodity costs
directly impact customer bills.
Increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and customer enrollment in NEM, which allows self-generating
customers to receive bill credits for power exported to the grid at the full retail rate, shifts costs to other customers. Under this structure, NEM customers do not
pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, including costs associated with funding
social equity programs, subject to certain exceptions, while still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their
electricity needs. These unpaid costs are subsidized by customers not participating in NEM. Accordingly, as more electric customers switch to NEM and self-
generate energy, the burden on the remaining customers increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation, further increasing rate pressure on existing
non-NEM customers.
Other long-term trends could also increase costs for gas customers. Natural gas suppliers are subject to compliance with CARB’s cap-and-trade program, and
natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the program through 2030 (when the full cost will be reflected in customer
bills). CARB may also require aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use. Increased renewable portfolio standards in the electric
sector could reduce electric generation gas load. Additionally, customers replacing natural gas appliances with electric appliances will lead to further reduced
gas demand. The combination of reduced load and increased costs to maintain the gas system could result in higher natural gas customer bills. In addition,
some local city governments have passed ordinances restricting use of natural gas in new construction and, if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect
future demand for the provision of natural gas. If fewer customers receive gas from the Utility, the Utility’s gas system maintenance costs, many of which
cannot be reduced in the short term even if gas quantities decrease, would be borne by fewer customers. Finally, a mandate to purchase renewable natural gas
for core customers could lead to increased costs for core customers if utilities are competing with the transportation sector for supplies of renewable natural
gas.
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage
a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further reduce energy demand. Reduced energy demand or significantly
slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of
distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could increase the energy rates for other customers.
If rates were to rise too rapidly, customer usage could decline. This decline would decrease the volume of sales, among which the Utility’s costs are allocated,
and increase rates.
To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC may authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or increase the period over which the Utility is
allowed to recover amounts, which could impact the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs. The Utility’s level of authorized capital investment
could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. As a result, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.
Inflation may negatively impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have observed that prices for equipment, materials, supplies, employee labor, contractor services, and variable-rate debt
have increased. Long-term inflationary pressures may result in such prices continuing to increase more quickly than expected. Increases in inflation raises costs
for labor, materials and services, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to secure these resources on economically acceptable terms or offset
such costs with increased revenues, operating efficiencies, or cost savings, which may adversely impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
conditions, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Utility owns or has obtained the right to occupy or use real property comprising the Utility’s electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, electric
generation facilities, natural gas gathering facilities and generation facilities, and natural gas and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item
1. Business, under “Electric Utility Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations.” The Utility occupies or uses real property primarily through various
leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities. In total, the Utility occupies 9 million square feet of
real property, including 7 million square feet owned by the Utility. On September 17, 2021, the sale of the SFGO closed and the Utility entered into a leaseback
agreement with the new SFGO owner (the “Leaseback Agreement”) to lease back certain space within the SFGO to allow for additional time to relocate critical
facilities to other Utility sites. The Leaseback Agreement commenced on September 17, 2021 and continues through various dates for the various leased spaces,
with December 31, 2023 being the latest lease expiration date. On October 23, 2020, the Utility entered into an office lease agreement with BA2 300 Lakeside
LLC for approximately 910,000 rentable square feet of space within the Lakeside Building to serve as the Utility’s principal administrative headquarters. The
term of the lease began on April 8, 2022 and the lease grants the Utility an option to purchase the legal parcel that contains the Lakeside Building. For more
information, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
PG&E Corporation also leased approximately 42,000 square feet of office space from a third party in San Francisco, California. This lease expired, and the
leased premises were surrendered at the end of February 2022.
The Utility owns approximately 148,000 acres of land, including approximately 121,000 acres of watershed lands. In 2002, the Utility agreed to implement its
Land Conservation Commitment (“LCC”) to permanently preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through conservation
easements or equivalent protections, as well as to make approximately 40,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified organizations.
The six “beneficial public values” being preserved by the LCC include: natural habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation by the
general public; sustainable forestry; agricultural uses; and historic values. The Utility’s goal is to implement all the LCC transactions by the end of 2023,
subject to securing all required regulatory approvals.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.  For more information
regarding material lawsuits and proceedings, see “Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Notes 2, 15, and 16 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES
As of February 16, 2023, there were 43,782 holders of record of PG&E Corporation common stock. A substantially greater number of holders of PG&E
Corporation common stock are “street name” or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers, and other financial institutions. PG&E
Corporation common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is traded under the symbol “PCG.” Shares of common stock of the Utility are wholly
owned by PG&E Corporation and do not trade in the public market.
For information regarding dividends, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources - Dividends” in Item 7. MD&A and PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated
Statements of Equity, the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity, and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8.
Share Exchanges
On July 8, 2021, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant to
which PG&E Corporation and the Utility made a “grantor trust” election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim
Trust. As a result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and,
in turn attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. On the dates and in the amounts set forth in the table below, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged a
total of 290,000,000 Plan Shares, for an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement; in each
case, the Fire Victim Trust thereafter reported that it sold the applicable New Shares.

Not applicable.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
This is a combined report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities. This
combined MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8.
59
Key Factors Affecting Financial Results
PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the
following factors:
•The Uncertainties in Connection with Wildfires, Wildfire Mitigation, and Associated Cost Recovery. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the costs and effectiveness of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation
initiatives; the extent of damages from wildfires that do occur; the financial impacts of wildfires; and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to
mitigate those financial impacts with insurance, the Wildfire Fund, and regulatory recovery.
In response to the wildfire threat facing California, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic
wildfires. The Utility’s wildfire mitigation initiatives include EPSS, PSPS, vegetation management, asset inspections, and system hardening. In
particular, in 2022 the Utility expanded the EPSS program to all high fire risk areas. The Utility is also focused on undergrounding more lines each
year while using economies of scale to make undergrounding more cost efficient. These initiatives significantly reduced the number of CPUC-
reportable ignitions and the number of acres burned. The success of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation efforts depends on many factors, including
whether the Utility is able to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenditures in connection with these initiatives. For more
information on incurred expenditures, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The extent to which the Utility will
be able to recover these expenditures and other potential costs through rates is uncertain. If additional requirements are imposed that go beyond
current expectations, such requirements could have a substantial impact on the costs of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation initiatives.
The Utility is subject to a number of legal and regulatory requirements related to its wildfire mitigation efforts, which require periodic inspections of
electric assets and ongoing reporting related to this work. Although the Utility believes that it has complied substantially with these requirements, it is
undertaking a review and has identified instances of noncompliance. The Utility intends to update the CPUC and OEIS as its review progresses. The
Utility could face fines, penalties, enforcement action, or other adverse legal or regulatory consequences for the late inspections or other
noncompliance related to wildfire mitigation efforts. See “Self-Reports to the CPUC” in “Regulatory Matters” below.
Despite these extensive measures, the potential that the Utility’s equipment will be involved in the ignition of future wildfires, including catastrophic
wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (in particular extended periods of
seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. Once an ignition has
occurred, the Utility is unable to control the extent of damages, which is primarily determined by environmental conditions (including weather and
vegetation conditions), third-party suppression efforts, and the location of the wildfire.
The financial impact of past wildfires is significant. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had recorded aggregate liabilities of
$1.025 billion, $400 million, $1.175 billion, and $100 million for claims in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie
fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, respectively, and in each case before available insurance, and, in the case of the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022
Mosquito fire, other probable cost recoveries. These liability amounts correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable probable
losses but do not include all categories of potential damages and losses.
On September 24, 2021, the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office charged the Utility with 31 counts in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire, of
which the court has dismissed 20 counts. If the Utility were to be convicted of any of the remaining charges, the Utility could be subject to material
fines, penalties, and restitution, as well as non-monetary remedies such as oversight requirements. Accordingly, depending on which charges the
Utility were to be convicted of, its total losses associated with the 2020 Zogg fire could materially exceed the $400 million of aggregate liability that
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be able to mitigate the financial impact of future wildfires in excess of insurance coverage through the
Wildfire Fund, or cost recovery through rates. Each of these mitigations involves uncertainties, and liabilities could exceed available recoveries. See
“Loss Recoveries” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
60
Recorded liabilities in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2021 Dixie fire have already exceeded potential amounts recoverable under
applicable insurance policies. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility has recorded insurance receivables of $430 million for the 2019 Kincade fire, $370
million for the 2020 Zogg fire, $530 million for the 2021 Dixie fire, and $45 million for the 2022 Mosquito fire. Additionally, the Utility does not
expect that any of its liability insurance would cover restitution payments, if such payments were ordered by the court presiding over the criminal
proceeding in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire.
If the eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires were to exceed $1.0 billion in any Wildfire Fund coverage year (“Coverage Year”), the
Utility may be eligible to make a claim against the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 for such excess amount. The Wildfire Fund is available to the Utility
to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires, provided that the Utility satisfies the conditions to the Utility’s ongoing participation in the
Wildfire Fund set forth in AB 1054 and that the Wildfire Fund has sufficient remaining funds. However, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&E Corporation
and the Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility’s ability to demonstrate to the CPUC that wildfire-related costs paid from the
Wildfire Fund were just and reasonable and therefore not subject to reimbursement, and whether the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund
ultimately outweigh its substantial costs. Finally, recoveries for the 2019 Kincade fire would be subject to a 40% limitation on the allowed amount of
claims arising before emergence from bankruptcy. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility has recorded a Wildfire Fund receivable of $175 million for
the 2021 Dixie fire. See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
The Utility will be permitted to recover its wildfire-related claims and legal fees through rates only if the CPUC or the FERC, as applicable,
determines that the Utility has met the prudency standard. The revised prudency standard under AB 1054 has not been interpreted or applied by the
CPUC, and it is possible that the CPUC could interpret the standard or apply it to the relevant facts differently from how the Utility has interpreted and
applied the standard, in which case the Utility may not be able to recover all or a portion of expenses that it has recorded as receivables. As of
December 31, 2022, the Utility has recorded receivables for regulatory recovery of $503 million for the 2021 Dixie fire and $60 million for the 2022
Mosquito fire. See “2021 Dixie Fire,” and “2022 Mosquito Fire” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more
information.
•The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking and Other Proceedings. Regulatory ratemaking proceedings are a key aspect of the Utility’s business. The
Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g.,
maintenance, administrative and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation and financing expenses). In addition, the CPUC authorizes the
Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to pass through to customers (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did
not Impact Earnings” below), including its costs to procure electricity and natural gas for customers and to administer public purpose and customer
programs. Although the Utility generally seeks to recover its recorded costs on a timely basis, in recent years, the amount of the costs recorded in
memorandum and balancing accounts has increased. The Utility has also applied to transfer its non-nuclear generation assets to Pacific Generation and
potentially sell a minority interest in Pacific Generation. The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including
intervening parties’ testimonies, potential rate impacts, the regulatory and political environments, and other factors. See Notes 4 and 16 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters” below.
•The Outcome of Other Enforcement, Litigation, and Regulatory Matters, and Other Government Proposals. The Utility is subject to enforcement,
litigation, and regulatory matters, including those described above, the Safety Culture OII, EOEP proceedings, and actions in connection with the
Utility’s WMP, and safety and other self-reports. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. In addition, the Utility’s
business profile and financial results could be impacted by the outcome of recent calls for municipalization of part or all of the Utility’s businesses,
actions by municipalities and other public entities to acquire the electric assets of the Utility within their respective jurisdictions and calls for state
intervention, including the possibility of a state takeover of the Utility. See “Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility’s assets through eminent
domain” in Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. These matters could result in penalties, additional regulatory requirements, or changes to the
Utility’s operations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility seek to limit these matters by implementing a robust compliance program and by delivering
excellent customer experiences.
61
•PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Ability to Control Operating Costs. Under cost-of-service ratemaking, a utility’s earnings depend on its ability
to manage costs within the amounts authorized for recovery in its ratemaking proceedings. The Utility has set a goal to increase its capital investments
to meet safety and climate goals, while also reducing non-fuel Operating and maintenance costs by two percent per year. The Utility’s ability to meet
this goal depends on whether the Utility can improve the planning and execution of its work by continuing to implement the Lean operating system.
For more information about the risks that could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and
cash flows, or that could cause future results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.  In addition, this annual report contains forward-
looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions that are based
on current estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management’s knowledge of facts as of the
date of this report.  See “Forward-Looking Statements” above for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially.  PG&E
Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation to update forward-looking
statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.
Tax Matters
PG&E Corporation had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $26.6 billion and California net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $25.2 billion as of December 31, 2022.
Under Section 382 of the IRC, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwards and other tax
attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five
percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership
during the testing period (generally three years). PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles)
that increase a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons) ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to 4.75% or more prior to the
Restriction Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without approval by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation (the “Ownership
Restrictions”). As discussed below under “Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles,” due to the election to treat the Fire
Victim Trust as a grantor trust for income tax purposes, the calculation of Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) will effectively be
based on a reduced number of shares outstanding, namely the total number of outstanding equity securities less the number of equity securities held by the Fire
Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo. As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change,
and consequently, its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC.
Furthermore, the activities of the Fire Victim Trust are treated as activities of the Utility for tax purposes. Accordingly, PG&E Corporation will recognize
income tax benefits and the corresponding DTA as the Fire Victim Trust sells shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, and the amounts of such benefits
and assets will be impacted by the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the shares, rather than the price at the time such shares were transferred to the Fire
Victim Trust. At various dates throughout 2022, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged Plan Shares for an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated
by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement; in each case, the Fire Victim Trust thereafter reported that it sold the applicable New Shares. During the
year ended December 31, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock in the aggregate amount of 230,000,000 shares resulted in an
aggregate tax benefit of $870 million recorded in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
62
Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles
As a result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in
turn, attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust,
along with any shares owned by the Utility directly, are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s
Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the 4.75% ownership limitation in the Amended Articles. Shares owned by
ShareCo are also effectively excluded because ShareCo is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes. For example, although PG&E Corporation had
2,466,208,388 shares outstanding as of February 16, 2023, only 1,800,721,208 shares (the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of
shares held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles. As such,
based on the total number of outstanding equity securities and taking into account the shares of PG&E Corporation common stock known to have been sold by
the Fire Victim Trust as of February 16, 2023, a person’s effective Percentage Stock Ownership limitation for purposes of the Amended Articles as of
February 16, 2023 was 3.46% of outstanding shares. As of February 16, 2023, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fire Victim Trust had sold
290,000,000 shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in the aggregate.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion presents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating results for 2022 and 2021.  See “Key Factors Affecting Financial Results”
above for further discussion about factors that could affect future results of operations.
See “Results of Operations” in Item 7 of the 2021 Form 10-K for discussion of results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020.
PG&E Corporation
The consolidated results of operations consist primarily of results related to the Utility, which are discussed in the “Utility” section below.  The following table
provides a summary of net income (loss) available for common shareholders:
(in millions) 2022 2021
Consolidated Total $ 1,800 $ (102)
PG&E Corporation (412) (226)
Utility 2,212 124 
PG&E Corporation’s net loss primarily consists of income taxes and interest expense on long-term debt. The increase in PG&E Corporation’s net loss for 2022,
as compared to 2021, is primarily due to increased interest rates on long-term debt.
Utility
The table below shows certain items from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2022 and 2021.  The table separately identifies the revenues and
costs that impacted earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (such
as costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to
recover those pass-through costs do not impact earnings.
63
Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its
assets and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the
Utility incurs to own and operate its assets.

Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings
The following discussion presents the Utility’s operating results for 2022 and 2021, focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for these
periods.
Operating Revenues
The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased by $1.0 billion, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to
the recognition of approximately $310 million in revenues related to the settlement agreement for the 2018 CEMA application (see “2018 CEMA Application”
below), the recognition of approximately $180 million in revenues related to the final decision approving $356.3 million in revenue requirements for capital
expenditures incurred in the period from 2011 through 2014 for its GT&S system (see “2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” below), increased base
revenues authorized in the 2020 GRC, and additional revenues as authorized through the FERC formula rate. In addition, the Utility recognized approximately
$113 million in nuclear decommissioning revenues in 2022 with no comparable revenues in 2021. This is consistent with the 2018 NDCTP final decision that
authorized no decommissioning revenues for 2021 and $113 million in revenues in 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately
$180 million of previously deferred revenues recognized in conjunction with interim rate relief collected in 2021 associated with the 2020 WMCE application
(see “2020 WMCE Application” below).(1)
(1)
(1)
64
Operating and Maintenance
The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased by $83 million, or 1%, in 2022 compared to 2021, as a result of operating
cost efficiencies and decreases in the recognition of previously deferred costs including $90 million related to residential uncollectibles and approximately
$180 million recognized in conjunction with interim rate relief associated with the 2020 WMCE application (see “2020 WMCE Application” below). In
addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Utility recorded a $124 million charge related to the September 21, 2021 joint motion for approval of
settlement agreement associated with the 2020 WMCE filing, with no comparable charge in the same period in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by
the recognition of approximately $310 million of previously deferred expenses, which were authorized by the settlement agreement for the 2018 CEMA
application (see “2018 CEMA Application” below) in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.
SB 901 Securitization Charges, Net
SB 901 securitization charges, net, that impacted earnings increased by $608 million, or 100%, in 2022 compared to 2021. During the year ended December
31, 2022, the Utility recorded $608 million in net SB 901 securitization charges, for inception of the regulatory asset and liability pursuant to the CHT decision,
as well as tax benefits realized within income tax expense in the current year related to the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock, with
no comparable charges in 2021. For more information, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.
Wildfire-Related Claims, Net of Recoveries
Costs related to wildfires that impacted earnings decreased by $21 million, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of
$225 million related to the 2019 Kincade fire, $100 million related to the 2022 Mosquito fire, $25 million related to the 2021 Dixie fire, and $25 million related
to the 2020 Zogg fire in the year ended December 31, 2022. These charges were partially offset by $95 million of probable recoveries through insurance and
the WEMA related to the 2022 Mosquito fire and $25 million in probable recoveries through the Wildfire Fund related to the 2021 Dixie fire. The Utility
recognized pre-tax charges of $1.15 billion related to the 2021 Dixie fire, $175 million related to the 2019 Kincade fire, and $100 million related to the 2020
Zogg fire in the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by $1.06 billion of probable recoveries through insurance, the WEMA, and the Wildfire Fund
related to the 2021 Dixie fire and $100 million of probable insurance recoveries related to the 2020 Zogg fire in the year ended December 31, 2021. See “Loss
Recoveries” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.
In addition to the probable wildfire-related recoveries noted above, the Utility has recorded $125 million of probable recoveries through FERC TO formula
rates, which are recorded as a reduction to regulatory liabilities and are not captured in wildfire-related claims.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Wildfire Fund Expense
Wildfire Fund expense that impacted earnings decreased by $40 million, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to accelerated amortization of the
Wildfire Fund asset recorded in 2021 as a result of the Wildfire Fund receivable accrued in relation to the 2021 Dixie fire, with no material amounts recorded in
2022.
See Notes 3 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning
The Utility’s depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $453 million, or 13%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an
increase in net capital additions and an increase in decommissioning expense beginning in January 2022 primarily as a result of the final 2018 NDCTP
decision.
Interest Income
The Utility’s interest income that impacted earnings increased by $140 million, or 636%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher interest rates
earned on regulatory balancing accounts.
65
Interest Expense
Interest expense that impacted earnings increased by $285 million, or 21%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term
debt and an increase in interest rates on variable-rate debt.
Other Income, Net
Changes to Other income, net that impact earnings are primarily driven by fluctuations in the balance of construction work in progress that impact the equity
component of AFUDC, and gains and losses on equity securities held by the customer credit trust.
Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
Income tax benefit increased by $2.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a write-off of a DTA associated with the grantor trust election for the
Fire Victim Trust in the year ended December 31, 2021 and a benefit recognized related to the sale of shares in the Fire Victim Trust in the year ended
December 31, 2022.
The following table reconciles the income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the income tax provision:
2022 2021
Federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %
Increase (decrease) in income tax rate resulting from:
State income tax (net of federal benefit) (26.9)% 24.1 %
Effect of regulatory treatment of fixed asset differences (49.2)% (51.6)%
Tax credits (1.3)% (1.2)%
Fire Victim Trust (64.0)% 91.9 %
Other, net 2.2 % 2.6 %
Effective tax rate (118.2)% 86.8 %
Includes the effect of state flow-through ratemaking treatment and the effect of the grantor trust election.
Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs. For these temporary tax differences, the Utility recognizes the deferred tax impact in the current
period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities. Therefore, the Utility’s effective tax rate is impacted as these differences arise and reverse. The Utility recognizes such differences as
regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates. The amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess
deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax Act.
 Includes the tax benefit of the sale of shares by the Fire Victim Trust in 2022 and the tax effect of the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust in 2021. See “Tax Matters” above and Note 7 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings
Fluctuations in revenues that did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs. See below for more information. (1)

66
Cost of Electricity
The Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), fuel and associated
transmission costs used in its own generation facilities, fuel and associated transmission costs supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements,
costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities. Cost of electricity also includes net
sales (Utility owned generation and third parties) in the CAISO electricity markets. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8. The Utility’s total purchased power is driven by customer demand, net CAISO electricity market activities (purchases or sales), the availability of the
Utility’s own generation facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source of electricity. The cost of
electricity decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021. This was primarily due to decreased customer demand and higher energy sales to the CAISO, partially
offset by higher fuel prices.
(in millions) 2022 2021
Cost of purchased power, net $ 2,283 $ 2,883 
Fuel used in own generation facilities 473 349 
Total cost of electricity $ 2,756 $ 3,232 
Cost of Natural Gas
The Utility’s cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade
program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The
cost of natural gas increased in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to increased customer demand and higher market prices. This was driven primarily by below-
normal winter temperatures and prolonged drought conditions, resulting in lower California and Pacific Northwest hydro-electric generation output and higher
demand from natural-gas fired generation. Lower natural gas storage levels and regional pipeline constraints also contributed to higher natural gas prices.
(in millions) 2022 2021
Cost of natural gas sold $ 1,957 $ 1,010 
Transportation cost of natural gas sold 143 139 
Total cost of natural gas $ 2,100 $ 1,149 
Operating and Maintenance Expenses
The Utility’s operating expenses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred.  If the Utility were to
spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact on earnings.
Other Income, Net
The Utility’s other income, net that did not impact earnings includes pension and other post-retirement benefit costs that fluctuate primarily from market and
interest rate changes.
Nuclear Operations
Capacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, reflect the availability of Diablo Canyon’s
generation to the California electricity market. Management analyzes capacity factors by comparing Diablo Canyon’s actual generation to forecasted annual
capacity factors, which reflect planned refueling outages, curtailments for condenser cleaning, allowances for minor curtailments resulting from equipment
issues, and curtailments for major ocean storms.
Apart from cost-of-service ratemaking and beginning on September 2, 2022, the Utility is entitled to receive a monthly performance-based disbursement. For
more information, see “Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations” below.
67
The Utility manages its scheduled refueling outages with the objective of minimizing their duration and maintaining high nuclear generating capacity factors,
resulting in a stable generation base for the Utility’s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. During scheduled refueling outages, the Utility performs
maintenance and equipment upgrades to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe, reliable operations. For the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, Diablo Canyon achieved an average capacity factor of 90% and 84%, respectively. As previously disclosed, Diablo Canyon Unit
2 experienced five outages between July 2020 and April 2021, each due or related to excessive vibrations within the main generator.
In addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by the Utility during scheduled refueling outages, the Utility has extensive operating and
security procedures in place to assure the safe operation of Diablo Canyon. The Utility also has extensive safety systems in place designed to protect the plant,
personnel, and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident.
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Overview
PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund their present and future commitments.
The Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and make distributions to PG&E
Corporation depends on the levels of its operating cash flows and access to the capital and credit markets. The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capital structure,
the aggregate amount of long-term and short-term debt that the Utility may issue, and the revenue requirements the Utility is able to collect to recover its cost
of capital. The Utility generally utilizes retained earnings, equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-term debt issuances to maintain its CPUC-
authorized long-term capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock and relies on short-term debt, including its revolving credit
facilities, to fund temporary financing needs. On May 28, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among other
things, grants the Utility a temporary, five-year waiver from compliance with its authorized capital structure for the financing in place upon the Utility’s
emergence from Chapter 11.
PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and fund equity contributions to the Utility depends on the
level of cash on hand, cash received from the Utility, and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters. Credit rating
downgrades may impact the cost and availability of short-term borrowings, including credit facilities, and long-term debt costs. In addition, some of the
Utility’s commodity contracts contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral
posting provisions for some of the Utility’s power and natural gas commodity, and transportation and service agreements state that if the Utility’s credit ratings
were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some or all of its net liability
positions.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have various contractual commitments which impact cash requirements. These commitments are discussed in “Purchase
Commitments” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
68
Arrearages Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly
affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of variant strains of the virus (including Delta
and Omicron), and the resulting economic conditions and government orders have had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility’s
customers and, as a result, these circumstances have impacted and will continue to impact the Utility for an indeterminate period of time. In particular, the
Utility continues to experience increased arrearages. The principal areas of near-term impact include liquidity, financial results and business operations,
stemming primarily from the ongoing economic hardship of the Utility’s customers, an annual cap set by the CPUC on the number of service disconnections
for residential customers, and the CPUC’s “Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer COVID-19
Protections.” The Utility resumed non-residential and residential service disconnections as of October 13, 2022. The Utility’s accounts receivable balances over
30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2022, were approximately $1.1 billion, or $890 million higher as compared to the balance as of December 31, 2019.
The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had access to approximately $2.9 billion of total liquidity comprised of approximately
$609 million of Utility cash, $125 million of PG&E Corporation cash and $2.2 billion of availability under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s revolving
credit facilities. The 2022 cost of capital application was filed off-cycle based on the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government
response. See “Cost of Capital Proceedings” below for more information.
The Utility established the CPPMA for tracking costs related to the CPUC’s emergency authorization and order for the period the CPPMA was in effect. As of
December 31, 2022, the CPPMA totaled $26 million and is reflected in Long-term regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition to the $26
million recorded to the CPPMA, the Utility recorded approximately $126 million of under-collections from residential customers from March 4, 2020 to
December 31, 2022 to the RUBA, which has been approved by the CPUC and is reflected in Regulatory balancing accounts receivable on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 205, which included authorization for additional incremental CAPP funding of $958 million for
California IOUs. The Utility received approximately $200 million in November 2022 to reduce the amounts owed by customer accounts in arrears. The amount
of funding was determined by the California Department of Community Services and Development, which is the agency responsible for administering the
CAPP.
Because electric rates have been set using a sales forecast that has been adjusted for impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do
not expect significant variances between the forecast of electric usage and actual electric usage due to COVID-19 in 2023. Consequently, PG&E Corporation
and the Utility do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to result in undercollections.
The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact PG&E Corporation and the Utility financially, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to
monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG&E Corporation and
the Utility maintain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Utility holds
restricted cash that primarily consists of AB 1054 and SB 901 fixed recovery charge collections that are to be used to service the associated bonds.

Financial Resources
Equity Financings
On April 30, 2021, PG&E Corporation entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with the Agents, the Forward Sellers and the Forward Purchasers (each
as defined in “At the Market Equity Distribution Program” in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), establishing an at the
market equity distribution program, pursuant to which PG&E Corporation, through the Agents, may offer and sell from time to time shares of PG&E
Corporation’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $400 million. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that, in addition to the
issuance and sale of shares of common stock by PG&E Corporation to or through the Agents, PG&E Corporation may enter into Forward Sale Agreements (as
defined in “At the Market Equity Distribution Program” in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8) with the Forward
Purchasers. On October 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation suspended the At the Market Equity Distribution Program until further notice. As of the suspension date
for this program, PG&E Corporation had not sold any shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility plan to meet their capital requirements for 2023 through internally generated funds and the issuance of long-term debt,
short-term debt, and the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation. (See “Application with Pacific Generation LLC for Approval to Transfer
Non-Nuclear Generation Assets” below.) PG&E Corporation does not plan to issue any equity securities in 2023 or 2024. Factors that could affect PG&E
Corporation’s planned equity issuances include liquidity and cash flow needs, capital expenditures, interest rates, the timing and outcome of ratemaking
proceedings, and the timing and terms of other financings, including the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation.

For more information, see “AB 1054” in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Credit Facilities
As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had $500 million and $1.5 billion available under their respective $500 million and $4.4 billion
revolving credit facilities. The Utility also has access to the Receivables Securitization Program, under which the Utility may borrow the lesser of the facility
limit and the facility availability. The facility limit fluctuates between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion depending on the periods set forth in the amendment.
Further, the facility availability may vary based on the amount of accounts receivable that the Utility owns that are eligible for sale to the SPV and the portion
of those accounts receivable that are sold to the SPV that are eligible for advances by the lenders under the Receivables Securitization Program from time to
time.
Utility
On March 31, 2022, the Utility prepaid in full the remaining portion of the 18-month tranche loans pursuant to the 2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement,
in a principal amount equal to $298 million. As a result of such prepayment, the 2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated and is no longer
outstanding.
On April 4, 2022, the Utility entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “2022A Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”), comprised of 364-day tranche loans
in the aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans”). On July 21, 2022, the 364-Day 2022A Tranche Loans were prepaid
in full with a portion of the proceeds from issuance of the Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds. As a result of such prepayment, the 2022A Utility Term Loan Credit
Agreement was terminated and is no longer outstanding.
71
On April 20, 2022, the Utility entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “2022B Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement”), comprised of 364-day tranche
loans in the aggregate principal amount of $125 million (the “364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans”) and two-year tranche loans in the aggregate principal amount of
$400 million (the “2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans”). The 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans have a maturity date of April 19, 2023 and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche
Loans have a maturity date of April 19, 2024. The 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans bear interest based on the Utility’s
election of either (1) the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (plus a 0.10% credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin of 1.25%, or (2) the base
rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25%. The Utility borrowed the entire amount of the 364-Day 2022B Tranche Loans and the 2-Year 2022B Tranche Loans on
April 20, 2022.
On April 20, 2022, the Utility entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Program to, among other things, add an uncommitted incremental
facility which, subject to certain conditions precedent, allows the SPV to request an increase in the facility limit by an additional $500 million to an aggregate
amount of $1.5 billion. On August 12, 2022, the SPV made such a request to increase the facility limit, and the facility limit was subsequently increased to
$1.5 billion on August 22, 2022. On September 30, 2022, the Utility entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Program to, among other
things, (i) extend the scheduled termination date to September 30, 2024 and (ii) implement a seasonal facility limit. After giving effect to the amendment, the
facility limit fluctuates between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion based on the periods set forth in the amendment.
On July 1, 2020, the Utility entered into the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement, which it subsequently amended. On October 4, 2022, the Utility further
amended the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders to $4.4 billion and (ii)
extend the maturity date of such agreement to June 22, 2027 (subject to a one-year extension at the option of the Utility).
PG&E Corporation
On July 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation entered into the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, which it subsequently amended. On October 4, 2022, PG&E
Corporation further amended the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date of such agreement to June 22, 2025
(subject to a one-year extension at the option of PG&E Corporation).
For more information, see “Credit Facilities” in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Intercompany Note Payable
On August 11, 2021, PG&E Corporation borrowed $145 million from the Utility under an interest bearing 364-day intercompany note due August 10, 2022. On
June 17, 2022, this loan was repaid in full.
Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31,
2018.
On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock as of
January 31, 2022 totaling $59.1 million, which was paid on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022. In addition to the dividends paid in arrears,
the Utility paid approximately $11 million of dividends on redeemable preferred stock during the year ended December 31, 2022. On December 15, 2022, the
Board of Directors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock totaling $3.5 million, which was paid on February 15, 2023, to
holders of record on January 31, 2023.
On June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility also reinstated the dividend on the Utility’s common stock and declared a common stock dividend of
$425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on June 17, 2022. On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock
dividend of $425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on September 16, 2022. On December 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a
common stock dividend of $425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on December 20, 2022. No dividend is payable until declared by the Board of
Directors of the Utility.
72
Subject to the dividend restrictions described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, any decision to declare and pay
dividends on PG&E Corporation’s common stock in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things,
results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions of PG&E Corporation, and other factors that the Board of Directors of
PG&E Corporation may deem relevant. Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, PG&E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it
recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-GAAP Core Earnings following the Emergence Date. “Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain
non-core items as described in the Plan. PG&E Corporation is unable to predict when it will commence the payment of dividends on its common stock.
Utility Cash Flows
PG&E Corporation’s consolidated cash flows consist primarily of cash flows related to the Utility. The following discussion presents the Utility’s cash flows
for 2022 and 2021. 
See “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in Item 7 of the 2021 Form 10-K for discussion of the Utility’s cash flows for 2021 compared to 2020.
The Utility’s cash flows were as follows:
Year Ended December 31,
 (in millions) 2022 2021
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,831 $ 2,448 
Net cash used in investing activities (10,069) (7,050)
Net cash provided by financing activities 6,879 4,379 
Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 641 $ (223)
Operating Activities
The Utility’s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as
depreciation that do not require the use of cash.  During 2022, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.4 billion compared to the same period
in 2021.  This increase was partially due to an increase in base revenues authorized in the 2020 GRC and additional revenues as authorized through the FERC
formula rate and a decrease in operating and maintenance expense as a result of operating cost efficiencies. In addition, during 2022, the Utility made a
payment to the Fire Victim Trust of $592 million as compared to a payment of $758 million in the same period in 2021.
Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including:
•the timing and amount of costs in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire and the
timing and amount of any potential related insurance, Wildfire Fund, and regulatory recoveries;
•the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with current and future enforcement, litigation, and
regulatory matters (see “Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and
“Regulatory Matters” below for more information);
•the severity, extent and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Utility’s service area, the ability of the Utility to collect on
its customer receivables, the ability of the Utility’s customers to pay their utility bills in full and in a timely manner, the ability of the Utility to offset
these effects, including with spending reductions, and the ability of the Utility to recover through rates any losses incurred in connection with the
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the availability or cost of financing;
•the timing and amounts of available funds to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from future wildfires;
•the timing and amount of substantially increasing costs in connection with the 2020-2022 WMP and the costs previously incurred in connection with
the 2019 WMP that are not currently being recovered through rates (see “Regulatory Matters” below for more information);
73
•the timing and amounts of available funds collected for self-insurance (see “2023 General Rate Case” in the Regulatory Matters section of Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis for more information);
•the timing of the gain to be returned to customers from the sale of the SFGO and transmission tower wireless licenses and the amounts incurred
related to the move to and the leasing of the Lakeside Building; and
•the timing and outcomes of the Utility’s pending and future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, including the extent to which PG&E Corporation
and the Utility are able to recover their costs through regulated rates as recorded in memorandum accounts or balancing accounts, or as otherwise
requested.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material
effect on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital
resources, other than those discussed under “Purchase Commitments” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $3.0 billion during 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily driven by a
$1.9 billion increase in capital expenditures, including additional system hardening and emergency response work performed in 2022. Additionally, the Utility
purchased $1.0 billion of investments as part of the creation of the customer credit trust, with no similar purchases in 2021.
The Utility’s investing activities primarily consist of the construction of new and replacement facilities necessary to provide safe and reliable electricity and
natural gas services to its customers. Cash used in investing activities also includes the proceeds from sales of nuclear decommissioning trust and customer
credit trust investments which are partially offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioning trust and customer credit trust
investments. The funds in the decommissioning trusts, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling the
Utility’s nuclear generation facilities. Pursuant to SB 901, the funds in the customer credit trust, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively to fund
a monthly credit to customers that is anticipated to equal the fixed recovery charges such that the SB 901 securitization is designed to be rate neutral to
customers.
Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur
between $7.9 billion and $11.2 billion in 2023. Additionally, future cash flows used in investing activities will be impacted by the timing and amount related to
the intended purchase of the Lakeside Building, and the timing and amount of contributions to the customer credit trust, including shareholder tax benefits, and
$1.0 billion of cash to be contributed in 2024.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $2.5 billion during 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the
issuance of $7.5 billion of SB 901 recovery bonds and a decrease of $850 million in net repayments of short-term debt. These increases were partially offset by
a $5.9 billion increase in amounts paid to satisfy long-term debt outstanding in 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operating
activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date or prepayment date of
existing debt instruments.  Additionally, the Utility’s future cash flows from financing activities will be affected by the timing and outcome of future AB 1054
securitization transactions, the timing and outcome of the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation to one or more investors to be identified,
dividend payments, and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation.
LITIGATION MATTERS
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and
litigation matters described in Note 2, Note 15, and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 that are incorporated by reference
herein. The outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
74
REGULATORY MATTERS
The Utility is subject to substantial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The resolutions of the
proceedings described below and other proceedings may materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, and cash flows.
During the year ended December 31, 2022 and through the date of this filing, the Utility has continued to make progress on regulatory and legislative matters.
•In February 2023, the CPUC approved a final decision, adopting without modification the Utility’s settlement agreement in its 2020 WMCE
proceeding, pursuant to which the Utility will recover a revenue requirement of $1.04 billion. In January 2023, the Utility submitted a partial
settlement regarding the 2021 WMCE application pursuant to which the Utility would receive a revenue requirement of $720.7 million. In December
2022, the Utility filed the 2022 WMCE application requesting cost recovery of approximately $1.36 billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in a
proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.29 billion.
•In December 2022, OEIS issued the Utility’s 2022 safety certification.
•In December 2022, the CPUC approved a resolution authorizing the Utility’s exit from the EOEP.
•In December 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Utility’s 2023 cost of capital proceeding, which sets the Utility’s ROE for 2023 at 10%.
•In November 2022, OEIS issued its final decision approving the Utility’s 2022 WMP, which the CPUC ratified in December.
•In November 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Utility’s 2022 cost of capital proceeding. The decision retains the Utility’s cost of capital
previously authorized in the 2020 cost of capital proceeding.
•In September 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC regarding the separation of its non-nuclear generation assets into a stand-alone
Utility subsidiary and the potential sale of a minority interest in the newly-formed subsidiary to one or more investors to be identified.
•In September 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 884, which authorizes and expedites OEIS and CPUC review of a 10-year undergrounding
plan.
•In September 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon until 2030. In October
2022, the Utility executed a loan agreement with the DWR for up to $1.4 billion. In November, the DOE conditionally selected the Utility to receive
funding of up to $1.1 billion as part of the Civil Nuclear Credit Program.
•In August 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the securitization of up to approximately $1.4 billion of fire risk mitigation capital
expenditures, and in November 2022, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A
Senior Secured Recovery Bonds. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
•In March 2022, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement for the Utility’s 2018 CEMA application approving a total revenue requirement of
$683 million plus interest for its expenses and capital costs, which is approximately 90% of the Utility’s total cost recovery request.
•In February 2022, a CPUC decision finding $7.5 billion of stress test costs eligible for securitization pursuant to SB 901 and a financing order
authorizing the issuance of up to $7.5 billion of recovery bonds became final and non-appealable. PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued
$3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds in May and $3.9 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-B
Recovery Bonds in July. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
75
•In February 2022, the Utility served supplemental testimony for its 2023 GRC to reflect the Utility’s integrated wildfire mitigation strategy, including
the Utility’s proposals for the initial phase of undergrounding 10,000 miles of electric distribution powerlines. In September 2022, the Utility
submitted testimony updating the revenue requirement to reflect updates for escalation rates and federal tax law and guidance. As amended and
updated, the Utility’s application requests revenue requirements of $15.82 billion and a weighted-average GRC rate base of $50.41 billion for its 2023
test year. In January 2023, the Utility filed a motion for approval of a settlement agreement for all amounts at issue in the second track of the
proceeding, for $183 million in expense and $127 million of capital expenditures. Also in January 2023, the CPUC approved a settlement pursuant to
which the Utility’s wildfire liability insurance will be entirely based on self-insurance beginning in 2023.
Cost Recovery Proceedings
Periodically, costs arise that could not have been anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC proceedings or that have been deliberately excluded from such
requests. These costs may result from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek
authority to track incremental costs in a memorandum account and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are
deemed incremental and prudently incurred. The CPUC may also authorize balancing accounts with limitations or caps to cost recovery. These accounts, which
include the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with
work related to disaster and wildfire response, other wildfire prevention-related costs, certain third-party wildfire claims, and insurance costs. While the Utility
generally expects such costs to be recoverable, there can be no assurance that the CPUC will authorize the Utility to recover the full amount of its costs.
In recent years, the amount of the costs recorded in these accounts has increased. Because rate recovery may require CPUC authorization for these accounts,
there can be a delay between when the Utility incurs costs and when it may recover those costs. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility had recorded an
aggregate amount of approximately $6.2 billion in costs for the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, MGMA, and RTBA. Of
these costs, approximately $856 million was authorized for recovery and accounted for as current, and $5.3 billion was accounted for as long term as of
December 31, 2022. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
If the amount of the costs recorded in these accounts continues to increase or the delay between incurring and recovering costs lengthens, PG&E Corporation
and the Utility may incur additional financing costs. If the Utility does not recover the full amount of its recorded costs, the difference between the recorded
and recovered amounts would be written off as a non-cash disallowance. Such disallowances could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Except as otherwise noted, the Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following applications. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs included in these
applications.
For more information, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, “Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost Recovery
Applications,” and “Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Application” below.
The Utility’s cost recovery proceedings for the costs described above that are pending, have pending appeals, or were completed during the year ended
December 31, 2022 are summarized in the following table:
Proceeding Request Status
2020 WMCE Revenue requirement of approximately $1.28 billion Settlement agreement to recover $1.04 billion of revenue
requirement approved February 2023.
2021 WMCE Revenue requirement of approximately $1.47 billion Partial settlement agreement to recover $721 million of revenue
requirement filed January 2022. Settlement excludes VMBA’s
$591 million revenue requirement.
2022 WMCE Revenue requirement of approximately $1.36 billion Filed December 15, 2022.
2018 CEMA Revenue requirement of $763 million Settlement agreement to recover $683 million plus interest

Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost Recovery Applications
2020 WMCE Application
On September 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation and
certain catastrophic events (the “2020 WMCE application”). The recorded expenditures, which excluded amounts disallowed as a result of the CPUC’s
decision in the OII into the multiple wildfires that began on October 8, 2017 and spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte,
Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Nevada and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City (the “2017 Northern California wildfires”), and the 2018
Camp fire, consisted of $1.18 billion in expense and $801 million in capital expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately
$1.28 billion.
The costs addressed in the 2020 WMCE application cover activities mainly during the years 2017 to 2019 and were incremental to those previously authorized
in the Utility’s 2017 GRC and other proceedings. The majority of costs addressed in this application reflected work necessary to mitigate wildfire risk and to
respond to catastrophic events occurring during the years 2017 to 2019. The Utility’s requested revenue included amounts for the FHPMA of $293 million, the
FRMMA and the WMPMA of $740 million, and the CEMA of $251 million.
On September 21, 2021, the Utility and certain parties filed a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement that would resolve all of the
issues raised by the settling parties in the 2020 WMCE application. The settlement agreement proposes that the Utility recover a revenue requirement of
$1.04 billion. The settlement agreement authorizes the Utility to recover a revenue requirement of $591 million over a 24-month amortization period beginning
March 2023, which is in addition to the interim rate relief of $447 million that was approved by an earlier CPUC decision. On February 2, 2023, the CPUC
approved a final decision adopting the settlement agreement without modifications.
2021 WMCE Application
On September 16, 2021, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $1.6 billion of recorded expenditures,
resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.47 billion (the “2021 WMCE application”). The costs addressed in this application reflect
costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred
primarily in 2020.
The recorded expenditures consist of $1.4 billion in expenses and $197 million in capital expenditures. The costs addressed in the 2021 WMCE application are
incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility’s 2017 GRC, 2020 GRC, and other proceedings. The majority of the Utility’s proposed revenue
requirement would be collected over a two-year period beginning in January 2023.
The Utility’s requested revenue requirement includes amounts recorded to the VMBA of $592 million, the CEMA of $535 million, the WMBA of $149 million,
and other memorandum accounts. On November 18, 2021, the Utility filed updates to the application, increasing total costs by $19.4 million. On December 30,
2021, the Utility filed supplemental testimony reducing the cost recovery request of the COVID-19 CEMA costs by $12.2 million. The $12.2 million reduction
was a result of costs, such as employee business travel expenses and in-person training costs, that the Utility was able to avoid due to the pandemic.
On January 18, 2023, the Utility, TURN, and Cal Advocates filed a joint motion for approval of a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the Utility would
receive a revenue requirement of $720.7 million. The settlement agreement does not address $591.9 million recorded to the VMBA, for which cost recovery
will be determined separately by the CPUC.
2022 WMCE Application
On December 15, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $1.36 billion of recorded expenditures,
resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.29 billion (the “2022 WMCE application”). The costs addressed in this application reflect
costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred
primarily in 2021.
77
The recorded expenditures consist of $1.2 billion in expenses and $136 million in capital expenditures. The costs addressed in the 2022 WMCE application are
incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility’s 2020 GRC and other proceedings. In connection with the 2022 WMCE application, the Utility also
requested interim rate relief of $1.1 billion to be recovered over 12 months beginning June 1, 2023. The remaining $224 million would be recovered after the
CPUC issues a final decision.
The Utility has proposed a schedule that would call for a final decision by the CPUC in December 2023.
Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Application
The CPUC allows utilities to recover the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of
emergency by competent federal or state authorities. The Utility has historically sought such costs through standalone CEMA applications. More recently, the
Utility has sought to recover CEMA-eligible costs through its WMCE applications.
In addition to the Utility’s responsibilities in responding to catastrophic events, in 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention and
vegetation management work in response to the severe drought in California. Through 2019, the costs associated with this work were tracked in the CEMA. In
the 2020 GRC decision, the CPUC required the Utility to track these costs in the VMBA for the period beginning January 1, 2020.
2018 CEMA Application
On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven
catastrophic events that included fire and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in
2016 and 2017 to cut back or remove dead or dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The Utility filed three
revisions to this application, resulting in a total cost recovery request of $763 million.
On April 25, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s request for interim rate relief, allowing for recovery of $373 million of costs as requested by the Utility at
that time. The interim rate relief was implemented, commencing on October 1, 2019.
On March 17, 2022, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement authorizing the Utility to collect a total of $683 million plus interest for the 2018 CEMA
application. As noted above, $373 million of the total amount had already been collected in interim rates. The interim rates became final and are no longer
subject to refund. The remainder of the authorized revenue requirement will be amortized over a 12-month period, which began on June 1, 2022.
Forward-Looking Rate Cases
The Utility routinely participates in forward-looking rate case applications before the CPUC and the FERC. Those applications include GRCs, where the
revenue required for general operations (“base revenue”) of the Utility is assessed and reset. In addition, the Utility is periodically involved in “cost of capital”
proceedings to adjust its regulated return on rate base. The Utility’s future earnings will depend on the revenue requirements authorized in such rate cases.
Decisions in GRC proceedings have historically been expected prior to the commencement of the period to which the rates would apply. In recent years,
decisions in GRC proceedings have been delayed. Delayed decisions may cause the Utility to develop its budgets based on approved revenue requirements and
possible outcomes, rather than authorized amounts. When decisions are delayed, the CPUC typically provides rate relief to the Utility effective as of the
commencement of the rate case period (not effective as of the date of the delayed decision). Nonetheless, the Utility’s spending during the period of the delay
may exceed the authorized amount, without an ability for the Utility to seek cost recovery of such excess. If the Utility’s spending during the period of the
delay is less than the authorized amount, the Utility could be exposed to operational and financial risk associated with the lower level of work achieved
compared to that funded by the CPUC.
Except as otherwise noted, the Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following applications. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected depending on the outcomes of these applications.
78
The Utility’s forward-looking rate cases that are pending, have pending appeals, or were completed during the year ended December 31, 2022 are summarized
in the following table:
Rate Case Request Status
2023 GRC Revenue requirement of $15.82 billion for 2023 A decision is scheduled for the third quarter of 2023.
2022 Cost of Capital Leave cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for 2022Final decision issued November 2022, leaving the cost of capital
components at pre-2022 levels for 2022. Intervenors filed
application for rehearing in December 2022.
2023 Cost of Capital Increase ROE to 11% and cost of debt to 4.31% Final decision issued December 2022, adopting a 10% ROE.
Intervenor filed application for rehearing in January 2023.
2015 GT&S Revenue requirement of $416 million related to 2011-2014
capital expenditures subject to auditFinal decision issued July 2022 approving settlement to recover
$356 million of revenue requirements.
2023 General Rate Case
On June 30, 2021, the Utility filed its 2023 GRC application with the CPUC (“the Original Application”). The 2023 GRC combined what had historically been
separated into the GRC and GT&S rate cases. In a GRC, the CPUC approves annual revenue requirements for the first year (a “test year”) of the GRC period
and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period (known as “attrition
years”). In the 2023 GRC, the CPUC will determine the annual amount of base revenues that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2023
through 2026 to recover its anticipated costs for gas distribution, gas transmission and storage, electric distribution, and electric generation and to provide the
Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return. The Utility’s revenue requirements for other portions of its operations, such as electric transmission,
and electricity, natural gas and power purchases, are authorized in other regulatory proceedings overseen by the CPUC or the FERC. In the Original
Application, the Utility proposed a series of safety, resiliency, and clean energy investments to further reduce wildfire risk and deliver safe, reliable, and clean
energy service.
Between August 2021 and January 2022, the Utility served various updates to its 2023 GRC testimony. On February 25, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the
Utility served supplemental testimony for its 2023 GRC to reflect the Utility’s integrated wildfire mitigation strategy, including the Utility’s proposals for the
initial phase of undergrounding 10,000 miles of electric distribution powerlines in high fire risk areas throughout the Utility’s service area, the EPSS program,
and its EVM program. On March 10, 2022, the Utility filed an amended application that revised and superseded the revenue requirement request in the Original
Application. On September 6, 2022, the Utility submitted testimony updating the revenue requirement request in its 2023 GRC proceeding. The testimony
reflected updates for escalation rates and federal tax law and guidance since the filing of the Original Application. On December 9, 2022, the Utility submitted
a post-hearing reply brief. In the reply brief, the Utility updated the revenue requirement request due to the wildfire insurance settlement dated October 7, 2022
discussed below, stipulations with the parties regarding several disputed issues, and a reduction to the Utility’s forecast for wildfire system hardening mileage
targets over the 2023 to 2026 rate case period.
As amended and updated, the Utility’s application requests revenue requirements of $15.82 billion and a weighted-average GRC rate base of $50.41 billion for
its 2023 test year. The tables below compare the requested revenue requirements and rate base for the GRC period from 2023 through 2026 to those adopted for
2022 in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S proceedings:
(in billions)     2022
(as adopted) 2023 2024 2025 2026
Requested revenue requirement $ 12.21 $ 15.82 $ 16.74 $ 17.18 $ 17.43 
Requested weighted-average GRC rate base 39.21 50.41 55.39 59.56 63.68 
Over the GRC period of 2023 through 2026, the Utility plans to make average annual capital investments of approximately $9.69 billion in gas distribution,
transmission and storage, electric distribution, and electric generation infrastructure, and to improve safety, reliability, and customer service.
79
On July 22, 2022, the Utility submitted a request for the second track of this proceeding, requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related primarily to
the safety and reliability of the Utility’s gas transmission and storage system incurred from January 2015 to December 2021. The recorded expenditures consist
of $206 million in expenses and $129 million in capital expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $241 million, most of
which is proposed to be collected over a two-year period beginning August 1, 2023. On January 6, 2023, the Utility and the Public Advocates Office of the
CPUC filed a motion for approval of a settlement agreement for all amounts at issue in the second track of the proceeding. In the motion, the parties requested
that the CPUC approve $183 million in expense and $127 million of capital expenditures for recovery through rates.
On January 12, 2023, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among the Utility and two parties to the proceeding pursuant to which the Utility’s wildfire
liability insurance will be entirely based on self-insurance beginning in 2023. The self-insurance will be funded through CPUC-jurisdictional rates at
$400 million for test year 2023 and subsequent years until $1.0 billion of unimpaired self-insurance is reached. If losses are incurred, the settlement agreement
contains an adjustment mechanism designed to adjust customer funded self-insurance based on the amount of wildfire related liabilities incurred in the previous
year. For 2024, 2025, and 2026, if the estimated claims for wildfire events from the immediately preceding year exceed the amount collected for self-insurance
in that same year, the self-insurance amount to be collected in rates during the following year would increase by 50% of the difference between the self-
insurance amount collected and estimated claims for events in the immediately preceding year. As a result, the Utility could collect the self-insurance amounts
over a longer period than it makes wildfire-related payments. The settlement agreement includes a five percent deductible, capped at a maximum of
$50 million, on claims that are incurred each year. The settlement agreement prohibits the Utility from purchasing additional wildfire liability insurance from
the commercial insurance market.
The Utility does not seek recovery of compensation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s officers within the scope of 17 Code of Federal Regulations
240.3b-7.
The CPUC’s schedule indicated a final decision on the first two tracks of this proceeding would be issued in the third quarter of 2023.
Cost of Capital Proceedings
2020 and 2022 Cost of Capital Applications
On December 19, 2019, the CPUC approved a final decision in the 2020 cost of capital application (the “2020 cost of capital application”), maintaining the
Utility’s ROE at the 2019 level of 10.25% for the three-year period beginning January 1, 2020. The decision maintained the common equity component of the
Utility’s capital structure (i.e., the relative weightings of common equity, preferred equity, and debt for ratemaking) at 52% and reduced its preferred stock
component from 1% to 0.5%. The decision also approved the cost of debt requested by the Utility.
On August 23, 2021, the Utility filed an off-cycle 2022 cost of capital application with the CPUC. The Utility also concurrently filed a motion requesting that
the revenue requirement for the 2022 cost of capital be recorded in memorandum accounts to be trued-up following a final decision in this proceeding. On
October 28, 2021, the CPUC ruled that the Utility was required to comply with the cost of capital mechanism for 2022.
On November 3, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision, finding that an extraordinary event occurred, and that the cost of capital adjustment mechanism
should not be implemented for 2022. The final decision retains the cost of capital for 2022 previously authorized in the 2020 cost of capital proceeding, as
adjusted, and closes this proceeding. On December 5, 2022, intervenors filed an application for rehearing. On December 20, 2022, the Utility filed a response
to the application for rehearing.
For more information regarding this proceeding, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
2023 Cost of Capital Application
On April 20, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting that the CPUC authorize the Utility’s cost of capital for its electric generation,
electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base beginning on January 1, 2023 (the “2023 cost of capital
application”).
80
In its 2023 cost of capital application, the Utility requested that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposed ratemaking capital structure (i.e., the relative
weightings of common equity, preferred equity, and debt for ratemaking), ROE, cost of preferred stock, and cost of debt.
On December 19, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting a new cost of capital. On January 10, 2023, the CPUC issued a decision correcting certain
typographical errors in the final decision.
The following table compares the currently authorized capital structure and rates of return with those adopted in the final decision for 2023, as corrected.
2022 authorized by the 2022 Cost of Capital
Application2023 Cost of Capital decision
Cost Capital structure Weighted cost Cost Capital structure Weighted cost
Common equity 10.25 % 52.00 % 5.33 % 10.00 % 52.00 % 5.20 %
Preferred stock 5.52 % 0.50 % 0.03 % 5.52 % 0.50 % 0.03 %
Long-term debt 4.17 % 47.50 % 1.98 % 4.31 % 47.50 % 2.05 %
Weighted average cost of capital 100.00 % 7.34 % 100.00 % 7.28 %
For 2023, the Utility expects that the newly-adopted cost of capital will result in revenue requirement decreases of approximately $23 million for electric
generation and distribution and $10 million for gas distribution operations, assuming 2022 authorized rate base amounts from the 2020 GRC decision. The
revenues for the gas transmission and storage operations will decrease by approximately $7 million, assuming 2022 authorized rate base amounts from the
2019 GT&S decision. Actual revenue requirement changes resulting from the Utility’s requested ROE for the period beyond 2022 may differ from the amounts
reflected above, pending the outcome of the 2023 GRC.
The 2023 cost of capital application also requested that the CPUC approve an upward adjustment above the three-month commercial paper rate for interest on
the Utility’s balancing and memorandum accounts to reflect the Utility’s actual cost of short-term debt. The Utility requested that the adjustment be set on an
annual basis effective January 1 of each year based on the average difference between the three-month commercial paper rate and the Utility’s actual cost of
short-term debt over the preceding twelve-month period from November through October. The Utility included an illustrative calculation using the period
March 2021 to February 2022 with an adjustment to increase the rate by 153 basis points, which would result in an estimated $69 million increase in recovery
of short-term financing costs associated with its recent balancing and memorandum account balances. The actual revenue requirement impact of the short-term
debt proposal would differ depending on the final adjustment set each year and the recorded balances in the balancing and memorandum accounts. The
decision deferred consideration of the proposal to a second phase of the proceeding.
The cost of capital that is approved in this proceeding is expected to be effective until December 31, 2025, unless the cost of capital adjustment mechanism is
triggered. (For more information on the cost of capital adjustment mechanism, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)
On January 18, 2023, an intervenor filed an application for rehearing of the final decision. On February 2, 2023, the Utility filed a response to the application
for rehearing.
2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case. The phase one decision excluded from rate base
$696 million of 2011 to 2014 capital spending in excess of the amount adopted in the prior GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million
of that amount and ordered that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek
recovery in a future proceeding. The audit report was released June 2, 2020 and did not recommend any additional disallowances. The 2015 GT&S decision
authorized the Utility to seek recovery, through a separate application, of those costs not recommended for disallowance by the audit.
81
On July 31, 2020, the Utility filed an application seeking recovery of $416 million in 2015 to 2022 revenue associated with $512 million of recorded capital
expenditures. On July 7, 2021, the Utility filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement reached with the active parties in the proceeding. On July 14,
2022, the CPUC approved a final decision approving the settlement agreement, which resolved all issues in this proceeding and authorized a $356 million
revenue requirement for the period of 2015 through 2022. Of this amount, $313 million of revenues for the period 2015 through 2021 will be amortized in rates
over 60 months and $43 million associated with 2022 will be amortized in rates over 12 months beginning August 1, 2022. Going forward, the as-yet
undepreciated capital plant associated with this application was included in test year 2023 rate base in the Utility’s consolidated 2023 GRC.
Transmission Owner Rate Cases
Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases, respectively)
On January 8, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion granting an appeal of the FERC’s decisions in the TO16 and TO17 rate cases that had
granted the Utility a 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for its continued participation in the CAISO. If the FERC concluded on remand that the Utility should
no longer be authorized to receive the 50-basis point ROE incentive adder, the Utility would incur a refund obligation of $1 million and $8.5 million for TO16
and TO17, respectively. Those rate case decisions were remanded to the FERC for further proceedings consistent with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’
opinion.
On July 18, 2019, the FERC issued its order on remand reaffirming its prior grant of the Utility’s request for the 50-basis point ROE adder.
On March 17, 2020, the FERC issued its order denying requests for rehearing that were previously filed by several parties. On May 11, 2020, the CPUC and a
number of other parties filed a petition for review of the FERC’s orders in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
On March 17, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FERC’s order granting the Utility the 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for CAISO
participation. The order would extinguish the Utility’s refund obligations that might have been required under the TO16 and TO17 rate cases had the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals not found in the FERC’s favor. On May 2, 2022, the CPUC filed a petition for panel rehearing of the order. On May 25, 2022, the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision denying the request for rehearing and the request for a rehearing en banc.
Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18” rate case)
On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed its TO18 rate case with the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.72 billion, a
$387 million increase over the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 was $6.7 billion.  The
Utility sought a ROE of 10.9%, which included an incentive component of 50-basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO. 
On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required the
allocation of all common plant between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be based on operating and maintenance labor ratios. The order reopened the record for
the limited purpose of allowing the participants to the proceeding an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodology
adopted in FERC Opinion No. 569-A, issued on May 21, 2020.
On December 17, 2020 and June 17, 2021, the FERC issued orders denying requests for rehearing submitted by the Utility and intervenors. In 2021, the Utility
filed four appeals. The appeals related to two issues: (1) impact of the Tax Act on TO18 rates in January and February 2018 and (2) aspects of the rehearing
order other than the Tax Act. The appeals have been consolidated and are being held in abeyance until the FERC addresses the ROE issue on rehearing.
As a result of an order denying rehearing on the common plant allocation, the Utility increased its regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during
the TO18, TO19, and TO20 rate case periods from 2017 through 2022 by approximately $416 million. A portion of these common plant costs are expected to
be recovered at the CPUC in a separate application and as a result, as of December 31, 2022, the Utility had recorded approximately $258 million to
Regulatory assets.
82
On March 17, 2022, the FERC issued a further order in the TO18 rate case proceeding finding that 9.26% is the just and reasonable base ROE for the Utility.
With the incentive component of 50-basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO, the resulting ROE would be 9.76%. As a result, the
Utility increased its regulatory liability for the potential refund for TO18 by $30 million in 2022. On April 18, 2022, the Utility sought rehearing of the FERC’s
determination of the base ROE finding. On May 16, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the Utility filed a compliance filing and a refund report describing the
adjustments made to the transmission revenue requirement, adjusted rates, and the calculation and mechanism of the refunds. On May 19, 2022, the FERC
denied all parties’ rehearing requests. The Utility has filed an appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, as have the other parties that sought rehearing. The
appeal is being held in abeyance until the FERC issues a substantive order on rehearing on the ROE issue.
Aside from the ultimate outcome of the ROE rehearing request and the common plant allocation, the FERC’s orders in the TO18 proceeding are not expected
to result in a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Some of the issues that will be decided in a
final and unappealable TO18 decision, including the common plant allocation, will also be incorporated into the Utility’s TO19 and TO20 rate cases. The ROE
rehearing request will not impact the TO20 rate case. See “Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund” in Note 16 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19” rate case)
On July 27, 2017, the Utility filed its TO19 rate case with the FERC. On December 20, 2018, the FERC issued an order approving an all-party settlement filed
by the Utility. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon
the issuance of a final, non-appealable TO18 decision. On March 17, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FERC’s order granting the Utility the
50-basis point ROE incentive adder for CAISO participation and eliminating the refund obligation, and so the Utility was not obligated to make a refund to
customers based on this matter. See “Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016” above for a discussion of the incentive adder. As a result of the
potential reduction to the TO18 revenue requirement, the Utility increased its regulatory liability for the potential refund for TO19 by $32 million in the first
quarter of 2022. On April 18, 2022, the Utility sought rehearing of the FERC’s determination of the base ROE finding.
Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2019 (the “TO20” rate case)
On October 1, 2018, the Utility filed its TO20 rate case with the FERC requesting approval of a formula rate for the costs associated with the Utility’s electric
transmission facilities. On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s October 2018 filing, subject to hearings and refund, and
established May 1, 2019 as the effective date for rate changes. The FERC also ordered that the hearings be held in abeyance pending settlement discussions
among the parties.
On March 31, 2020, the Utility filed a partial settlement with the FERC, which the FERC approved on August 17, 2020. On October 15, 2020, the Utility filed
a settlement with the FERC resolving all of the remaining issues in the formula rate proceedings, including the Utility’s ROE, capital structure, depreciation
rates, as well as certain other aspects of the Utility’s formula rate. Specifically, the settlement established an all-in ROE of 10.45%; a fixed capital structure of
49.75% common stock, 49.75% debt, and 0.5% preferred stock; and fixed depreciation rates for various categories of transmission facilities (represented by
individual FERC accounts). The term of the settlement continues until December 31, 2023 and the Utility will be required to file a replacement rate filing by
October 18, 2023 to be effective on January 1, 2024.
On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved the settlement without modification.
Some of the issues that will be decided in a final and unappealable TO18 decision, including the common plant allocation, will also be incorporated into the
Utility’s TO20 rate case.
Under its formula rate, the Utility submits an annual update to the FERC each December for rates to go into effect on January 1 of the following year. Parties
have protested the Utility’s annual updates, and these protests are pending before the FERC.

Other Regulatory Proceedings
Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process
In the OII to Consider PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Plan of Reorganization final decision, the CPUC adopted an EOEP designed to provide a roadmap
for how the CPUC will monitor the Utility’s operational performance on an ongoing basis. The EOEP contains six steps that are triggered by specific events
and includes enhanced reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight. These trigger events include failure to obtain an approved WMP, failure
to comply with regulatory reporting requirements in the WMP, insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments and failure to comply
with or demonstrate sufficient progress toward certain metrics. The EOEP also contains provisions for the Utility to cure and permanently exit the EOEP if it
can satisfy specific criteria. If the Utility is placed into the EOEP, actions taken would occur in coordination with the CPUC’s existing formal and informal
reporting requirements and procedures. The EOEP does not replace or limit the CPUC’s regulatory authority, including the authority to issue Orders to Show
Cause and OIIs and to impose fines and penalties. The EOEP requires the Utility to report the occurrence of a triggering event to the CPUC’s executive director
no later than five business days after the date on which any member of senior management of the Utility becomes aware of the occurrence of a triggering event.
The Utility is unable to predict whether fines or penalties may be imposed, or other regulatory actions may be taken.
Vegetation Management
The CPUC placed the Utility into step 1 of the EOEP on April 15, 2021 and imposed additional reporting requirements on the Utility. The CPUC’s resolution
states that a step 1 triggering event had occurred because the Utility had “made insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments related
to its electric business.” The resolution found that, based on the CPUC’s evaluation of the Utility’s EVM work in 2020, the Utility was “not sufficiently
prioritizing its Enhanced Vegetation Management (“EVM”) based on risk” and was “not making risk-driven investments.” The resolution also found that “less
than five percent of the EVM work” the Utility completed in 2020 “was on the 20 highest risk power lines according to its own risk rankings.”
As required by the CPUC’s resolution, the Utility submitted a corrective action plan to the CPUC’s Executive Director on May 6, 2021, which was designed to
correct or prevent recurrence of the step 1 triggering event, or otherwise mitigate any ongoing safety risk or impact, as soon as practicable, among other things.
The corrective action plan addressed the EVM situation that occurred in 2020 and provided a risk-informed EVM work plan for 2021. The Utility was required
to update the information contained in the corrective action plan every 90 days, which it did.
On December 1, 2022, the CPUC issued a resolution authorizing the Utility’s exit from the EOEP.
Application for Post-Emergence SB 901 Securitization Transaction
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate so
that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and
safe service. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as
“securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in
excess of the CHT.
Pursuant to SB 901 and the CPUC’s methodology adopted in the CHT OIR, on April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking
authorization for a post-emergence transaction to recover $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs through securitization that is designed to be rate neutral to
customers through the creation of a corresponding customer credit trust, with the proceeds used to pay or reimburse the Utility for the payment of wildfire
claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. Among other uses, as a result of the proposed transaction, the Utility would retire
$6.0 billion of Utility debt. Specifically, the application requested administration of the stress test methodology approved in the CHT OIR and a determination
that $7.5 billion in 2017 catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs and eligible for securitization. In this context, a “securitization” refers to a
financing transaction where a special purpose financing vehicle issues new debt that is secured by the proceeds of a new recovery charge to Utility customers.
The application also proposed a customer credit designed to equal the bond charges over the life of the bonds, which would insulate customers from the charge
on customer bills associated with the bonds.
84
On April 23, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision finding that $7.5 billion of the Utility’s 2017 catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs that
may be financed through the issuance of recovery bonds pursuant to Public Utilities Code sections 850 et seq. and approving a structure for the transaction. As
requested, the decision authorized the Utility to establish a customer credit trust funded by PG&E Corporation’s shareholders, that will provide a monthly
credit to customers that is anticipated to equal the securitized charges such that the securitization is designed to be rate neutral to customers. Subject to
retention of the CPUC’s existing jurisdiction, the decision adopted a transaction structure comprised of four elements: (1) an initial shareholder contribution of
$2.0 billion, $1.0 billion of which was contributed in 2022 and $1.0 billion to be contributed in 2024; (2) up to $7.59 billion of additional contributions funded
by certain shareholder tax benefits; (3) a single CPUC review of the balance of the customer credit trust in 2040, with a single contingent supplemental
shareholder contribution, if needed, up to $775 million in 2040; and (4) sharing with customers 25% of any surplus of shareholder assets in the customer credit
trust at the end of the life of the trust.
In addition, on January 6, 2021, the Utility filed an additional application requesting that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing the issuance of one or
more series of recovery bonds in connection with the post-emergence transaction to finance, using securitization, the $7.5 billion of claims associated with the
2017 Northern California wildfires, which the CPUC subsequently granted on May 11, 2021.
On February 28, 2022, the decision finding $7.5 billion of stress test costs eligible for securitization and the financing order authorizing the issuance of up to
$7.5 billion of recovery bonds became final and non-appealable. The financing order authorized the issuance of bonds through the end of 2022. PG&E Wildfire
Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds on May 10, 2022 and $3.9 billion aggregate principal
amount of Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds on July 20, 2022. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Application for Second AB 1054 Securitization Transaction
AB 1054 provides that the first $5.0 billion expended in the aggregate by California’s three large electric IOUs on fire risk mitigation capital expenditures
included in their respective approved WMPs will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The $5.0 billion of capital expenditures has been
allocated among the large electric IOUs in accordance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics. The Utility’s allocation is $3.21 billion. AB 1054
contemplates that such capital expenditures may be financed using a structure that securitizes a dedicated customer charge. Pursuant to an earlier financing
order issued by the CPUC authorizing the Utility’s initial application for AB 1054 securitization transaction, on November 12, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding
LLC issued approximately $860 million of senior secured recovery bonds. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
On March 11, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a second transaction to securitize up to $1.7 billion of fire risk
mitigation capital expenditure amounts that have been or would be incurred by the Utility from 2019 through 2022. The $1.7 billion reflected $212 million
recorded and $1.16 billion forecasted capital expenditure amounts that were approved by the CPUC in the 2020 GRC and up to $350 million capital
expenditure amounts pending in the 2020 WMCE proceeding. On May 4, 2022, the $350 million of capital expenditure amounts were removed because the
CPUC extended the schedule in the 2020 WMCE proceeding such that a final decision approving such capital expenditure amounts in that proceeding was no
longer expected prior to the issuance of a financing order authorizing the second AB 1054 securitization transaction.  The final amount to be securitized would
be based on actual recorded capital expenditures incurred by the Utility prior to the securitization transaction.
The application requested that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing one or more series of recovery bonds, determine that the issuance of the bonds and
collection through fixed recovery charges is just and reasonable, consistent with the public interest, would reduce rates on a present-value basis compared to
traditional utility financing mechanisms, and authorize the Utility to collect a non-bypassable charge sufficient to pay debt service on the recovery bonds.  The
application also requested that the CPUC exclude the securitized debt from the Utility’s ratemaking capital structure and adjust the Utility’s 2020 GRC revenue
requirements following the issuance of the recovery bonds. 
On August 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the securitization of up to approximately $1.4 billion of fire risk mitigation capital
expenditures, which was the amount requested in the application less the $350 million then pending in the 2020 WMCE proceeding.
On November 30, 2022, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Senior Secured
Recovery Bonds.
85
2020-2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan
The Utility’s 2022 WMP was submitted on February 25, 2022. The 2022 WMP addressed the Utility’s wildfire safety programs and initiatives focused on
reducing the potential for catastrophic wildfires related to electrical equipment, reducing the potential for fires to spread, and reducing the impact of PSPS
events. On November 10, 2022, OEIS approved the Utility’s 2022 WMP. On December 15, 2022, the CPUC ratified OEIS’s approval.
On December 5, 2022, OEIS issued its draft Annual Report on Compliance (“ARC”) for the Utility’s 2020 WMP. In the draft ARC, OEIS found that the Utility
undertook significant efforts to reduce its wildfire risk and, in many instances, achieved its stated objectives and targets but found that the Utility failed to meet
targets highly correlated with risk, failed to achieve critical stated objectives, and failed to sufficiently address risk on its system. Consequently, OEIS found the
Utility did not substantially comply with the WMP during the 2020 compliance period. The Utility submitted comments on the draft ARC in December 2022. If
the OEIS final ARC report maintains the finding that the Utility failed to substantially comply with its 2020 WMP, the Utility may seek judicial review. If the
ARC finds that the Utility did not substantially comply with the WMP during the 2020 compliance period, the CPUC is required to issue penalties for the
finding of noncompliance. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot reasonably estimate at this time whether they will incur a loss in connection with the ARC
or the amount of any such loss, as OEIS has not issued the final ARC and because any penalty issued by CPUC depends upon a number of factors.
Electric Integrated Resource Planning and Related Procurement
On November 13, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision that takes a number of steps to address the potential for system RA shortages beginning in 2021. The
decision required incremental procurement of system-level qualifying RA capacity of 3,300 MWs by all LSEs operating within the CAISO’s balancing area for
the period from 2021 to 2023, of which the Utility is responsible for 716.9 MWs for its bundled customer portion. The decision required that at least 50% of
LSEs resource responsibilities come online by August 1, 2021, at least 75% by August 1, 2022, and the remaining by August 1, 2023. Additionally, the decision
directed the IOUs to act as the backstop procurement agent for CCAs and energy service providers that choose not to voluntarily self-procure or that fail to
meet their procurement responsibilities after electing to self-provide their assigned MWs of system RA capacity under the decision.
On June 30, 2021, the CPUC issued a mid-term reliability decision to address incremental electric system reliability needs between 2024 and 2026 due to, in
part, the pending retirement of once-through-cooling natural gas plants in Southern California and the possible retirement of Diablo Canyon by requiring at
least 11,500 MW of additional net qualifying capacity to be procured by LSEs. See “Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations” below. The decision set
procurement requirements of 2,000 MW by 2023, an additional 6,000 MW by 2024, an additional 1,500 MW by 2025, and an additional 2,000 MW by 2026.
The decision set the Utility’s share of the procurement at 2,302 MW of incremental net qualifying capacity.
On April 21, 2022, the CPUC approved a group of nine long-term RA agreements to meet a portion of the Utility’s procurement requirements under the
CPUC’s mid-term reliability decision. The agreements are each for a term of 15 years and collectively expected to supply 1,598.7 MW of lithium-ion energy
storage capacity with some projects expected to be operational in 2023 and others in 2024.
OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs
On August 17, 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor to the existing NEM tariffs. The successor tariff is being developed
pursuant to the requirements of AB 327. Under AB 327, the successor to the existing NEM tariffs should provide customer-generators with credit or
compensation for electricity generated by their renewable facilities based on the value of that generation to all customers and allow customer-sited renewable
generation to grow sustainably among different types of customers.
86
On November 10, 2022, the CPUC withdrew a previously-issued PD and issued a new PD. On December 19, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision. The final
decision will reduce the NEM subsidy by, in large part, reducing the bill credits for exported energy to avoided cost levels for new customers interconnecting
under the successor tariff established by the final decision. For new non-CARE customers interconnecting under the successor tariff, the subsidy is reduced by
about 60% for standalone solar and about 45% for solar-paired storage. The decision will also reduce the subsidy for new commercial customers
interconnecting under the successor tariff by about 35%. The decision declined to adopt a charge to recover grid and infrastructure costs for new or existing
customers and, instead, defers to the ongoing Demand Flexibility OIR, which is considering income-based fixed charges for all customers. The decision does,
however, clarify that charges adopted in the Demand Flexibility OIR will apply to NEM and successor tariff customers. The final decision does not reform the
legacy period for existing NEM customers.
On January 18, 2023, intervenors filed an application for rehearing. On February 2, 2023, the Utility filed a response to the application for rehearing.
Application with Pacific Generation LLC for Approval to Transfer Non-Nuclear Generation Assets
On September 28, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC regarding the separation of the Utility’s non-nuclear generation assets into a newly
formed, stand-alone Utility subsidiary, Pacific Generation. The application, which was filed jointly with Pacific Generation, seeks to establish Pacific
Generation as a separate, rate-regulated utility subject to regulation by the CPUC and contemplates the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific
Generation to one or more investors to be identified. The application proposes that the negotiated transaction documents would be submitted to the CPUC via
an advice letter.
On December 13, 2022, the Utility filed applications with a similar request with the FERC and also filed a related application with the FERC requesting the
transfer of certain hydro licenses to Pacific Generation.
On January 20, 2023, the CPUC issued a scoping memo pursuant to which a PD would be issued by November 2023.
Self-Reports to the CPUC
The Utility self-reports potential violations of certain requirements to the CPUC. The Utility could face penalties, enforcement actions, or other adverse legal or
regulatory consequences for these potential violations, including under the EOEP. The Utility is unable to predict the likelihood and the amount of potential
fines or penalties, if any, related to these matters.
Electric Asset Inspections
The Utility has notified the CPUC of various errors relating to inspections and maintenance of its electric assets or implementation of WMP initiatives. These
notices include missed inspections or the inability to locate records evidencing performance of inspections required under CPUC GOs 95 and 165 and errors
regarding reporting meeting targets set by the Utility’s 2020 WMP. In these notices, the Utility describes the failures and corrective actions the Utility is taking
to remediate these issues and to prevent recurrence. Among other corrective measures, the Utility has developed short-term and longer-term systemic corrective
actions to address these errors, including performing enhanced inspections for poles with outdated or incomplete GO 165 inspection records and strengthening
the Utility’s asset registry, as well as corrective actions regarding reporting on the progress toward WMP targets.
On October 26, 2022, the Utility notified the CPUC that the Utility’s procedure for wood pole replacements did not comply with CPUC requirements for
replacement of poles under certain conditions and, accordingly, in some instances, the Utility failed to replace wood poles with safety factors below the
required minimum. Among other short- and longer-term corrective measures, the Utility is replacing identified poles on a risk prioritized basis and revising its
wood pole replacement procedures in alignment with CPUC requirements. On December 22, 2022, the Utility submitted an update to the CPUC explaining the
Utility had identified a population of wood poles that had not received intrusive inspections in accordance with GO 165’s deadlines due to legacy issues, which
should no longer be an issue due to changes in Utility procedures. In addition to its plan to complete the intrusive tests by September 30, 2023, the Utility is
performing an end-to-end assessment of the wood pole test and treat program to proactively identify and address potential issues.
The Utility continues to evaluate whether there are additional failures to comply with GO 95 and 165, beyond those identified in submitted self-reports. The
Utility intends to update the CPUC upon completion of its reviews and to address any issues it identifies.
87
Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Safety Culture
On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility
prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards (the “Safety Culture OII”). The CPUC
directed the SED to evaluate the Utility’s and PG&E Corporation’s organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation
to the Utility’s record of operations, including its record of safety incidents.
On June 18, 2019, the CPUC issued a ruling requesting comments from parties on four proposals that it stated may improve the safety culture of PG&E
Corporation and the Utility. The four proposals are: separating the Utility into gas and electric utilities (including, as one possibility, sale of the gas assets to a
third party); establishing periodic review of the Utility’s certificate of convenience and necessity; modifying or eliminating PG&E Corporation’s holding
company structure; and linking the Utility’s rate of return or ROE to safety performance metrics.
On September 4, 2020, the administrative law judge issued a ruling updating case status, which states that the proceeding will remain open as a vehicle to
monitor the progress of the Utility in improving its safety culture and to address any relevant issues that arise, with the CPUC’s consultant continuing in a
monitoring role. The ruling states that additional issues may be raised in the proceedings by parties or the CPUC.
Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations
On September 2, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030,
with the potential for an earlier retirement date. Under the legislation, the Utility would continue to operate Diablo Canyon on behalf of all CPUC-jurisdictional
LSEs, and all customers of those LSEs would be responsible for the cost of extended operations. Additionally, the State of California has authorized a loan of
up to $1.4 billion pursuant to SB 846 to the Utility from the DWR to support the extension of plant operations, which is in addition to the amount discussed in
“Assembly Bill 180”, below. SB 846 further directs the Utility to take steps to secure funds from the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program, and any other
potentially available federal funding, to repay the loan. The loan may be forgiven under certain circumstances. On October 18, 2022, the Utility executed the
loan agreement with the DWR.
On September 2, 2022, the Utility applied for federal funding through the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program. On November 17, 2022, the DOE conditionally
selected the Utility to receive funding of up to $1.1 billion as part of the program. Final terms are subject to negotiation and finalization by the DOE. SB 846
provides that within 180 days of the filing of the DOE application, the CEC, in consultation with the CAISO and the CPUC, shall make a determination in a
public process of whether the state’s electricity forecasts for the calendar years from 2024 through 2030 show potential for reliability deficiencies if Diablo
Canyon operations are not extended beyond 2025 and whether extending operations of Diablo Canyon until 2030 is prudent to ensure reliability in light of any
potential for supply deficiency. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Utility adjusted the ARO to reflect extended operations of Diablo Canyon
through 2030. However, the Utility’s ARO could be materially impacted if the Utility does not receive the required federal and state licenses, permits, and
approvals.
During the period prior to extended operations, the bill authorizes a monthly performance-based disbursement equal to $7 for each MWh generated by Diablo
Canyon. The performance-based disbursement will be paid from the loan proceeds authorized by SB 846 and is contingent upon the Utility’s ongoing pursuit of
extension of the operating period and continued safe and reliable Diablo Canyon operations. The performance-based disbursement cannot be realized as
shareholder profits or paid out as dividends.
During the period of extended operations and in lieu of the traditional rate-based return on investment, the bill provides for a fixed payment of $50 million, in
2022 dollars, for each of Diablo Canyon’s Unit 1 and Unit 2 for each year of extended operations to be recovered from customers of all CPUC-jurisdictional
LSEs, which is potentially subject to adjustment downward in the event of extended unplanned outages. In addition, the bill authorizes a volumetric payment
totaling $13, in 2022 dollars, for each MWh generated by Diablo Canyon during the period of extended operations, with the first half recovered from all
CPUC-jurisdictional LSEs and the second half from customers in the Utility’s service area. The amount of the fixed and volumetric payments will be adjusted
annually by the CPUC using CPUC-approved escalation methodologies and adjustment factors. The volumetric payment cannot be realized as shareholder
profits or paid out as dividends, to the extent it is not needed for Diablo Canyon. The legislation includes language that limits use of the volumetric payment to
investments in the system and for customers that address critical state priorities.
88
The CPUC has initiated a rulemaking proceeding in January 2023 to develop a new mechanism to recover costs from customers of all CPUC-jurisdictional
LSEs for the continued operation of Diablo Canyon and to address other issues associated with continued operation, including cost responsibility if Diablo
Canyon is unable to operate. The legislation also established a $300 million Liquidated Damages Balancing Account (“LDBA”) to be funded over time by all
CPUC-jurisdictional customers. The LDBA provides a source for paying for replacement power costs, if incurred, due to unplanned outages at Diablo Canyon
as a result of the Utility’s failure to meet the CPUC’s reasonable-manager standard.
The key remaining steps to continued operations include NRC license renewal and approval from California state agencies. If either is not received, the Utility
would retire Unit 1 in 2024 and Unit 2 in 2025 as previously approved by the CPUC. On October 31, 2022, the Utility requested that the NRC resume its
review of a license renewal application the Utility voluntarily withdrew and terminated in 2018 or else grant an exemption to permit operations to continue at
Diablo Canyon after the expiration of each of its current operating licenses and until the NRC completes its review of the license renewal application. On
January 24, 2023, the NRC staff declined to resume its review of the previously-withdrawn application and directed the Utility to submit a new application for
license renewal, which the Utility expects to do by the end of 2023. The NRC staff has stated that it will provide a response to the Utility’s request for an
exemption in March 2023. Consistent with SB 846, the CPUC, the CEC, California State Lands Commission, California Coastal Commission, and other state
agencies will need to determine that extended operations represent an appropriate path to meet California’s reliability, affordability, and environmental goals.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES
Assembly Bill 180
On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 180, which authorized the DWR to use up to $75 million to support contracts with the owners of
electric generating facilities pending retirement, such as Diablo Canyon, to fund, reimburse or compensate the owner for any costs, expenses or financial
commitments incurred to retain the future availability of such generating facilities pending further legislation.
Assembly Bill 205
On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 205, which included authorization for additional incremental CAPP funding of $958 million for
California IOUs. The Utility received approximately $200 million in November 2022 to reduce the amounts owed by customer accounts in arrears. The amount
of funding was determined by the California Department of Community Services and Development, which is the agency responsible for administering the
CAPP.
Senate Bill 846
On September 2, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030,
with the potential for an earlier retirement date. For more information, see “Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations” above.
Senate Bill 884
On September 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 884, which authorizes and expedites OEIS and CPUC review of a 10-year undergrounding plan.
Under SB 884, large electrical corporations may submit 10-year plans for undergrounding distribution infrastructure in Tier 2 or 3 HFTDs or rebuild areas to
OEIS. The plan must include an evaluation of project costs, projected economic benefits over the life of the assets, and any cost-containment assumptions,
including the economies of scale necessary to reduce wildfire risk and mitigation costs and establish a sustainable supply chain. OEIS will have up to nine
months to review and approve or deny the plan, and then the CPUC will have up to nine months to review and approve or deny the plan, including its costs.
89
Inflation Reduction Act
On August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed the Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a 15% corporate alternative
minimum tax (“CAMT”) on the adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year
period, effective January 1, 2023. The law also extends and modifies existing tax credits and creates new tax credits for renewable and clean energy sources.
Many aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, including the CAMT, remain uncertain and the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service
have been granted broad authority to enact regulations implementing its provisions. Depending on the guidance issued, PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s
federal income tax liability could increase substantially. PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to evaluate the impact of the law and its potential
implications.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health
of the Utility’s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous
substances; the reporting and reduction of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of
safety and reliability measures for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. See Item 1A. Risk
Factors, “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1. and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownership of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices,
interest rates, and counterparty credit. The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives,
discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading
purposes (i.e., risk mitigation) and not for speculative purposes.
Commodity Price Risk
The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and
nuclear fuel necessary for electricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers. The Utility’s risk management activities include the use of
physical and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements. As long as the Utility can conclude
that it is probable that its reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and
natural gas prices do not affect earnings. Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core
customers are also fully recoverable through a ratemaking mechanism.
The Utility’s current authorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account
protected. The Utility recovers these costs in its GRC through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts, resulting in price and
volumetric risk. The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s value-at-risk was approximately $3 million and
$5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of
price risk management activities.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in
market interest rates. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, if interest rates changed by one percent for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term
debt, short-term debt, and cash investments, the pre-tax impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $54 million and $76 million, respectively,
based on net variable rate debt and other interest rate-sensitive instruments outstanding. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 for further discussion of interest rates.

Energy Procurement Credit Risk
The Utility conducts business with counterparties mainly in the energy industry to purchase electricity or gas and related services, including the CAISO market,
other California IOUs, municipal utilities, energy trading companies, pipelines, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas
production companies located in the United States and Canada. If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas and
related services, then the Utility may find it necessary to procure electricity or gas at current market prices or seek alternate services, which may be higher than
the contract prices.
The Utility manages credit risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit
ratings, and other credit criteria as deemed appropriate. Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically. The Utility executes many energy contracts
under master commodity enabling agreements that may require security. Security may be in the form of cash or letters of credit. The Utility may accept other
forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by the
Utility). Security or performance assurance may be required from the Utility or counterparties when current net receivables or payables and exposure exceed
contractually specified limits.
The following table summarizes the Utility’s energy procurement credit risk exposure to its counterparties:

Exposure is the positive exposure maximum that equals mark-to-market value on physically and financially settled contracts, plus net receivables (payables) where netting is contractually allowed
minus collateral posted by counterparties and held by the Utility plus collateral posted by the Utility and held by the counterparties. For purposes of this table, parental guarantees are not included
as part of the calculation. Exposure amounts reported above do not include adjustments for time value or liquidity.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The
accounting policies described below are considered to be critical accounting estimates due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant
and material to the financial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material
judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. These accounting estimates and their key characteristics
are outlined below.
Contributions to the Wildfire Fund
The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with (i) $10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds supported by a 15-year extension of the DWR charge to customers,
(ii) $7.5 billion in initial contributions from California’s three large electric IOUs, and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid by California’s three large
electric IOUs for a 10-year period. The contributions from the IOUs will be effectively borne by their respective shareholders, as they will not be permitted to
recover these costs through rates. The costs of the initial and annual contributions are allocated among the IOUs pursuant to a “Wildfire Fund allocation
metric” set forth in AB 1054 based on land area in the applicable IOU’s service area classified as HFTDs and adjusted to account for risk mitigation efforts.
The Utility’s Wildfire Fund allocation metric is 64.2% (representing an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and annual contributions of
approximately $193 million). (1) 
(1) 
91
On the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility contributed, in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and
first annual contribution of approximately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund to secure participation of the Utility therein. The other large electric IOUs made
their initial contributions to the Wildfire Fund in September 2019. On December 30, 2021 and 2022, the Utility made its third and fourth annual contributions
of $193 million each to the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have six remaining annual contributions of
$193 million (based on the current Wildfire Fund allocation metric). PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for contributions to the Wildfire Fund by
capitalizing an asset, amortizing to periods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage, and incrementally adjusting for accelerated amortization as the
level of coverage declines, as further described below.
As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $935 million in Other non-current liabilities,
$460 million in current assets - Wildfire Fund asset, and $4.8 billion in non-current assets - Wildfire Fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $477 million and $517 million, respectively. The
amortization of the asset, accretion of the liability, and acceleration of the amortization of the asset is reflected in Wildfire Fund expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Expected contributions recorded in Wildfire Fund asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are discounted to the present value using the
10-year U.S. treasury rate at the date PG&E Corporation and the Utility satisfied all the eligibility requirements to participate in the Wildfire Fund. A useful life
of 15 years is being used to amortize the Wildfire Fund asset.
AB 1054 did not specify a period of coverage; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates. In estimating
the period of coverage, PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a Monte Carlo simulation that began with 12 years of historical, publicly available fire-loss data
from wildfires caused by electrical equipment, and subsequently plan to add an additional year of data each following year. The period of historic fire-loss data
and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts by the California electric utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the useful life. These
assumptions along with the other assumptions below create a high degree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund. The simulation
creates annual distributions of potential losses due to fires that could be attributed to the participating electric utilities. Initial use of five years of historical data,
with average annual statewide claims or settlements of approximately $6.5 billion versus 12 years of historical data, with average annual statewide claims or
settlements of approximately $2.9 billion, would have resulted in a six year amortization period. As of December 31, 2022, a 5% change to the assumption
around current and future mitigation effort effectiveness would increase the amortization period by five years assuming greater effectiveness and would
decrease the amortization period by four years assuming less effectiveness.
Other assumptions used to estimate the useful life include the estimated cost of wildfires caused by participating electric utilities, the amount at which wildfire
claims would be settled, the likely adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires and determination of any amounts required to be
reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, the impacts of climate change, the level of future insurance coverage held by the electric utilities, the FERC-allocable portion
of loss recovery, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of participating electric utilities. Significant changes in any of these
estimates could materially impact the amortization period.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate all assumptions quarterly and upon claims being made from the Wildfire Fund for catastrophic wildfires, and the
expected life of the Wildfire Fund will be adjusted as required. The Wildfire Fund is available to other participating utilities in California and the amount of
claims that a participating utility incurs is not limited to their individual contribution amounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess the Wildfire Fund asset
for acceleration of the amortization of the asset in the event that a participating utility’s electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a
catastrophic wildfire. Timing of any such acceleration of the amortization of the asset could lag as the emergence of sufficient cause and claims information can
take many quarters and could be limited to public disclosure of the participating electric utility, if ignition were to occur outside the Utility’s service area. There
were fires in the Utility’s and other participating utilities’ services territories since July 12, 2019, including fires for which the cause is unknown, which may in
the future be determined to be covered by the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $175 million in Other
noncurrent assets for Wildfire Fund receivables related to the 2021 Dixie fire. PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $6 million and $43 million of
accelerated amortization, reflected in Wildfire Fund expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
For more information, see “Contributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054” in Note 3 and “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 15 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Loss Contingencies
As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded material accruals for various wildfire-related, enforcement and legal matters, and
environmental remediation liabilities. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.
Wildfire-Related Liabilities
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to potential liabilities related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a wildfire-related liability
when they determine that a loss is probable and they can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The provision is based on the lower end of the range,
unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.
Potential liabilities related to wildfires depend on various factors, including negotiations and settlements or the cause of each fire, contributing causes of the
fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of
such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature and extent of
any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the
Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There are a number of
unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be
asserted against PG&E Corporation or the Utility. For example, the Utility’s wildfire-related accruals have changed in the past as new facts and information
became available to the Utility, including the availability of new evidence and additional information about the scope and nature of damages.
The process for estimating wildfire-related liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective
factors, including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  See Note 15 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Enforcement and Litigation Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims
and lawsuits. In addition, penalties may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility
record a provision for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount
within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a
range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are
adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other
information and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs,
which are expensed as incurred. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. See Note 15 and Note 16 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Loss Recoveries
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recovery mechanisms available for wildfire liabilities including from insurance, through rates, and from the Wildfire
Fund. The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party claims. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a
receivable for a recovery when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur and they can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  The
assessment of whether recovery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series of
complex judgments about future events.  Loss recoveries are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information,
including contractual liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, conversations with the Wildfire Fund
administrators, the CPUC and FERC, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 15 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
93
Environmental Remediation Liabilities
The Utility is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to
pay for environmental remediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party. Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of
hazardous substances at various potential sites, including former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for the
storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.
The Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a
potential site requiring remedial action. (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns
in cooperation with regulatory agencies. For example, the Utility has a program related to certain former MGP sites.) Based on such notification, the Utility
completes an assessment of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred. The Utility records an
environmental remediation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses.
Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process
for estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment. Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and
types of hazardous substances at a potential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in
proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.
When possible, the Utility estimates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending
on the level of information available. Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees
who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to the remediation effort. These estimated costs include remedial site investigations,
remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to
remediate the site. Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the
remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remediation effort.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $1.3 billion each. The Utility’s undiscounted
future costs could increase to as much as $2.3 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other
potentially responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond
regulatory requirements. Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs
may vary significantly from actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are
recognized.
Regulatory Accounting
As a regulated entity, the Utility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers.
Despite the ongoing losses related to wildfires (see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), there is no actual or anticipated
change in the cost-of-service regulation of the Utility’s operations. Therefore, the Utility continues to apply the accounting ASC 980, Regulated Operations.
These amounts would otherwise be recorded to expense or income under GAAP. Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 3 as well as Note 4
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets
(including current regulatory balancing accounts receivable) of $20.0 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable)
of $20.4 billion.
Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory
hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. For some of the
Utility’s regulatory assets, including utility retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the
CPUC. The Utility also records a regulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that
recovery of incurred costs is probable, such as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss,
net of gain, on reacquired debt. If the Utility determined that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if
the Utility ceased to be subject to rate regulation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made. If
regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the
differences in the timing of expense or revenue recognition.
94
A portion of the Utility’s regulatory asset balances relate to items which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting from
catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a
memorandum account, and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudently
incurred. These accounts, which include the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA among others, allow the Utility to
track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. In addition, the CPPMA and RUBA
accounts track costs incurred to implement the CPUC’s Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer Protections
to Support California Customers During the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Utility generally believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires
CPUC authorization in separate proceedings or through a GRC. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Application for Recovery of Costs Recorded
in the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account” and “Regulatory Matters - Catastrophic Event Memorandum Accounts and Applications” above.
Additionally, SB 901 provides a mechanism for the CPUC to potentially allow recovery in future rates, through a securitization mechanism, of wildfire-related
costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the CHT. The Utility must
evaluate the likelihood of recovery in future rates each period. In 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a regulatory asset associated with SB 901.
As of December 31, 2022, the SB 901 regulatory asset was approximately $5.4 billion.
In addition, regulatory accounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking
purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regarding
probability of recovery, as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are
expected to exceed the amount to be recovered.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans,
estimates included in third-party contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a
variety of other factors. 
Asset Retirement Obligations
PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair
value and its settlement date can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the related long-lived asset. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs
recovered through the ratemaking process. See Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
To estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,
inflation rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the
risk associated with the decommissioning obligation.
At December 31, 2022, the Utility’s recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was approximately $5.9 billion. Changes in these
estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement health
care and medical plans for eligible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and
retirees. Adjustments to the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results. These
amounts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between pension
benefit expense recognized in accordance with GAAP, and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as
amounts are probable of recovery through rates. To the extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability. See
Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
95
The pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date. The significant
actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the
health care cost trend rate, and the expected return on plan assets. PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust
them as necessary. While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan
changes or amendments, or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and
future plan expenses. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
In establishing health care cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts. This
evaluation suggests that current rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near term. In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and
given the design of PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2023 was 6.5%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of
approximately 4.5% in 2031 and beyond.
Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset
allocations of the employee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets. Returns on fixed-income debt investments were
projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate. Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of
dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term inflation rate. For the Utility’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.1% compares
to a ten-year actual return of 5.8%.
The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 848 Aa-grade non-
callable bonds at December 31, 2022. This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for
the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

Utility and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements apply to both PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources
on a consolidated basis (i.e., the companies operate in one segment).
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of
Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to
the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities, wildfire-related liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, the Wildfire Fund, environmental remediation
liabilities, AROs, wildfire-related receivables, and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan obligations. Management believes that its estimates and
assumptions reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate and reasonable. A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could
result in an adjustment that would have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows during the period in which such change occurred.
NOTE 2: BANKRUPTCY FILING
Chapter 11 Proceedings
On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility commenced the Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court. Prior to the Emergence Date, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility continued to operate their business as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
On June 20, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan filed on June 19, 2020. PG&E Corporation and the Utility
emerged from Chapter 11 on the Emergence Date of July 1, 2020. Certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order, including the
Ad Hoc Committee of Holders of Trade Claims (the “Trade Committee”). The Trade Committee appealed the Confirmation Order’s holding, which awarded
post-petition interest on general unsecured claims at the federal judgment rate of 2.59%. The Trade Committee is seeking for its members to receive post-
petition interest at the rates specified under their contracts or the rate established under California state law, which is 10%. The Bankruptcy Court and the
federal district court held that the Trade Committee’s members are entitled to post-petition interest at the federal judgment rate. On June 8, 2021, the Trade
Committee appealed the federal district court decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 29, 2022, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed the federal district court decision 2-1. On September 12, 2022, the Utility filed a petition for en banc review, which was denied on
October 5, 2022. On February 2, 2023, the Utility filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the post-petition interest matter, but the amount of that loss is not reasonably
estimable at this time. If the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision is not reversed, then the matter would be remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to evaluate
the rate of interest for each individual contract, the conditions under which the contract rate applies, and whether payment of interest under state law would be
warranted for each contract and claimant. These proceedings therefore will require extensive discovery and motion practice before the Bankruptcy Court with
respect to each of these claims on a variety of contractual issues and equitable considerations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the
timing and outcome of these proceedings or any further appeals.
Except as otherwise set forth in the Plan, the Confirmation Order or another order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition liabilities were
discharged under the Plan.
111
Unresolved Chapter 11 Claims
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received over 100,000 proofs of claim since January 29, 2019, of which approximately 80,000 were channeled to a
trust for the benefit of holders of certain subrogation claims (the “Subrogation Wildfire Trust”) and the Fire Victim Trust. The claims channeled to the
Subrogation Wildfire Trust and Fire Victim Trust will be resolved by such trusts, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility have no further liability in connection
with such claims. PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue their review and analysis of certain remaining claims, including asserted litigation claims, trade
creditor claims, along with other tax and regulatory claims, and therefore the ultimate liability of PG&E Corporation or the Utility for such claims may differ
from the amounts asserted in such claims. Allowed claims are paid in accordance with the Plan and the Confirmation Order. Amounts expected to be allowed
are reflected as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Holders of certain claims may assert that they are entitled under the Plan or the Bankruptcy Code to pursue, or continue to pursue, their claims against PG&E
Corporation and the Utility on or after the Emergence Date, including claims arising from or relating to indemnification or contribution claims, including with
respect to the wildfire that began on November 8, 2018 near the city of Paradise, Butte County, California (the “2018 Camp fire”), the 2017 Northern
California wildfires, and the wildfire that began September 9, 2015 in Amador and Calaveras counties in Northern California (the “2015 Butte fire”).
In addition, Subordinated Debt Claims and HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims (each as defined in Note 15 below) continue to be pursued against PG&E
Corporation and the Utility in the claims reconciliation process in the Bankruptcy Court, and claims against certain former directors and current and former
officers, as well as certain underwriters, are being pursued in the purported securities class action that is further described in Note 15 under the heading
“Securities Class Action Litigation.”
In addition to filing objections in the Bankruptcy Court to claims that were subject to certain defenses which allowed PG&E Corporation and the Utility to file
objections expunging those claims on an omnibus basis, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are working to resolve disputed claims, including Subordinated
Debt Claims and HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims. By order of the Bankruptcy Court, the current deadline for PG&E Corporation and the Utility to
object to claims is June 20, 2023.
NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Regulation and Regulated Operations
The Utility follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been
authorized by the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of providing service.  The Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized
revenue requirements through rates is generally independent, or “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility
records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility
capitalizes and records as regulatory assets costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered through
future rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are
currently being recovered through rates, the Utility records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  Amounts that are probable of being credited or
refunded to customers in the future are also recorded as regulatory liabilities.
The Utility also records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are
probable of recovery or refund.  In addition, the Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and
customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund.  These differences
have no impact on net income.  See “Revenue Recognition” below.
Management continues to believe the use of regulatory accounting is applicable and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable.  To
the extent that portions of the Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes
in regulation or other reasons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.
112
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are
stated at fair value. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility also holds $213 million of restricted cash that primarily consists of AB 1054 and SB 901 fixed
recovery charge collections that are to be used to service the associated bonds.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Utility recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered.  The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of
energy delivered to customers but not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  Rates charged to customers are based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. Revenues can vary significantly from period to period
because of seasonality, weather, and customer usage patterns.
Regulatory Balancing Account Revenue
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility’s revenues in the Utility’s GRCs, which occur every four years. CPUC and FERC rates decouple authorized revenue
from the volume of electricity and natural gas sales, so the Utility receives revenue equal to the amounts authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies. As a
result, the volume of electricity and natural gas sold does not have a direct impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results. The Utility
recognizes revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected
within 24 months.  Generally, electric and natural gas operating revenue is recognized ratably over the year. The Utility records a balancing account asset or
liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery or refund.
The Utility also collects additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers, including costs to
purchase electricity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.  In general, the revenue
recognition criteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. The Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset
or liability for differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences
are probable of recovery or refund. As a result, these differences have no impact on net income.
113
The following table presents the Utility’s revenues disaggregated by type of customer:
Year Ended December 31,

This activity is primarily related to the change in unbilled revenue and amounts subject to refund, partially offset by other miscellaneous revenue items.
These amounts represent revenues authorized to be billed or refunded to customers.
Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost – Credit Losses
PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the current expected credit loss model to estimate the expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets measured at
amortized cost. PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate credit risk in their portfolio of financial assets quarterly. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility identified the following significant categories of financial assets.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are represented by customer accounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record an allowance for doubtful accounts to recognize an estimate
of expected lifetime credit losses. The allowance is determined on a collective basis based on the historical amounts written-off and an assessment of customer
collectability. Furthermore, economic conditions are evaluated as part of the estimate of expected lifetime credit losses.
As of December 31, 2022, the Utility recorded a reduction to the allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $88 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as
a result of the approximately $200 million CAPP funding from the State of California, which was received in November 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the
Utility recorded a reduction to the allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $207 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of the expected
CAPP funding, which was received in January 2022.(1)

114
PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded expected credit losses of $143 million and $154 million in Operating and maintenance expense on the
Consolidated Statements of Income for credit losses associated with trade and other receivables during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The portion of expected
credit losses that are deemed probable of recovery are deferred to the RUBA, CPPMA, and a FERC regulatory asset. As of December 31, 2022, the RUBA
current balancing accounts receivable balance was $126 million, and CPPMA and FERC long-term regulatory asset balances were $3 million and $8 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the RUBA current balancing accounts receivable balance was $127 million, and CPPMA and FERC long-term
regulatory asset balances were $30 million and $12 million, respectively.
Other Receivables and Available-For-Sale Debt Securities
Insurance receivables are related to the liability insurance policies PG&E Corporation and the Utility carry. Insurance receivable risk is related to each
insurance carrier’s risk of defaulting on their individual policies. Wildfire Fund receivables are the funds available from the statewide fund established under
AB 1054 for payment of eligible claims related to the 2021 Dixie fire that exceed $1.0 billion and available insurance coverage. For more information, see
Note 15 below. Wildfire Fund receivables risk is related to the Wildfire Fund’s durability, which is a measurement of its claim-paying capacity. Lastly, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility are required to determine if the fair value is below the amortized cost basis for their available-for-sale debt securities (i.e.,
impairment). If such an impairment exists and does not otherwise result in a write-down, then PG&E Corporation and the Utility must determine whether a
portion of the impairment is a result of expected credit loss.
As of December 31, 2022, expected credit losses for insurance receivables, Wildfire Fund receivables, and available-for-sale debt securities were immaterial.
Emission Allowances
The Utility purchases GHG emission allowances to satisfy its compliance obligations. Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets
– other and other noncurrent assets – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.
Inventories
Inventories are carried at weighted-average cost and include gas stored underground, fuel oil, materials, and supplies.  Natural gas stored underground is
recorded to inventory when injected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribution to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation. 
Materials and supplies are recorded to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value.  Historical costs include labor and
materials, construction overhead, and AFUDC.  See “AFUDC” below.  The Utility’s estimated service lives of its property, plant, and equipment were as
follows:
 Estimated Service Balance at December 31,
(in millions, except estimated service lives) Lives (years) 2022 2021
Electricity generating facilities 5 to 75 $ 11,781 $ 11,217 
Electricity distribution facilities 10 to 70 41,061 37,723 
Electricity transmission facilities 15 to 75 16,413 15,516 
Natural gas distribution facilities 20 to 60 15,366 14,100 
Natural gas transmission and storage facilities 5 to 66 9,859 9,067 
Financing lease 18 18 
Construction work in progress 4,137 3,480 
General plant and other 5 to 50 8,518 7,838 
Total property, plant, and equipment 107,153 98,959 
Accumulated depreciation (30,946) (29,131)
Net property, plant, and equipment $ 76,207 $ 69,828 
Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories. Stored nuclear fuel inventory is stated at weighted-average cost. Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as it is used based on the amount of energy output.
See Note 16 below.(1)

(1) 
115
 Includes $1.8 billion of fire risk mitigation-related property, plant, and equipment securitized in accordance with AB 1054. See Note 5 below.
The Utility depreciates property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to
the gross investment balance in a particular class of property, with the exception of its securitized property, plant and equipment, which is depreciated over the
life of the bond and a pattern consistent with principal payments.  This method approximates the straight-line method of depreciation over the useful lives of
property, plant, and equipment.  The Utility’s composite depreciation rates were 3.74% in 2022, 3.82% in 2021, and 3.76% in 2020.  The useful lives of the
Utility’s property, plant, and equipment are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to
customers.  Depreciation expense includes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage
value at retirement.  Upon retirement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of
repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense
as incurred.
AFUDC
AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and is
capitalized as part of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placed in service. 
AFUDC related to the cost of debt is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.  The Utility
recorded AFUDC related to debt and equity, respectively, of $81 million and $184 million during 2022, $56 million and $133 million during 2021, and
$35 million and $140 million during 2020.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The following table summarizes the changes in ARO liability during 2022 and 2021, including nuclear decommissioning obligations:
(in millions) 2022 2021
ARO liability at beginning of year $ 5,298 $ 6,412 
Liabilities incurred 134 — 
Revision in estimated cash flows 325 (1,378)
Accretion 213 287 
Liabilities settled (58) (23)
ARO liability at end of year $ 5,912 $ 5,298 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair
value and its settlement date can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the related long-lived asset. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs
recovered through the ratemaking process. For more information, see Note 4 below.
The Utility has not recorded a liability related to certain AROs for assets that are expected to operate in perpetuity.  As the Utility cannot estimate a settlement
date or range of potential settlement dates for these assets, reasonable estimates of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for
retirement activities associated with substations, certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain communications
equipment from leased property; and restoration of land to the conditions under certain agreements.(2)
116
To estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,
escalation rates, credit-adjusted risk-free rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning. For generation facilities, the Utility uses a probability-weighted,
discounted cash flow model. For nuclear generation facilities, the model also considers multiple decommissioning start-year scenarios. The estimated future
cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk associated with the decommissioning obligation. The Utility performs
detailed studies of its nuclear generation facilities every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP, and updates its nuclear AROs accordingly, unless
circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios. The
decommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristics for the Utility’s nuclear power plants. Actual decommissioning costs
may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor,
materials, and equipment. The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs through rates through a non-bypassable charge that the
Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.
The total nuclear decommissioning obligation was $4.1 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, based on the cost study
performed as part of the 2021 NDCTP. The estimated probability-weighted, undiscounted decommissioning cash flows for the Utility’s nuclear power plants
was $7.1 billion and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility recorded an adjustment to the Diablo
Canyon ARO to reflect the potential extension of the decommissioning commencement by five years until 2030 as a result of SB 846 and the conditional award
from the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program. See “Senate Bill 846” and “U.S. DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program” below. The Utility’s ARO could be
materially impacted if the Utility does not receive the required federal and state licenses, permits, and approvals.
The ARO liability decreased from $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 to $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in the nuclear
decommissioning ARO of $1.3 billion. In December 2021, the Utility filed its 2021 NDCTP application, which includes a Diablo Canyon site-specific
decommissioning cost estimate of $4.0 billion. Relative to the 2018 NDCTP decision, the 2021 NDCTP application resulted in a decommissioning cost
estimate that was decreased by $378 million on a non-escalated basis and $2.6 billion on an escalated basis. The escalated basis assumed that costs will be
spread primarily over 56 years, which represents the assumption for how much time will be required for physical decommissioning of Units 1 and 2, and the
Diablo Canyon independent spent fuel storage installation. This decrease reflected favorable changes in the scope and methods of planned decommissioning
activities. Also as part of the 2021 NDCTP, the Utility filed modified escalation rates, in which the average total escalation factor decreased. Additionally, the
credit-adjusted risk-free rate was greater in 2021 than in 2020.
The increase of $614 million in the 2022 ARO liability at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to the update of the ARO
associated with the Diablo Canyon power plant as described above; the creation of a new liability for the permanently abandoned electric transmission lines in
connection with the Kincade SED Settlement (as defined in Note 15); increases in the probability that the Utility will be responsible for decommissioning
certain hydroelectric generation facilities; increases in the costs associated with retiring gas transmission pipelines; and increases in escalation factors. The
increase is offset by increases in the credit-adjusted risk-free rate from 2021 to 2022.
Disallowance of Plant Costs
PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not
be recoverable through rates charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts
The Utility’s nuclear generation facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires
the safe removal of a nuclear generation facility from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license
and release of the property for unrestricted use.  The Utility’s nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered through rates and are held in trusts until authorized
for release by the CPUC.
117
The Utility classifies its debt investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts as available-for-sale. Since the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust
assets are managed by external investment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized
losses are considered other-than-temporary impairments. Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable to or recoverable
from, respectively, customers through rates.  Therefore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO. 
There is no impact on the Utility’s earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined
by specific identification.
Government Assistance
PG&E Corporation and the Utility received various government assistance programs during the year ended December 31, 2022. PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s accounting policy is to apply a grant accounting model by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for Government Grants and
Disclosure of Government Assistance.
Assembly Bill 180
On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 180, which authorized the DWR to use up to $75 million to support contracts with the owners of
electric generating facilities pending retirement, such as Diablo Canyon, to fund, reimburse or compensate the owner for any costs, expenses or financial
commitments incurred to retain the future availability of such generating facilities pending further legislation. The resulting agreement between DWR and the
Utility was effective beginning October 1, 2022, and will continue until full disbursement of funds or termination per the agreement. In the event of a
termination, the Utility will take reasonable steps to end activities associated with this agreement and will return to DWR any unused funds. The Utility plans
to record the income related to government grants as a deduction to Operating and maintenance expense as eligible costs are incurred.
Senate Bill 846
On September 2, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030,
with the potential for an earlier retirement date. Additionally, the State of California has authorized a loan of up to $1.4 billion pursuant to SB 846 to the Utility
from the DWR to support the extension of plant operations. SB 846 further directs the Utility to take steps to secure funds from the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit
Program, and any other potentially available federal funding, to repay the loan. The loan may be forgiven under certain circumstances.
DWR Loan Agreement
On October 18, 2022, the DWR and the Utility executed a $1.4 billion loan agreement to support the extension of Diablo Canyon, up to approximately $1.1
billion of which could be repaid by funds received from the DOE (see “U.S. DOE's Civil Nuclear Credit Program” below). Under the loan agreement, the
DWR will pay the Utility a monthly performance-based disbursement equal to $7 for each MWh generated by Diablo Canyon, effective September 2, 2022.
The Utility may use the proceeds of the performance-based disbursements for any business purpose, but may not pay as shareholder profits or dividends or as
otherwise prohibited by SB 846. The Utility began earning performance-based disbursements beginning on September 2, 2022 and will no longer earn them on
the previously-approved retirement dates for Diablo Canyon Unit 1 and Unit 2 (2024 and 2025, respectively). The performance-based disbursements are
contingent upon the Utility’s ongoing pursuit of extension of the operating period and continued safe and reliable Diablo Canyon operations. The aggregate
amount of performance-based disbursements under this agreement will not exceed $300 million.
The Utility initially accounts for all disbursements from the DWR loan agreement pursuant to ASC 470, Debt. When there is reasonable assurance that the
Utility will have loan disbursements forgiven by the DWR, such as when the Utility earns a performance-based disbursement, the Utility will recognize those
forgiven loans as income related to government grants. The Utility plans to record the income related to government grants as a deduction to Operating and
maintenance expense in the same period(s) that eligible costs are incurred. As of December 31, 2022, the consolidated financial statements reflected
$312 million in Long-term debt, and a deduction of $38 million to Operating and maintenance expense for income related to government grants for
performance-based disbursements.
118
U.S. DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program
On November 17, 2022, the Utility was conditionally awarded a total of approximately $1.1 billion from the DOE related to Diablo Canyon (See “DWR Loan
Agreement” above). Final award amounts will be determined following completion of each year of the award period, and amounts awarded over a four-year
award period ending in 2026 will be based on actual costs. The Utility will repay its loans outstanding under the DWR Loan Agreement with funding received
from the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program. When there is reasonable assurance that the Utility will receive funding and comply with the conditions of the
DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program, the Utility will recognize such funding as income related to government grants. The Utility plans to record the income
related to government grants as a deduction to Operating and maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income as eligible costs are incurred.
Variable Interest Entities
A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or
whose equity investors lack any characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary
beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.  
Consolidated VIEs
Receivables Securitization Program
The SPV was created in connection with the Receivables Securitization Program and is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the
Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Pursuant to the Receivables Securitization Program, the Utility sells
certain of its receivables and certain related rights to payment and obligations of the Utility with respect to such receivables, and certain other related rights to
the SPV, which, in turn, obtains loans secured by the receivables from financial institutions (the “Lenders”). The pledged receivables and the corresponding
debt are included in Accounts receivable, Accrued unbilled revenue, Other noncurrent assets, and Long-term debt, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
The SPV is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its activities. The most significant activities that impact the economic
performance of the SPV are decisions made to manage receivables. The Utility is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates the SPV as it makes
these decisions. No additional financial support was provided to the SPV during 2022 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not previously
contractually required. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the SPV had net accounts receivable of $3.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, and outstanding
borrowings of $1.2 billion and $974 million, respectively, under the Receivables Securitization Program. For more information, see Note 5 below.
AB 1054 Securitization
PG&E Recovery Funding LLC is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of
PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Pursuant to the financing order for the first AB 1054 securitization transaction, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues
from the non-bypassable wildfire hardening fixed recovery charge (“Recovery Property”) to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued recovery
bonds secured by the Recovery Property.
PG&E Recovery Funding LLC is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. The most significant activities that
impact the economic performance of PG&E Recovery Funding LLC are decisions made by the servicer of the Recovery Property. The Utility is considered the
primary beneficiary and consolidates PG&E Recovery Funding LLC as it acts in this role as servicer. No additional financial support was provided to PG&E
Recovery Funding LLC during 2022 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not previously contractually required. On November 12, 2021, PG&E
Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $860 million of senior secured recovery bonds. On November 30, 2022, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued
approximately $983 million of Series 2022-A Senior Secured Recovery Bonds. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding
LLC had outstanding borrowings of $1.8 billion and $860 million, respectively, included in Long-term debt and Long-term debt, classified as current on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information, see Note 5 below.

SB 901 Securitization
PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to
creditors of PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Pursuant to the financing order for the SB 901 securitization transaction, the Utility sold its right to receive
revenues from the non-bypassable fixed recovery charge (“SB 901 Recovery Property”) to PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued
recovery bonds secured by the SB 901 Recovery Property.
PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. The most significant
activities that impact the economic performance of PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC are decisions made by the servicer of the SB 901 Recovery
Property. The Utility is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC as it acts in this role as servicer. No
additional financial support was provided to PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC during 2022 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not
previously contractually required. On May 10, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured
recovery bonds (the “Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds”). On July 20, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.9 billion aggregate principal
amount of senior secured recovery bonds (the “Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds”). As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC had
outstanding borrowings of $7.5 billion included in Long-term debt and Long-term debt, classified as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more
information, see Note 6 below.
Non-Consolidated VIEs
Some of the counterparties to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that would
generate electricity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs as of December 31, 2022, it
assessed whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power
purchase agreement, analyzed the variability in the VIE’s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities
that are most significant to the VIE’s performance, such as dispatch rights or operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited
to the amount the Utility pays for delivered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities
that are most significant to the economic performance of any of these VIEs.  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs as of
December 31, 2022, it did not consolidate any of them.
Contributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054
PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for contributions to the Wildfire Fund by capitalizing an asset, amortizing to periods ratably based on an estimated
period of coverage, and incrementally adjusting for accelerated amortization as the level of coverage declines, as further described below. However, AB 1054
did not specify a period of coverage for the Wildfire Fund; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates.
Since the inception of the Wildfire Fund, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have estimated a period of coverage of 15 years. In estimating the period of
coverage, PG&E Corporation and the Utility used a dataset of historical, publicly available fire-loss data caused by electrical equipment to create Monte Carlo
simulations of expected loss. The number of years of historic fire-loss data and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts by the California electric utility
companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the period of coverage. Other assumptions include the estimated costs to settle wildfire claims for
participating electric utilities including the Utility, the CPUC’s determinations of whether costs were just and reasonable in cases of electric utility-caused
wildfires and amounts required to be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, the impacts of climate change, the amount of future insurance coverage held by the
electric utilities, the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of participating electric
utilities. These assumptions create a high degree of uncertainty for the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate and, where appropriate, update all assumptions quarterly. Changes in any of the assumptions could materially
impact the estimated period of coverage. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess the Wildfire Fund asset for acceleration of the amortization of the asset in
the event that it is probable that a participating utility’s electrical equipment will be found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophic wildfire. During the year
ended December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility updated assumptions related to the mitigation effectiveness and historical fire loss dataset to
align with the risk modeling within the 2022 WMP. These updates did not change the estimated period of coverage, which continues to be 15 years from the
inception of the Wildfire Fund.
120
As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $935 million in Other non-current liabilities,
$460 million in Current assets - Wildfire Fund asset, and $4.8 billion in Non-current assets - Wildfire Fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During
the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $477 million and $517 million, respectively. The
amortization of the asset, accretion of the liability, and applicable acceleration of the amortization of the asset is reflected in Wildfire Fund expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had recorded $175 million in Other noncurrent assets for
Wildfire Fund receivables related to the 2021 Dixie fire.
For more information, see “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 15 below.
Other Accounting Policies
For other accounting policies impacting PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements, see “Income Taxes” in Note 10,
“Derivatives” in Note 11, “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 12, and “Contingencies and Commitments” in Notes 15 and 16 below.
Voluntary Separation Program
In the second quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility enacted a VSP, which provides separation benefits to approximately 470 eligible employees
who voluntarily agreed to terminate their employment under the program. The VSP includes certain one-time cash payments and a credit to the employee’s
retirement health savings account. PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for the VSP as a special termination benefit with any costs of the special
separation benefits recorded upon each employee’s irrevocable acceptance. During the year ended December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility
recorded $80 million in Operating and maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to one-time cash payments in connection with
the VSP. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, VSP-related credits to employee retirement health savings accounts totaled $22 million. This
amount will be paid using the PG&E Corporation and Utility postretirement medical plan trusts’ assets and does not impact income.

Recognition of Lease Assets and Liabilities
A lease exists when an arrangement allows the lessee to control the use of an identified asset for a stated period in exchange for payments. This determination
is made at inception of the arrangement. All leases must be recognized as a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet of the lessee. The ROU asset
reflects the lessee’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and the lease liability reflects the obligation to make the lease payments. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components.
The Utility estimates the ROU assets and lease liabilities at net present value using its incremental secured borrowing rates unless the implicit discount rate in
the leasing arrangement can be ascertained. The incremental secured borrowing rate is based on observed market data and other information available at the
lease commencement date. The ROU assets and lease liabilities only include the fixed lease payments for arrangements with terms greater than 12 months.
These amounts are presented within the supplemental disclosures of noncash activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Renewal and termination
options only impact the lease term if it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. PG&E Corporation recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. The Utility recognizes lease expense in conformity with ratemaking.
Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Financing leases are included in property, plant, and equipment, other current liabilities, and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Financing leases were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility made total cash payments, including fixed and variable, of $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion,
respectively, for operating leases which are presented within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The fixed cash payments for the
principal portion of the financing lease liabilities are immaterial and continue to be included within financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows. Any variable lease payments for financing leases are included in operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The majority of the Utility’s ROU assets and lease liabilities relate to various power purchase agreements and the Oakland lease. These power purchase
agreements primarily consist of generation plants leased to meet customer demand plus applicable reserve margins. Operating lease variable costs include
amounts from renewable energy power purchase agreements where payments are based on certain contingent external factors such as wind, hydro, solar,
biogas, and biomass power generation. See “Third-Party Power Purchase Agreements” in Note 16 below. (1)

122
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded ROU assets and lease liabilities related to property and land arrangements. Property arrangements
primarily consist of an office lease agreement for the Lakeside Building. On October 23, 2020, the Utility and BA2 300 Lakeside LLC (“Landlord”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of TMG Bay Area Investments II, LLC, entered into an office lease agreement for approximately 910,000 rentable square feet of space
within the Lakeside Building to serve as the Utility’s principal administrative headquarters (the “Lease”). In connection with the Lease, the Utility also issued
to Landlord (i) an option payment letter of credit in the amount of $75 million, and (ii) a lease security letter of credit in the amount of $75 million.
The term of the Lease began on April 8, 2022. The Lease term will expire 34 years and 11 months after the commencement date, unless earlier terminated in
accordance with the terms of the Lease. In addition to base rent, the Utility will be responsible for certain costs and charges specified in the Lease, including
insurance costs, maintenance costs and taxes.
The Lease requires the Landlord to pursue approvals to subdivide the real estate it owns surrounding the Lakeside Building to create a separate legal parcel that
contains the Lakeside Building (the “Property”) that can be sold to the Utility. The Lease grants to the Utility an option to purchase the Property, following
such subdivision, at a price of $892 million, subject to certain adjustments (the “Purchase Price”). On February 6, 2023, the process of subdividing the real
estate was completed. If the option is exercised pursuant to the terms of the existing agreement then the Purchase Price would be paid in or around July 2023.
The Lease also requires the rentable space to be delivered in two phases, with each phase consisting of multiple subphases. As of December 31, 2022,
approximately 488,000 rentable square feet of the leased premises has been made available for use by the Utility. The Utility has recorded approximately
$535 million in Operating lease right of use assets, approximately $214 million of leasehold improvements, which includes approximately $137 million that
was provided to the Utility as lease incentives, and approximately $672 million in noncurrent Operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Financial
Statements related to the Lease.
In January 2023, approximately 110,000 of additional rentable square feet was made available for use by the Utility.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility’s operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 19.6 years and 6.04 years and a weighted
average discount rate of 6.5% and 6.1%, respectively.
The following table shows the lease expense recognized for the fixed and variable component of the Utility’s lease obligations:
Year Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021
Operating lease fixed cost $ 500 $ 578 
Operating lease variable cost 1,829 1,782

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
Debt
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an
Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible
instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted this ASU on January 1, 2022. There was no material impact on
PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the related disclosures resulting from the adoption of this ASU.
Reference Rate Reform
On April 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference
Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and elected the optional amendments for contract modifications prospectively. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022
to December 31, 2024. PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted this ASU in December 2022 and will apply the guidance through December 31, 2024. There
was no material impact on PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the related disclosures resulting from the adoption of
this ASU.

In connection with the settlement agreement entered into among PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC in 2003 to resolve the Utility’s 2001 proceeding under Chapter 11, the CPUC
authorized the Utility to recover $1.2 billion of costs related to the Utility’s retained generation assets.  The individual components of these regulatory assets are being amortized over the respective
lives of the underlying generation facilities, consistent with the period over which the related revenues are recognized. 
Includes costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergency by competent federal or state authorities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $44 million
and $49 million in COVID-19 related costs were recorded to CEMA regulatory assets, respectively. Recovery of CEMA costs is subject to CPUC review and approval.
Represents incremental wildfire claims and outside legal expenses related to the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire. Recovery of WEMA costs is subject to CPUC review and approval.
Includes costs associated with the implementation of regulations and requirements adopted to protect the public from potential fire hazards associated with overhead power line facilities and nearby
aerial communication facilities that have not been previously authorized in another proceeding. Recovery of FHPMA costs is subject to CPUC review and approval.
Includes costs primarily associated with the 2019 WMP for the period January 1, 2019 through June 4, 2019 and other incremental costs associated with fire risk mitigation. Recovery of FRMMA
costs is subject to CPUC review and approval.
 Includes costs associated with the 2019 WMP for the period June 5, 2019 through December 31, 2019, the 2020 WMP for the period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the 2021 WMP
for the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and the 2022 WMP for the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. Recovery of WMPMA costs is subject to CPUC
review and approval.
 Represents cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense recognized in accordance with GAAP.
Represents excess liability insurance premium costs recorded to RTBA and adjustment mechanism for costs determined in other proceedings, as authorized in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S rate
cases, respectively.
Includes costs associated with certain wildfire mitigation activities for the period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Noncurrent balance represents costs above 115% of adopted revenue
requirements, which are subject to CPUC review and approval.
Represents vegetation management costs above 120% of adopted revenue requirements, which are subject to CPUC review and approval.
Includes costs associated with customer protections, including higher uncollectible costs related to the moratorium on electric and gas service disconnections program implementation costs, and
higher accounts receivable financing costs for the period of March 4, 2020 to September 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility had recorded uncollectibles in the amount of $4 million for
small business customers. The remaining $22 million is associated with program costs and higher accounts receivable financing costs. As of December 31, 2021, the Utility had recorded
uncollectibles in the amount of $30 million for residential customers pending approval for recovery in the RUBA in addition to uncollectibles recorded for small business customers. The remaining
$19 million is associated with program costs and higher accounts receivable financing costs. Recovery of CPPMA costs is subject to CPUC review and approval.
Includes costs associated with temporary generation, infrastructure upgrades, and community grid enablement programs associated with the implementation of microgrids. Amounts incurred are
subject to CPUC review and approval.
 Includes costs associated with long-term debt financing deemed recoverable under ASC 980 more than twelve months from the current date. These costs and their amortization period are
reviewable and approved in the Utility’s cost of capital or other regulatory filings. Recovery periods vary because the balance consists of financing costs associated with debts that have different
amortization periods depending on their maturity date.
 In connection with the SB 901 securitization, the CPUC authorized the issuance of one or more series of recovery bonds in connection with the post-emergence transaction to finance $7.5 billion of
claims associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The balance represents PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC’s right to recover $7.5 billion in wildfire claims costs associated with
the 2017 Northern California wildfires, partially offset by the $2.0 billion in required upfront shareholder contributions to the customer credit trust, net of amortization since inception. The recovery
bonds will be paid through fixed recovery charges, which are designed to recover the full scheduled principal amount of the recovery bonds along with any associated interest and financing costs.
See Note 6 below.
Represents the cumulative differences between ARO expenses and amounts collected in rates.  Decommissioning costs related to the Utility’s nuclear facilities are recovered through rates and are
placed in nuclear decommissioning trusts.  This regulatory asset also represents the deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses on these nuclear decommissioning trust investments.  See
Note 12 below. Recovery periods for this balance vary because the different sites and assets to which the ARO expenses are attributable have different recovery periods.
In general, regulatory assets represent the cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense or accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) recognized in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, the Utility does not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do
not accrue interest. Accordingly, the Utility earns a return on its regulatory assets for retained generation, and regulatory assets for unamortized loss, net of
gain, on reacquired debt.
Regulatory Liabilities
Current Regulatory Liabilities
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility had current regulatory liabilities of $1.12 billion and $698 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, current
regulatory liabilities consisted primarily of unrealized gains associated with the change in fair value of price risk management instruments that meet the
definition of a derivative. An increase in natural gas prices has affected both the Utility’s gas and electric price risk management instruments, resulting in a
deferral of $604 million. For more information, see Note 11 below. Current regulatory liabilities are included within current liabilities-other in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.(2)

Total long-term regulatory liabilities $ 17,630 $ 11,999 
Represents the cumulative differences between the recorded costs to remove assets and amounts collected in rates for expected costs to remove assets.
Represents the cumulative differences between ARO expenses and amounts collected in rates.  Decommissioning costs related to the Utility’s nuclear facilities are recovered through rates and are
held in nuclear decommissioning trusts.  This regulatory liability also represents the deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses on these nuclear decommissioning trust investments.  See
Note 12 below.
 Represents amounts received from customers designated for public purpose program costs expected to be incurred beyond the next 12 months, primarily related to energy efficiency programs.
 Represents cumulative differences between incurred costs and amounts collected in rates for post-retirement medical, post-retirement life and long-term disability plans.
 Represents the portion of the net proceeds received from the sale of transmission tower wireless licenses that will be returned to customers. Of the $430 million, $300 million will be refunded to
FERC-jurisdictional customers, and $130 million will be refunded to CPUC-jurisdictional customers.
 Represents the noncurrent portion of the net gain on the sale of the SFGO, which closed on September 17, 2021, that will be distributed to customers over a five-year period that began in 2022.
In connection with the SB 901 securitization, the Utility is required to return up to $7.59 billion of certain shareholder tax benefits to customers via periodic bill credits over the life of the recovery
bonds. The balance reflects qualifying shareholder tax benefits that PG&E Corporation is obligated to contribute to the customer credit trust, net of amortization since inception, and is expected to
increase as additional qualifying amounts are recognized, including when the Fire Victim Trust sells additional shares. PG&E Corporation will continue to separately recognize tax benefits within
income tax expense on the income statement. See Note 6 below.
Regulatory Balancing Accounts
The Utility tracks (1) differences between the Utility’s authorized revenue requirement and customer billings, and (2) differences between incurred costs and
customer billings.  To the extent these differences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months, the Utility records a current regulatory balancing
account receivable or payable.  Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a period exceeding 12 months are recorded as
other noncurrent assets – regulatory assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences
do not have an impact on net income.  Balancing accounts fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs are
incurred and customer revenues are collected. (1)

AB 1054
AB 1054 provides that certain capital expenditures may be financed using a structure that securitizes a dedicated customer charge. On March 11, 2022, the
Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a second transaction to securitize up to $1.7 billion of fire risk mitigation capital
expenditure amounts that have been or would be incurred by the Utility from 2019 through 2022. The $1.7 billion reflected $212 million recorded and
$1.16 billion forecasted capital expenditure amounts that were approved by the CPUC in the 2020 GRC and up to $350 million capital expenditure amounts
pending in the 2020 WMCE proceeding. On May 4, 2022, the $350 million of capital expenditure amounts were removed because the CPUC extended the
schedule in the 2020 WMCE proceeding such that a final decision approving such capital expenditure amounts in that proceeding was no longer expected prior
to the issuance of a financing order authorizing the second AB 1054 securitization transaction.  The final amount to be securitized would be based on actual
recorded capital expenditures incurred by the Utility prior to the securitization transaction.
129
On August 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the securitization of up to approximately $1.4 billion of fire risk mitigation capital
expenditures, which was the amount requested in the application less the $350 million pending in the 2020 WMCE proceeding. The Utility securitized
$975 million of these expenditures in 2022 and plans to securitize remaining expenditures in subsequent periods. On November 30, 2022, PG&E Recovery
Funding LLC issued approximately $983 million of Series 2022-A Senior Secured Recovery Bonds. The senior secured recovery bonds were issued in three
tranches: (1) approximately $215 million with an interest rate of 5.045% due July 15, 2034, (2) approximately $200 million with an interest rate of 5.256% due
January 15, 2040, and (3) approximately $568 million with an interest rate of 5.536% due July 15, 2049. The payment dates for the Series 2022-A Senior
Secured Recovery Bonds are January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2023 and continuing until the final maturity date. PG&E Recovery
Funding LLC and the Utility entered into certain agreements in connection with the issuance of the Series 2022-A Senior Secured Recovery Bonds, including
(1) the Recovery Property Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2022 (“the Sale Agreement”), (2) the Recovery Property Servicing
Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2022 (the “Servicing Agreement”), and the Administration Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2022 (the
“Administration Agreement”).
Pursuant to the agreements described above, the Utility sells rights and interests in the Recovery Property (as defined in the Amended Articles) created pursuant
to the Wildfire Financing Law and the Financing Order (as defined in the Amended Articles) to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC; the Utility carries out the
functions pursuant to the Servicing Agreement to determine the Fixed Recovery Charges (as defined in the Amended Articles); and the Utility provides
corporate management services to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Utility used the proceeds of the sale of the
Recovery Property in accordance with the Wildfire Financing Law and the Financing Order.

NOTE 6: SB 901 SECURITIZATION AND CUSTOMER CREDIT TRUST
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so
that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and
safe service. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as
“securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in
excess of the CHT.
Pursuant to SB 901, on April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to finance, using
securitization, $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs and create a corresponding customer credit trust that is designed to not impact the net amounts billed to
customers. The proceeds of the securitization were used to repay certain debt that the Utility had initially issued for the payment of wildfire claims costs
associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. On April 23, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision finding that $7.5 billion of the Utility’s 2017
catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs that may be financed through the issuance of recovery bonds pursuant to Public Utilities Code
sections 850 et seq. (“CHT Decision”). As requested, the decision authorized the Utility to establish a customer credit trust funded by PG&E Corporation’s
shareholders that will provide a monthly credit to customers that is anticipated to equal the fixed recovery charges such that the securitization is designed to be
rate neutral to customers. The decision adopts a transaction structure comprised of four elements: (1) an initial shareholder contribution to the customer credit
trust of $2.0 billion, $1.0 billion of which was contributed in 2022 and $1.0 billion to be contributed in 2024; (2) up to $7.59 billion of additional contributions
funded by certain shareholder tax benefits; (3) a single CPUC review of the balance of the customer credit trust in 2040, with a single contingent supplemental
shareholder contribution, if needed, up to $775 million in 2040; and (4) sharing with customers 25% of any surplus of shareholder assets in the customer credit
trust at the end of the life of the trust.(7)

On May 11, 2021, the CPUC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of one or more series of recovery bonds in connection with the post-emergence
transaction to finance, using securitization, the $7.5 billion of claims associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. On February 28, 2022, the
decision finding $7.5 billion of stress test costs eligible for securitization and the financing order authorizing the issuance of up to $7.5 billion of recovery
bonds became final and non-appealable.
On May 10, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued the Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds. The Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds were issued in five
tranches:
Tranche Amount Interest Rate Final Maturity Date

A-5 $ 900,000,000 4.674 % December 1, 2053
The net proceeds were used to fund the redemption of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due June
16, 2022 on May 16, 2022 and the redemption of all $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s 1.75% First Mortgage Bonds due June 16, 2022 on

outstanding under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. The payment dates for the Series 2022-A Recovery
Bonds are June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2022 and continuing until the final maturity date.
On May 9, 2022, the Utility contributed $480 million to the customer credit trust. On July 19, 2022, the Utility contributed $520 million to the customer credit
trust in full satisfaction of the first $1.0 billion as required by the CHT decision.

The net proceeds were used to fund (1) the redemption of all $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s 1.367% First Mortgage Bonds due March
10, 2023 on July 25, 2022, (2) the prepayment of all $500 million of loans outstanding under the 2022A Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement, and (3) the
repayment of a portion of loans outstanding under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. The Utility also
intends to use a portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the redemption of all $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Utility’s 3.25% First Mortgage
Bonds due 2024. The payment dates for the Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds are June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2023 and
continuing until the final maturity date.
Pursuant to the financing order, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues from the non-bypassable fixed recovery charge (“SB 901 Recovery Property”) to
PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued the recovery bonds secured by the SB 901 Recovery Property. The fixed recovery charge is
designed to recover the full scheduled principal amount of the recovery bonds along with any associated interest and financing costs. In the context of the CHT
decision, which is intended to insulate customers from the fixed recovery charge, there is a customer credit which is designed to equal the recovery bond
principal, interest, and financing costs over the life of the recovery bonds. The customer credit is funded by the customer credit trust (see Note 12). The fixed
recovery charges and customer credits are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income and had no net impact on
Operating Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.
133
Also pursuant to the CHT decision, upon issuance of the Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds in May 2022 (“inception”), the Utility recorded a $5.5 billion SB 901
securitization regulatory asset reflecting PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC’s right to recover $7.5 billion in wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017
Northern California wildfires, previously recognized within wildfire-related claims expense, partially offset by the $2.0 billion in required upfront shareholder
contributions to the customer credit trust. The Utility also recorded a $5.54 billion SB 901 securitization regulatory liability at inception, which represents
certain shareholder tax benefits the Utility had previously recognized that will be returned to customers. As the Fire Victim Trust sells the remaining shares it
holds of PG&E Corporation common stock, the SB 901 securitization regulatory liability will increase, reflecting the recognition of additional income tax
benefits, up to $7.59 billion as required in the CHT decision. As these tax benefits are monetized, they will be contributed to the customer credit trust. The
Utility expects to amortize the SB 901 securitization regulatory asset and liability over the life of the recovery bonds, with such amortization reflected in
Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Utility recorded SB 901
securitization charges, net, of $608 million for inception of the regulatory asset and liability pursuant to the CHT decision discussed above, as well as tax
benefits realized within income tax expense in the current year related to the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock (See Note 7 below)
and amortization of the regulatory asset and liability in the Consolidated Statements of Income. SB 901 securitization charges are expected to increase in future
periods, up to $2.09 billion, as the aforementioned tax benefits are recognized and recorded within deferred income taxes.
The following tables illustrate the inception to date SB 901 securitization impact on the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities:

NOTE 7: COMMON STOCK AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
PG&E Corporation had 1,987,784,948 shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2022, which excludes 247,743,590 shares of common stock
owned by ShareCo, and 230,000,000 shares of common stock owned by the Utility. PG&E Corporation held all of the Utility’s outstanding common stock at
December 31, 2022.
Equity Offerings
During 2020, PG&E Corporation issued approximately 16 million PG&E Corporation equity units. The equity units represent the right of the unitholders to
receive, on the settlement date, between 138 million and 168 million shares of PG&E Corporation common stock. The common stock received will be based on
the value of PG&E Corporation common stock over a measurement period specified in the equity units purchase contracts and subject to certain adjustments as
provided therein. The settlement date of the equity unit purchase contracts is August 16, 2023, subject to acceleration or postponement as provided in the
purchase contracts.
134
At the Market Equity Distribution Program
On April 30, 2021, PG&E Corporation entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (“Equity Distribution Agreement”) with Barclays Capital Inc., BofA
Securities, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents and as forward sellers (in such capacities as applicable,
the “Agents” and the “Forward Sellers,” respectively), and Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A., Credit Suisse Capital LLC and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as forward purchasers (the “Forward Purchasers”), establishing an at the market equity distribution program, pursuant to which PG&E
Corporation, through the Agents, may offer and sell from time to time shares of PG&E Corporation’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of
up to $400 million. PG&E Corporation has no obligation to offer or sell any of its common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time
suspend offers under the Equity Distribution Agreement.
The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that, in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of common stock by PG&E Corporation to or through the
Agents, PG&E Corporation may enter into forward sale agreements (collectively, the “Forward Sale Agreements”) pursuant to which the relevant Forward
Purchaser will borrow shares from third parties and, through its affiliated Forward Seller, offer a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of
shares of common stock underlying the particular Forward Sale Agreement.
On October 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation suspended the At the Market Equity Distribution Program until further notice. As of the suspension date, PG&E
Corporation had not sold any shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement.
Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles
Under Section 382 of the IRC, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwards and other tax
attributes may be subject to certain limitations (which could limit PG&E Corporation or the Utility’s ability to use these DTAs to offset taxable income). In
general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-
through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three
years). The Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) that increase a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons)
ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to 4.75% or more prior to the Restriction Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without
approval by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation.
On July 8, 2021, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant to
which PG&E Corporation and the Utility made a “grantor trust” election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim
Trust. As a result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and,
in turn attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust, along with any shares owned by the
Utility directly, are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s Percentage Stock Ownership (as
defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the 4.75% ownership limitation in the Amended Articles. Shares owned by ShareCo are also effectively
excluded because ShareCo is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes. For example, although PG&E Corporation had 2,466,208,388 shares outstanding as
of February 16, 2023, only 1,800,721,208 shares (that is, the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of shares held by the Fire Victim
Trust, the Utility and ShareCo) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles. As such, based on the total number of
outstanding equity securities and taking into account the shares of PG&E Corporation common stock known to have been sold by the Fire Victim Trust as of
February 16, 2023, a person’s effective Percentage Stock Ownership limitation for purposes of the Amended Articles as of February 16, 2023 was 3.46% of the
outstanding shares. At various dates throughout 2022, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged Plan Shares for an equal number of New Shares in the manner
contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement; in each case, the Fire Victim Trust thereafter reported that it sold the applicable New Shares.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock in the aggregate amount of 230,000,000 shares
resulted in an aggregate tax benefit of $870 million recorded in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements. As of February 16,
2023, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fire Victim Trust had sold 290,000,000 shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in the aggregate.
As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and consequently, its net operating loss
carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC.
135
Dividends
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31,
2018.
On June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility reinstated the dividend on the Utility’s common stock and declared a common stock dividend of
$425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on June 17, 2022. On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock
dividend of $425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on September 16, 2022. On December 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a
common stock dividend of $425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on December 20, 2022. No dividend is payable until declared by the Board of
Directors of the Utility.
In addition, the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement requires that PG&E Corporation (1) maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated
capitalization of no greater than 70% as of the end of each fiscal quarter and (2) if revolving loans are outstanding as of the end of a fiscal quarter, a ratio of
adjusted cash to fixed charges, as of the end of such fiscal quarter, of at least 150% prior to the date that PG&E Corporation first declares a cash dividend on its
common stock and at least 100% thereafter.
Under the Utility’s Articles of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferred
stock have been paid.  Additionally, the CPUC requires the Utility to maintain a capital structure composed of at least 52% equity on average. On May 28,
2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among other things, grants the Utility a temporary, five-year waiver from
compliance with its authorized capital structure for the financing in place upon the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.  
Subject to the foregoing restrictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Boards of Directors and will
depend on, among other things, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Boards of
Directors may deem relevant. Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, PG&E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes
$6.2 billion in Non-GAAP Core Earnings following the Emergence Date. “Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core
items as described in the Plan. PG&E Corporation is unable to predict when it will commence the payment of dividends on its common stock.
Long-Term Incentive Plans
The LTIP (i.e., the PG&E Corporation 2014 LTIP or the PG&E Corporation 2021 LTIP, as applicable) permits various forms of share-based incentive awards,
including stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other share-based awards, to eligible employees of PG&E Corporation and its
subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to receive certain share-based awards.  A maximum of 91 million shares of PG&E
Corporation common stock (subject to certain adjustments) has been reserved for issuance under the LTIP, of which 53,350,101 shares were available for future
awards at December 31, 2022.
The following table provides a summary of total share-based compensation expense recognized by PG&E Corporation for share-based incentive awards for
2022:

Total compensation expense (pre-tax) $ 115 $ 56 $ 35 
Total compensation expense (after-tax) $ 83 $ 40 $ 25 
Share-based compensation costs are generally not capitalized.  There was no material difference between PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the information
disclosed above.
136
Stock Options
The exercise price of stock options granted under the LTIP and all other outstanding stock options is equal to the market price of PG&E Corporation’s common
stock on the date of grant.  Stock options generally have a 10-year term and vest over three years of continuous service, subject to accelerated vesting in certain
circumstances. As of December 31, 2022, there were no unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options for PG&E Corporation.
The fair value of each stock option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method. No stock options were granted in 2022 or
2021.  
Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of PG&E Corporation’s common stock.  The expected dividend payment is the dividend yield at the date
of grant.  The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the date of
grant.  The expected life of stock options is derived from historical data that estimates stock option exercises and employee departure behavior.
There was no tax benefit recognized from stock options for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units generally vest equally over three years. Vested restricted stock units are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock
accompanied by cash payments to settle any dividend equivalents associated with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generally
recognized ratably over the vesting period based on grant-date fair value.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units granted during
2022, 2021, and 2020 was $11.40, $11.01, and $9.25, respectively.  The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was
$46 million, $19 million, and $31 million, respectively.  The tax detriment from restricted stock units that vested in 2022 was $4 million.  In general, forfeitures
are recorded ratably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2022, $74 million of
total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of
1.48 years.

137
Performance Shares
Performance shares generally vest three years after the grant date.  Following vesting, performance shares are settled in shares of common stock based on either
PG&E Corporation’s total shareholder return relative to a specified group of industry peer companies over a three-year performance period (“TSR”) or an
internal PG&E Corporation metric (subject in some instances to a multiplier based on TSR).  Dividend equivalents, if any, are paid in cash based on the amount
of common stock to which the recipients are entitled. 
Compensation expense attributable to performance shares is generally recognized ratably over the applicable three-year period based on the grant-date fair
value determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model for the TSR-based awards or the grant-date market value of PG&E Corporation common
stock for internal metric based awards.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for performance shares granted during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $13.44,
$11.83, and $9.62 respectively.  In general, forfeitures are recorded ratably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when
vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2022, $43 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance shares was expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 0.94 years.

NOTE 8: PREFERRED STOCK
PG&E Corporation has authorized 400 million shares of preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.
The Utility has authorized 75 million shares of first preferred stock, with a par value of $25 per share, and 10 million shares of $100 first preferred stock, with a
par value of $100 per share.  At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility’s preferred stock outstanding included $145 million of shares with interest rates
between 5% and 6% designated as nonredeemable preferred stock and $113 million of shares with interest rates between 4.36% and 5% that are redeemable
between $25.75 and $27.25 per share, respectively.  The Utility’s preferred stock outstanding are not subject to mandatory redemption. No shares of $100 first
preferred stock are outstanding.
On December 31, 2022, annual dividends on the Utility’s nonredeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.25 to $1.50 per share.  The Utility’s redeemable
preferred stock is subject to redemption at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and
unpaid dividends through the redemption date.  At December 31, 2022, annual dividends on redeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.09 to $1.25 per share.
Dividends on all Utility preferred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation
rights.  Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and
unpaid dividends, as specified for the class and series.  On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and
unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock as of January 31, 2022 totaling $59.1 million, which was paid on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April
29, 2022. In addition to the dividends paid in arrears, the Utility paid approximately $11 million of dividends on redeemable preferred stock during the year
ended December 31, 2022. On December 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock totaling
$3.5 million, which was paid on February 15, 2023, to holders of record on January 31, 2023.
The Utility paid no dividends on preferred stock in 2021 or 2020.
138
NOTE 9: EARNINGS PER SHARE
PG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calculated by dividing the income (loss) available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding.  PG&E Corporation applies the treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the
calculation of diluted EPS.  The following is a reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s income (loss) available for common shareholders and weighted average
common shares outstanding for calculating diluted EPS for 2022, 2021, and 2020.

For each of the periods presented above, the calculation of outstanding common shares on a diluted basis excluded an insignificant amount of options and
securities that were antidilutive.
NOTE 10: INCOME TAXES
PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The income tax provision includes current and deferred
income taxes resulting from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating DTAs
and liabilities.  DTAs and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciation expense.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is
measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, the difference between a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in future periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial
statements represents an unrecognized tax benefit. 
Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investment
recovery period.  The Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.
PG&E Corporation files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or
more.  PG&E Corporation files a combined state income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement
under which the Utility determines its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis.

 Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize the deferred tax
impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and
reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future
rates.  In 2022, 2021, and 2020, the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax Act passed in December
2017.
The Utility includes an adjustment for the tax benefit of the sale of shares by the Fire Victim Trust in 2022, a DTA write-off associated with the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust in
2021 and an adjustment for the DTA write-off for difference between the liability recorded related to the Restructuring Support Agreement dated December 6, 2019 with the Official Committee of
Tort Claimants and attorneys and other advisors and agents for certain holders of Fire Victim Claims (as defined therein), as amended and the ultimate value of PG&E Corporation stock contributed
to the Fire Victim Trust in 2020. PG&E Corporation includes the same adjustment as the Utility in these years as well as a permanent non-deductible equity backstop premium expense in 2020.
 These amounts primarily represent the impact of tax audit settlements and non-tax deductible penalty costs.

The component of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 31, 2022 for PG&E Corporation and the Utility
was $31 million.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s unrecognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months based on tax audit progress.
Interest income, interest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Tax Settlements
PG&E Corporation’s tax returns have been accepted through 2015 for federal income tax purposes, except for a few matters, the most significant of which
relate to deductible repair costs for gas transmission and distribution lines of business and tax deductions claimed for regulatory fines and fees assessed as part
of the penalty decision issued in 2015 for the San Bruno natural gas explosion in September of 2010. The Internal Revenue Service is auditing tax years 2015
through 2018.
PG&E Corporation’s tax returns have been accepted through 2014 for California income tax purposes. Tax years 2015 and thereafter remain subject to
examination by the State of California. The State of California is auditing tax years 2015 through 2019.
Carryforwards
The following table describes PG&E Corporation’s operating loss and tax credit carryforward balances:
(in millions) December 31, 2022Expiration
Year
Federal:   
Net operating loss carryforward - Pre-2018 $ 3,447 2031 - 2036
Net operating loss carryforward - Post-2017 23,170 N/A
Tax credit carryforward 152 2029 - 2041
State:
Net operating loss carryforward $ 25,169 2039 - 2041
Tax credit carryforward 126 Various
PG&E Corporation does not believe that the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in loss of or limitation on the utilization of any of the tax carryforwards. PG&E
Corporation will continue to monitor the status of tax carryforwards.
Other Tax Matters
In March 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. Under the CARES
Act, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have deferred the payment of 2020 payroll taxes for the remainder of the year to 2021 and 2022. Half of the payment
was paid in 2021, and the other half of the payment was paid in 2022.
Under Section 382 of the IRC, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwards and other tax
attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five
percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership
during the testing period (generally three years). PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles)
that increase a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons) ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to 4.75% or more prior to the
Restriction Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without approval by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation (the “Ownership
Restrictions”). Due to the election to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust for income tax purposes, the calculation of Percentage Stock Ownership (as
defined in the Amended Articles) will effectively be based on a reduced number of shares outstanding, namely the total number of outstanding equity securities
less the number of equity securities held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo. As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E
Corporation has not undergone an ownership change, and consequently, its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section
382 of the IRC.
142
Furthermore, the activities of the Fire Victim Trust are treated as activities of the Utility for tax purposes. Accordingly, PG&E Corporation will recognize
income tax benefits and the corresponding DTA as the Fire Victim Trust sells shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, and the amounts of such benefits
and assets will be impacted by the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the shares, rather than the price at the time such shares were transferred to the Fire
Victim Trust. From inception through December 31, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged Plan Shares in the aggregate amount of 230,000,000 for an equal
number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement; in each case, the Fire Victim Trust thereafter reported
that it sold the applicable New Shares. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock in the aggregate
amount of 230,000,000 shares resulted in an aggregate tax benefit of $870 million recorded in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial
Statements. On January 9, 2023, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged 60,000,000 Plan Shares and thereafter the Fire Victim Trust reported that it sold the
applicable New Shares. An aggregate tax benefit of $256 million will be recorded in January 2023. For more information, see Note 7 above.
NOTE 11: DERIVATIVES
Use of Derivative Instruments
The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities. Procurement costs are recovered through
rates. The Utility uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices. Derivatives
include contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.
Derivatives are presented in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded at fair value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting
arrangements for each counterparty. The fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the
intention to offset exist.
Price risk management activities that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments are not
held for speculative purposes and are subject to certain regulatory requirements. The Utility expects to fully recover through rates all costs related to derivatives
under the applicable ratemaking mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC
directives. Therefore, all unrealized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s
regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of electricity
or the cost of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.
The Utility elects the normal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives. Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that
are expected to be used by the Utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the
commodity delivered.  These items are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

Cash inflows and outflows associated with derivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Some of the Utility’s derivatives instruments, including power purchase agreements, contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from
each of the major credit rating agencies, also known as a credit-risk-related contingent feature. Multiple credit agencies continue to rate the Utility below
investment grade, which results in the Utility posting additional collateral. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility satisfied or has otherwise addressed its
obligations related to the credit-risk related contingency features.
NOTE 12: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
PG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their cash equivalents, trust assets, and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair value
hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
•Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•Level 2 – Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
•Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.
The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
144
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below.  Assets held in rabbi trusts are

Valuation Techniques
The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above. There are no restrictions
on the terms and conditions upon which the investments may be redeemed. There were no material transfers between any levels for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021.
Trust Assets
Assets Measured at Fair Value
In general, investments held in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks. Nuclear decommissioning trust
assets, customer credit trust assets and other trust assets are composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investments
that are money market funds classified as Level 1.
Global equity securities primarily include investments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1. (1)
 (2)
(1)
(2)
146
Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including
corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair
value is determined by observable market prices in active markets. A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities
classified as Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the
valuation model generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are
considered in the valuation model, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient
Investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient
have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts
presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on
exchanges as well as fixed-income securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities, credit securities and asset-backed securities.
Price Risk Management Instruments
Price risk management instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options,
and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter. 
Power purchase agreements, forwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using observable
market forward prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded
futures, or are valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are
valued using observable market data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2. 
Long-dated power purchase agreements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3. These Level 3 contracts are valued using
either estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends
beyond a period for which market data is available.  The Utility utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3 instruments
using pricing inputs from brokers and historical data.
The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the
CAISO auction and between auction dates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices. CRRs are classified as Level 3.
Level 3 Measurements and Uncertainty Analysis
Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determine reasonableness.
Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related to
Level 3 instruments are expected to be recoverable through rates; therefore, there is no impact on net income resulting from changes in the fair value of these
instruments.  See Note 11 above.

impacted.
Financial Instruments
PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value for financial instruments: the fair values of cash, net
accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, customer deposits, and the Utility’s variable rate pollution control bond loan agreements
approximate their carrying values as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as they are short-term in nature.

NOTE 13: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Pension Plan and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (“PBOP”)
PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees hired before December 31, 2012 and a cash
balance plan for those eligible employees hired after this date or who made a one-time election to participate (“Pension Plan”).  Certain trusts underlying these
plans are qualified trusts under the IRC.  If certain conditions are met, PG&E Corporation and the Utility can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts,
subject to certain limitations.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy is to contribute tax-deductible amounts, consistent with applicable
regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  On an annual basis, the Utility funds the pension plan up to the amount it is authorized to
recover through rates.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility also sponsor contributory postretirement medical plans for retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory
postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a fiscal year-end measurement date for all plans.

The actuarial gain for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure the accumulated benefit obligations, offset by unfavorable changes in
demographic assumptions. The actuarial gain for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure the accumulated benefit obligations and
favorable claims cost changes
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the postretirement medical plan and the postretirement life insurance plan were in overfunded positions. The projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan
assets for the postretirement life insurance plan were $259 million and $266 million as of December 31, 2022, and $363 million and $359 million as of December 31, 2021, respectively.

the Consolidated Statements of Income.
There was no material difference between PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the information disclosed above. 
Components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
PG&E Corporation and the Utility record unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses related to pension and post-retirement benefits
other than pension as components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.  In addition, regulatory adjustments are recorded in the
Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the difference between expense or income calculated in accordance with GAAP
for accounting purposes and expense or income for ratemaking purposes, which is based on authorized plan contributions.  For pension benefits, a regulatory
asset or liability is recorded for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.  For post-retirement benefits other
than pension, the Utility generally records a regulatory liability for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.  As
the Utility is unable to record a regulatory asset for these other benefits, the charge remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). (1)

Valuation Assumptions
The following weighted average year-end actuarial assumptions were used in determining the plans’ projected benefit obligations and net benefit costs.
 Pension Plan PBOP Plans
 December 31, December 31,
 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020
Discount rate 5.54 % 3.03 % 2.77 % 5.50 - 5.54% 2.97 - 3.04% 2.67 - 2.80%
Rate of future compensation
increases 3.80 % 3.80 % 3.80 % N/A N/A N/A
Expected return on plan assets 6.10 % 5.50 % 5.10 % 3.70 - 7.30% 3.30 - 6.40% 3.10 - 6.10%
Interest crediting rate for cash
balance plan 4.19 % 1.95 % 1.95 % N/A N/A N/A
The assumed health care cost trend rate as of December 31, 2022 was 6.5%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of approximately 4.5% in 2031 and
beyond.
Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset
allocations of the employee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were
projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of
dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term inflation rate.  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 6.1% compares to a ten-year actual
return of 5.8%.  The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately
848 Aa-grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2022.  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated
future cash flows for the pension benefits and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average
discount rate.
Investment Policies and Strategies
The financial position of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit
obligations.  Volatility in funded status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial
reporting, as well as the amount of minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of
funded status volatility. 
The trusts’ asset allocations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings.  Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key
determinants of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest
rate changes also influence liability valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
trusts hold significant allocations in long maturity fixed-income investments. Although they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to
reduce long-term funding costs due to their higher expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust’s holdings in
equity and fixed-income investments by exhibiting returns with low correlation to the direction of these markets. Real assets include global real estate
investment trusts (“REITS”), global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios. 
Derivative instruments such as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure. Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S.
treasury futures, are also used to rebalance the allocation between fixed income and equity of the pension’s portfolio. Foreign currency exchange contracts are
used to hedge a portion of the non U.S. dollar exposure of global equity investments.
154
The target asset allocation percentages for major categories of trust assets for pension and other benefit plans are as follows:
 Pension Plan PBOP Plans
 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021
Global equity securities 26 % 30 % 30 % 28 % 26 % 36 %
Absolute return 1 % 2 % 2 % 1 % 1 % 1 %

Fixed-income securities 65 % 60 % 60 % 68 % 70 % 58 %
Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %
PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guiding
principles of this risk management framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper
accountability and documentation.  Trust investment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversification,
manage risk through appropriate use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.

In addition to the total plan assets disclosed at fair value in the table above, the trusts had other net liabilities of $11 million and $175 million at December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, comprised primarily of cash, accounts receivable, deferred taxes, and accounts payable. 
Valuation Techniques
The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.  All investments that are
valued using a NAV per share can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.
155
Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1
and Level 2 assets.
Global Equity Securities
The global equity category includes investments in common stock and equity-index futures.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on public
exchanges and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets for
identical securities.  Equity-index futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.
Real Assets
The real asset category includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  The
commodity futures, global REITS, and global listed infrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1
assets. 
Fixed-Income Securities
Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including
corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair
value is determined by observable market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified
as Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation
model generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in
the valuation model, as applicable.
Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient
Investments in the trusts that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables
above. The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These
investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges, fixed-income securities that are composed
primarily of U.S. government securities, credit securities and asset-backed securities, and real assets and absolute return investments that are held to diversify
the trust’s holdings in equity and fixed-income securities.
Transfers Between Levels
No material transfers between levels occurred in the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Cash Flow Information
Employer Contributions
PG&E Corporation and the Utility contributed $339 million to the pension benefit plans and $26 million to the other benefit plans in 2022.  These contributions
are consistent with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicable
regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  None of these pension or other benefits were subject to a minimum funding requirement
requiring a cash contribution in 2022.  The Utility’s pension benefits met all the funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to make total contributions of approximately $327 million to the pension plan in 2023. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility did not request to make contributions to the other postretirement benefit plans in the 2023 GRC.
Benefits Payments and Receipts
As of December 31, 2022, the estimated benefits expected to be paid and the estimated federal subsidies expected to be received in each of the next five fiscal
years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:

There were no material differences between the estimated benefits expected to be paid by PG&E Corporation and paid by the Utility for the years presented
above.  There were also no material differences between the estimated subsidies expected to be received by PG&E Corporation and received by the Utility for
the years presented above.
Retirement Savings Plan
PG&E Corporation sponsors a retirement savings plan, which qualifies as a 401(k) defined contribution benefit plan under the IRC. This plan permits eligible
employees to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions into the plan, and provides for employer contributions to be made to eligible participants.  Total expenses
recognized for defined contribution benefit plans reflected in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income were $144 million, $133 million, and
$119 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2019 PG&E Corporation changed its default matching contributions under its 401(k)
plan from PG&E Corporation common stock to cash. Beginning in March 2019, at PG&E Corporation’s directive, the 401(k) plan trustee began purchasing
new shares in the PG&E Corporation common stock fund on the open market rather than directly from PG&E Corporation.
There were no material differences between the employer contribution expense for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.
NOTE 14: RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS
The Utility and other subsidiaries provide and receive various services to and from their parent, PG&E Corporation, and among themselves.  The Utility and
PG&E Corporation exchange administrative and professional services in support of operations.  Services provided directly to PG&E Corporation by the Utility
are priced at the higher of fully loaded cost (i.e., direct cost of good or service and allocation of overhead costs) or fair market value, depending on the nature
of the services.  Services provided directly to the Utility by PG&E Corporation are generally priced at the lower of fully loaded cost or fair market value,
depending on the nature and value of the services.  PG&E Corporation also allocates various corporate administrative and general costs to the Utility and other
subsidiaries using agreed-upon allocation factors, including the number of employees, operating and maintenance expenses, total assets, and other cost
allocation methodologies.  Management believes that the methods used to allocate expenses are reasonable and meet the reporting and accounting requirements
of its regulatory agencies.

NOTE 15: WILDFIRE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES
Liability Overview
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to wildfires. A provision for a
loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a charge that
reflects their best estimate or the lower end of the range, if there is no better estimate.
Assessing whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, whether the loss or a range of losses is estimable, and the amount of the best estimate or lower end
of the range often requires management to exercise significant judgment about future events. Management makes these assessments based on a number of
assumptions and subjective factors, including negotiations (including those during mediations with claimants), discovery, settlements and payments, rulings,
advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter, and estimates based on currently available information and prior
experience with wildfires.
Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information. As more information becomes available,
including from potential claimants as litigation or resolution efforts progress, management estimates and assumptions regarding the potential financial impacts
of wildfire events may change. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as
incurred. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome
of the following matters.
Potential liabilities related to wildfires depend on various factors, including the cause of the fire, contributing causes of the fire (including alternative potential
origins, weather- and climate-related issues, and forest management and fire suppression practices), the number, size and type of structures damaged or
destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for
claimants, the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the
Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties, fines, or restitution that may be imposed by courts or other governmental
entities.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of numerous civil complaints related to the following wildfire events and expect that they may receive further
such complaints. The complaints include claims based on multiple theories of liability, including inverse condemnation, negligence, violations of the Public
Utilities Code, violations of the Health & Safety Code, premises liability, trespass, public nuisance and private nuisance. The plaintiffs in each action
principally assert that PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to properly maintain, inspect, and de-energize their transmission lines was the cause
of the relevant wildfire. The timing and outcome for resolution of any such claims or investigations are uncertain. The Utility believes it will continue to
receive additional information from potential claimants in connection with these wildfire events as litigation or resolution efforts progress. Any such additional
information may potentially allow PG&E Corporation and the Utility to refine the estimates of their accrued losses and may result in changes to the accrual
depending on the information received. PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to vigorously defend themselves against both criminal charges and civil
complaints.
If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are judicially determined to be the substantial cause of the following matters,
and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees without
having been found negligent. California courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders
against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the
community that benefited from such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs through rates. Further,
California courts have determined that the doctrine of inverse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the
utility for any such costs. The CPUC may decide not to authorize cost recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of
the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. In addition to claims for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees under
inverse condemnation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury
damages, punitive damages and other damages under other theories of liability in connection with the following wildfire events, including if PG&E
Corporation or the Utility were found to have been negligent.
159
Unless expressly noted otherwise, the loss accruals in this Note reflect the lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could be greater than the accrued estimated amounts but are unable to
reasonably estimate the additional loss and the upper end of the range because, as described above, there are a number of unknown facts and legal
considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&E
Corporation and the Utility and the outcome of the criminal proceeding initiated against the Utility in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. If the liability for
wildfires were to exceed $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any Coverage Year, the Utility may be eligible to make a claim to the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 to
satisfy settled or finally adjudicated eligible claims in excess of such amount, except that claims related to the 2019 Kincade fire would be subject to the 40%
limitation on the allowed amount of claims arising before emergence from bankruptcy. PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to continue to review the
available information and other information as it becomes available, including evidence in the possession of Cal Fire, USFS, or the relevant district attorney’s
office, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted, and additional information about the nature and extent of personal and
business property damages and losses, the nature, number and severity of personal injuries, and information made available through the discovery process.
2019 Kincade Fire
According to Cal Fire, on October 23, 2019 at approximately 9:27 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began northeast of Geyserville in Sonoma County, California
(the “2019 Kincade fire”), located in the service area of the Utility. According to a Cal Fire incident update dated March 3, 2020, 3:35 p.m. Pacific Time, the
2019 Kincade fire consumed 77,758 acres and resulted in no fatalities, four first responder injuries, 374 structures destroyed, and 60 structures damaged. In
connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, state and local officials issued numerous mandatory evacuation orders and evacuation warnings. Based on County of
Sonoma information, PG&E Corporation and the Utility understand that the geographic zones subject to either a mandatory evacuation order or an evacuation
warning between October 23, 2019 and November 4, 2019 included approximately 200,000 persons.
On July 16, 2020, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the Utility’s equipment caused the 2019 Kincade fire.
On April 6, 2021, the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office (“the Sonoma D.A.”) filed a complaint charging the Utility with five felonies and 28
misdemeanors related to the 2019 Kincade fire. On January 28, 2022, the Sonoma D.A. filed the Kincade Amended Complaint, which replaced two felonies
with five different felonies and dropped six misdemeanor counts. On April 8, 2022, the Utility and the Sonoma D.A. filed a civil stipulated judgment to resolve
the criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire (the “Kincade Stipulation”) without the Utility admitting any liability. Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Kincade Stipulation, the Utility will pay a total of $20.25 million, which will not be recoverable through rates. Pursuant to
the Kincade Stipulation, the Utility has also agreed to: (i) fill at least 80 new internal employee positions headquartered in or serving Sonoma County; (ii) take
certain wildfire mitigation actions consistent with its WMP; and (iii) engage an independent compliance monitor for at least five years to monitor the Utility’s
compliance with certain commitments under the Kincade Stipulation, including its commitments to carry out vegetation management and equipment
inspections in Sonoma County consistent with its WMP. After the Kincade Stipulation was entered by the Sonoma County Superior Court, the Sonoma D.A.
moved to dismiss the Kincade Amended Complaint with prejudice, and the court granted the motion on April 11, 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility recorded $20.25 million within Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in connection with the Kincade Stipulation.
As of December 31, 2022, $5.45 million has been paid pursuant to the Kincade Stipulation.
On July 14, 2022, the CPUC issued final approval of a settlement between the SED and the Utility (the “Kincade SED Settlement”). The Kincade SED
Settlement resolves SED’s investigation into the 2019 Kincade fire and provides for the removal of approximately 70 transmission lines or portions of lines that
are no longer in service and are de-energized but have not been removed as required by CPUC rules. The Kincade SED Settlement provides that the Utility (i)
will pay $40 million to California’s General Fund; (ii) will remove permanently abandoned transmission lines over a ten-year period; and (iii) must incur
$85 million of the costs of such work by December 31, 2024, for which it may not seek recovery. SED agreed to refrain from instituting enforcement
proceedings against the Utility for not having removed the lines previously. The Kincade SED Settlement states that it does not constitute an admission by the
Utility of violations of GOs or statutory requirements. In the third quarter of 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $40 million within Other
current liabilities in connection with the Kincade SED Settlement. As of December 31, 2022, $20 million has been paid to California’s General Fund pursuant
to the Kincade SED Settlement. For the $85 million of cost of removal that the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility recorded such disallowances in the
first quarter of 2022 upon identification of the facilities to be removed.
160
As of February 16, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 113 complaints on behalf of at least 2,720 plaintiffs related to the 2019
Kincade fire. The plaintiffs filed master complaints on July 16, 2021; PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s response was filed on August 16, 2021; and PG&E
Corporation and the Utility filed a demurrer with respect to the plaintiffs’ inverse condemnation claims. On December 10, 2021, the court overruled the
demurrer. The court scheduled trial for November 7, 2022, which it vacated on October 11, 2022.
In addition, on January 5, 2022, Cal Fire filed a complaint against the Utility in the coordinated proceeding seeking to recover approximately $90 million for
fire suppression and other costs incurred in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. The Utility filed an answer to Cal Fire’s complaint on February 4, 2022.
On April 28, 2022, subrogation plaintiffs filed a motion for summary adjudication of their inverse condemnation cause of action in the coordinated proceeding.
The court scheduled a hearing on this summary adjudication motion for August 5, 2022, which it vacated on July 29, 2022. On October 26, 2022, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility entered an agreement with substantially all of the insurance subrogation plaintiffs to resolve their claims arising from the 2019
Kincade fire.
Additionally, on July 20, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion for summary adjudication on individual plaintiffs’ claims for punitive
damages. The court scheduled a hearing on this summary adjudication motion for October 7, 2022, which it vacated on October 6, 2022.
On October 11, 2022, the Utility entered into a tolling agreement with the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (“Cal OES”), which remains in
effect.
Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the
Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. PG&E Corporation
and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $800 million as of December 31, 2021 (before available insurance). Based on the facts and
circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded additional charges during
2022 for potential losses in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire of $225 million, for an aggregate liability of $1.025 billion (before available insurance).
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $1.025 billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or
fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect
of compensation claims by federal or state agencies other than state fire suppression costs, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not
reasonably estimable.
The following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable range of losses for claims
arising from the 2019 Kincade fire since December 31, 2021.
Loss Accrual (in millions)
Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 769 
Accrued Losses 225 
Payments (344)
Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 650 
The Utility has liability insurance coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2019 Kincade fire in an aggregate amount of $430 million. As of
December 31, 2022, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable for the full amount of $430 million.
2020 Zogg Fire
According to Cal Fire, on September 27, 2020, at approximately 4:03 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began in the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane,
north of Igo in Shasta County, California (the “2020 Zogg fire”), located in the service area of the Utility. According to a Cal Fire incident update dated
October 16, 2020, 3:08 p.m. Pacific Time, the 2020 Zogg fire consumed 56,338 acres and resulted in four fatalities, one injury, 204 structures destroyed, and 27
structures damaged.
On March 22, 2021, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the 2020 Zogg fire was caused by a pine tree contacting electrical facilities
owned and operated by the Utility located north of the community of Igo.
161
On September 24, 2021, the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office charged the Utility with 11 felonies and 20 misdemeanors related to the 2020 Zogg fire,
the 2020 Daniel fire, the 2020 Ponder fire, and the 2021 Woody fire. On September 24, 2021, PG&E Corporation and the Utility announced that they disputed
the charges. They further announced that they would accept Cal Fire’s finding that a Utility electric line caused the 2020 Zogg fire, even though PG&E
Corporation and the Utility did not have access to all of the evidence that Cal Fire gathered. On November 18, 2021, the Utility filed a demurrer to 10 of the 31
counts. On May 2, 2022, the Shasta County Superior Court overruled the demurrer. On June 9, 2022, the Utility entered a plea of not guilty to all of the
charges. At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing conducted in January and February 2023, the court dismissed 20 of the 31 counts, including all charges
related to the three smaller fires as well as all charges relating to air contamination. On February 3, 2023, the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office filed a
superseding charging document, which charges the Utility with the 11 remaining counts. The court has set a trial date on those charges for June 6, 2023.
Under California law (including Penal Code section 1202.4), if the Utility were convicted of any of the charges, the sentencing court must order the Utility to
“make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order” that is “sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every
determined economic loss incurred as the result of” the Utility’s underlying conduct, in addition to interest and the victim’s or victims’ attorneys’ fees. This
requirement for full reimbursement of economic loss is not waivable by either the government or the victims and is not offset by any compensation that the
victims have received or may receive from their insurance carriers. If convicted of any of the charges, the Utility could be subject to fines, penalties, and
restitution to victims for their economic losses (including property damage, medical and mental health expenses, lost wages, lost profits, attorneys’ fees and
interest), as well as non-monetary remedies such as oversight requirements. If convicted of any of the charges, the Utility currently believes that its total losses
associated with the fire could materially exceed the accrued estimated liabilities that PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded to reflect the lower end
of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses. The Utility is unable to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of such additional losses. The
Utility does not expect that any of its liability insurance would be available to cover restitution payments ordered by the court presiding over the criminal
proceeding.
On October 25, 2022, the SED issued a proposed administrative enforcement order alleging that the Utility violated CPUC regulations and Public Utilities
Code Section 451 in connection with the CPUC’s investigation of the 2020 Zogg fire. The proposed order recommends a penalty of $155 million. On February
21, 2023, the Utility and the SED filed a joint motion for approval of a settlement agreement (the “Zogg SED Settlement”). The Zogg SED Settlement provides
that the Utility would (i) pay $10 million to California’s General Fund; (ii) implement certain enhancements to its vegetation management processes; (iii) incur
$140 million in connection with certain initiatives specified in the Zogg SED Settlement, and the Utility may not seek recovery of this $140 million of costs.
The SED agreed to refrain from instituting any further enforcement proceedings against the Utility related to the 2020 Zogg fire. The Zogg SED Settlement
states that it does not constitute an admission or evidence of any wrongdoing, fault, omission, negligence, imprudence, or liability on the part of the Utility. In
connection with the Zogg SED Settlement, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability of $10 million reflected in Other current liabilities on the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the $140 million of costs for which the Utility will not seek recovery, the Utility
expects to record disallowances as such costs are incurred.
Various other entities, which may include other law enforcement agencies, may also be investigating the fire. It is uncertain when any such investigations will
be complete.
As of February 16, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 29 complaints on behalf of at least 523 plaintiffs related to the 2020
Zogg fire. The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees
and other damages. The plaintiffs filed master complaints on August 6, 2021, and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s answer was filed on September 7,
2021, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a demurrer with respect to the plaintiffs’ inverse condemnation claims. On December 10, 2021, the court
overruled the demurrer. The court has set a trial date in the coordinated proceeding for August 14, 2023.
In addition, on March 18, 2022, Cal Fire filed a complaint against the Utility in the coordinated proceeding seeking to recover approximately $34.5 million for
fire suppression and other costs incurred in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. The Utility filed an answer to Cal Fire’s complaint on May 3, 2022. The Utility
and Cal Fire reached a settlement of Cal Fire’s claims and dismissal of Cal Fire’s complaint with prejudice was entered on December 22, 2022. On September
26, 2022, the Utility entered into a tolling agreement with Cal OES, which remains in effect.
162
Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the
Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. PG&E Corporation and
the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $375 million as of December 31, 2021 (before available insurance). Based on the facts and
circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded additional charges for
potential losses in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire of $25 million, for an aggregate liability of $400 million (before available insurance).
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties, fines, or restitution
that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of
compensation claims by federal or state agencies other than state fire suppression costs, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably
estimable.
The following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable range of losses for claims
arising from the 2020 Zogg fire since December 31, 2021.
Loss Accrual (in millions)
Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 211 
Accrued Losses 25 
Payments (204)
Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 32 
The Utility has liability insurance for third-party liability attributable to the 2020 Zogg fire in an aggregate amount of $611 million. As of December 31, 2022,
the Utility recorded an insurance receivable for $370 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire, which equals the $400
million probable loss estimate less an initial self-insured retention of $60 million, plus $30 million in legal fees incurred. Recovery under the Utility’s wildfire
insurance policies for the 2021 Dixie fire will reduce the amount of insurance proceeds available for the 2020 Zogg fire by the same amount up to $600 million
and vice versa.
2021 Dixie Fire
According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report on the 2021 Dixie fire (the “Cal Fire Investigation Report”), on July 13, 2021, at approximately 5:07 p.m.
Pacific Time, a wildfire began in the Feather River Canyon near Cresta Dam (the “2021 Dixie fire”), located in the service area of the Utility. According to the
Cal Fire Investigation Report, the 2021 Dixie fire consumed 963,309 acres and resulted in 1,311 structures destroyed and 94 structures damaged (including 763
residential homes, 12 multi-family homes, 8 commercial residential homes, 148 nonresidential commercial structures, and 466 detached structures), and four
first-responder injuries. The Cal Fire Investigation Report does not attribute a fatality that was previously published in an October 25, 2021 Cal Fire incident
report to the 2021 Dixie fire.
163
On January 4, 2022, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the 2021 Dixie fire was caused by a tree contacting electrical distribution lines
owned and operated by the Utility. On June 7, 2022, the Utility received a copy of the Cal Fire Investigation Report, which states that the fire ignited when a
tree fell and contacted electrical distribution lines owned and operated by the Utility, and the Cal Fire Investigation Report has been made publicly available.
The Cal Fire Investigation Report alleges that the Utility acted negligently in its response to the initial outage and fault that caused the 2021 Dixie fire. The Cal
Fire Investigation Report also alleges that the subject tree had visible outward signs of damage and decay which would have been noticeable at the ground
level, and that a brief visual inspection should have discovered the decay. Based on the information currently available to the Utility, including its inspection
records, operating and inspection protocols and procedures, implementation of those protocols and procedures, and day-of-event response, the Utility believes
its personnel acted reasonably (within the meaning of the applicable prudency standard discussed under “Regulatory Recovery” below) given the information
available at the time and followed applicable policies and protocols both before ignition and in the day-of-event response. While an intervenor in a future cost
recovery proceeding may argue the Cal Fire Investigation Report itself creates serious doubt with respect to the reasonableness of the Utility’s conduct, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility do not believe the report identifies sufficient facts to shift the burden of proof applicable in a proceeding for cost recovery to the
Utility. (See “Regulatory Recovery” and “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054”). PG&E Corporation and the Utility disagree with many allegations in the Cal Fire
Investigation Report and plan to vigorously contest them. However, if the CPUC or the FERC were to reach conclusions similar to those of the Cal Fire
Investigation Report, it may determine that the Utility had been imprudent, in which case some or all of its costs recorded to the WEMA would not be
recoverable, the Utility would not be able to recover costs through FERC TO rates, or the Utility would be required to reimburse the Wildfire Fund for the costs
and expenses that are allocated to it.
The District Attorneys’ Offices of Butte County, Plumas County, Shasta County, Lassen County and Tehama County (the “North State Counties”), as well as
the SED and OEIS, have been investigating the fire; various other entities, which may include other state and federal law enforcement agencies, may also be
investigating the fire. The United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California issued a subpoena for documents as well. PG&E Corporation
and the Utility are cooperating with the investigations. Except for the investigation by the District Attorneys of the North State Counties, it is uncertain when
any other such investigations will be complete. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2021 Dixie
fire. This investigation is ongoing.
On April 11, 2022, the Utility and the District Attorneys of the North State Counties filed a civil stipulated judgment to permanently resolve any potential state
criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire (the “Dixie Stipulation”) without the Utility admitting any liability, and the court
entered the judgment on that same date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Dixie Stipulation, the Utility will pay a total of $34.75 million, which will
not be recoverable through rates. Pursuant to the Dixie Stipulation, the Utility has also agreed to: (i) fill at least 80 new internal employee positions
headquartered in or serving the North State Counties; (ii) take certain other wildfire mitigation actions consistent with its WMP; (iii) engage an independent
compliance monitor for five years to monitor the Utility’s compliance with certain commitments under the Dixie Stipulation, including its commitments to
carry out vegetation management and equipment inspections in the North State Counties consistent with its WMP; (iv) take good faith steps to initiate
mediations with certain commercial timber landowners; and (v) initiate an expedited compensation program under which individuals whose homes, including
mobile homes, were destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire can submit an electronic claim form and supporting documentation, and the Utility will make them an
offer to resolve their loss based on an objective, pre-determined valuation framework. The Dixie Stipulation also permanently resolved any potential state
criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2021 Fly fire, which merged with the 2021 Dixie fire. In the first quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation
and the Utility recorded $34.75 million within Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in connection with the Dixie Stipulation. As of
December 31, 2022, $30.75 million has been paid pursuant to the Dixie Stipulation.
On January 17, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reached an agreement with certain public entities to settle their claims for $24 million.
As of February 16, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 81 complaints on behalf of at least 2,094 plaintiffs related to the 2021
Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further such complaints. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damage, economic loss, punitive
damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages. On February 2, 2023, the court vacated the prior trial date and continued it to August 28,
2023. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to enter into an agreement with the insurance subrogation plaintiffs in the 2021 Dixie fire litigation to resolve
their claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire.
164
Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the
Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire. PG&E Corporation and
the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $1.15 billion as of the year ended December 31, 2021 (before available recoveries). As a result of the
public entities settlement, the aggregate liability increased to $1.175 billion as of December 31, 2022.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $1.175 billion represent only claims based on the doctrine of inverse condemnation and do
not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E
Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or
federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.
As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs
from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests. As to these damages, PG&E Corporation
and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for
any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on
the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021
Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land
and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national park and national forests that were affected by the 2021
Dixie fire. According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $650 million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire. The Utility
estimates that the fire burned approximately 70,000 acres of national parks and approximately 685,000 acres of national forests.
The following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable range of losses for claims
arising from the 2021 Dixie fire since December 31, 2021.
Loss Accrual (in millions)
Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 1,150 
Accrued Losses 25 
Payments (44)
Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 1,131 
The Utility has liability insurance coverage for third-party liability in an aggregate amount of $900 million. Recovery under the Utility’s wildfire insurance
policies for the 2020 Zogg fire will reduce the amount of insurance proceeds available for the 2021 Dixie fire by the same amount up to $600 million and vice
versa. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable of $530 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2021
Dixie fire, which equals the aggregate $900 million of available insurance coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2021 Dixie fire, less the $370
million insurance receivable recorded in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire.
As of December 31, 2022, the Utility recorded a Wildfire Fund receivable of $175 million for probable recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire. AB
1054 provides that the CPUC may allocate costs and expenses in the application for cost recovery in full or in part taking into account factors both within and
beyond the utility’s control that may have exacerbated the costs and expenses, including humidity, temperature, and winds. PG&E Corporation and the Utility
believe that, even if it found that the Utility acted unreasonably, the CPUC would nevertheless authorize recovery in part. See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054”
below. The Utility also recorded a $115 million reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be probable of
recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and a $388 million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the WEMA.
See “Regulatory Recovery” below. Decreases in the amount of the insurance receivable for the 2021 Dixie fire may also increase the amount that is probable of
recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and the WEMA. The WEMA regulatory asset increased by $41 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.
165
2022 Mosquito Fire
On September 6, 2022, at approximately 6:17 p.m. Pacific Time, the Utility was notified that a wildfire had ignited near OxBow Reservoir in Placer County,
California (the “2022 Mosquito fire”), located in the service area of the Utility. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group’s InciWeb incident overview dated
November 4, 2022 at 6:30 p.m. Pacific Time indicated that the 2022 Mosquito fire had consumed approximately 76,788 acres at that time. It also indicated no
fatalities, no injuries, 13 structures damaged, and 78 structures destroyed and that the fire was 100% contained.
The USFS has indicated to the Utility an initial assessment that the fire started in the area of the Utility’s power line on National Forest System lands and that
the USFS is conducting a criminal investigation into the 2022 Mosquito fire. On September 24, 2022, the USFS removed and took possession of one of the
Utility’s transmission poles and attached equipment. The USFS has not issued a determination as to the cause.
The cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire remains under investigation by the USFS and the DOJ, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility are cooperating with the
investigation. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received document and information requests from the DOJ. It is uncertain when any such investigations
will be complete. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire. This investigation is
preliminary, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not currently have access to the evidence in the possession of the USFS, the DOJ, or other third parties.
The CPUC and other entities may also be investigating the 2022 Mosquito fire. It is uncertain when any such investigations will be complete.
As of February 16, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately six complaints on behalf of at least 236 individual plaintiffs related to
the 2022 Mosquito fire and expect that they may receive further such complaints. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also are aware of a complaint on behalf of
the Placer County Water Agency and a complaint on behalf of El Dorado County, Placer County, Georgetown Divide Public Utility District, Georgetown Fire
Protection District, and El Dorado County Water Agency. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damage, economic loss, punitive damages,
exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.
Based on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the
Utility as of the date of this filing, including the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire. PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the
aggregate amount of $100 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 (before available recoveries). The aggregate liability remained unchanged as of
December 31, 2022.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses represent only claims based on the doctrine of inverse condemnation and do not include, among
other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility,
(ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs
and damages related to federal land, (iv) evacuation costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable. The Utility’s accrued estimated losses
also do not include any assumptions regarding offsetting recoveries from third-parties (outside of the Utility’s insurers).
As noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression
costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests. As to these damages, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of
possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts
that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the
2022 Mosquito fire.
The Utility has liability insurance coverage for third-party liability in an aggregate amount of $940 million, with a deductible of $60 million. As of December
31, 2022, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable of $45 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire. As of
December 31, 2022, the Utility also recorded a $10 million reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be
probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and a $50 million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through
the WEMA. See “Regulatory Recovery” below.
166
Loss Recoveries
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recovery mechanisms available for wildfire liabilities including from insurance, customers, and the Wildfire Fund.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a receivable for a recovery when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur, and the Utility can
reasonably estimate the amount or its range. While the Utility plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing
of such recoveries. For more information on the applicable facts and circumstances of the corresponding wildfires, see “2019 Kincade Fire,” “2020 Zogg Fire,”
“2021 Dixie Fire,” and “2022 Mosquito Fire.”
Total probable recoveries for the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire as of December 31, 2022 are:
Potential Recovery Source (in millions) 2022 Mosquito fire 2021 Dixie fire
Insurance $ 45 $ 530 
FERC TO rates 10 115
WEMA 50 388 
Wildfire Fund — 175 
Probable recoveries at December 31, 2022 $ 105 $ 1,208 
The Utility could be subject to significant liability in connection with these wildfire events. If such liability is not recoverable from insurance or the other
mechanisms described in this section, it could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, and cash flows.
Insurance
Insurance Coverage
In April 2022, the Utility purchased approximately $340 million in wildfire liability insurance coverage for the period from April 1, 2022 to April 1, 2023, at a
cost of approximately $263 million. Additionally, the Utility purchased approximately $600 million in wildfire liability insurance in August 2022 for the period
from August 1, 2022 to August 1, 2023, at a cost of approximately $516 million. The Utility’s wildfire liability insurance is subject to an initial self-insured
retention of $60 million.
In April 2022, the Utility purchased approximately $725 million in non-wildfire liability coverage for the period from April 1, 2022 to April 1, 2023 at a cost of
approximately $154 million. The Utility’s non-wildfire liability insurance is subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million.
As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had prepaid insurance of $424 million, reflected in Other current assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
Various coverage limitations applicable to different insurance layers could result in material uninsured costs in the future depending on the amount and type of
damages resulting from covered events.
In the Utility’s 2020 GRC proceeding, the CPUC also approved a settlement agreement provision that allows the Utility to recover annual insurance costs for
up to $1.4 billion in excess liability insurance coverage. For more information about the RTBA, see Note 4 above.
Insurance Receivable
Through December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $430 million, $370 million, $530 million, and $45 million for probable insurance
recoveries in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, respectively. PG&E Corporation and
the Utility intend to seek full recovery for all insured losses.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the accrued insurance recoveries decreased for the 2021 Dixie fire with a corresponding increase to the 2020 Zogg fire for $33 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility resolved property related claims in the amount of $418 million, net of self-
insured retention, of which approximately $13 million is reflected in Accounts receivable, other on the Consolidated Financial Statements (excluded from the
table above).
Regulatory Recovery
Section 451.1 of the Public Utilities Code provides that when determining an application to recover costs and expenses arising from a covered wildfire, the
CPUC shall allow cost recovery if the costs and expenses are just and reasonable (i.e., the “prudency standard”). AB 1054 states that a utility with a valid safety
certification for the time period in which a covered wildfire ignited “shall be deemed to have been reasonable” unless “a party to the proceeding creates a
serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the [Utility’s] conduct,” in which case the burden shifts to the utility to prove its conduct was reasonable. The Utility
had a valid safety certification at the time of the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, so any analysis of cost recovery starts with this presumption. AB
1054 also allows the CPUC to allocate costs and expenses “in full or in part taking into account factors both within and beyond the Utility’s control that may
have exacerbated the costs and expenses, including humidity, temperature, and winds.”
The Utility’s recorded receivables under the WEMA and with respect to the Wildfire Fund take into account this revised prudency standard and the
presumption of reasonableness of the Utility’s conduct, based on the Utility’s interpretation of AB 1054 and the information currently available to the Utility.
Although the concept of “serious doubt” has been applied in other regulatory proceedings, such as FERC proceedings, the revised prudency standard under AB
1054 has not been interpreted or applied by the CPUC and it is possible that the CPUC could interpret or apply the standard differently, in which case the
Utility may not be able to recover all or a portion of expenses that it has recorded as a receivable.
FERC TO rates
The Utility recognizes income and reduces its regulatory liability for potential refund through future FERC TO formula rates for a portion of the third-party
wildfire-related claims in excess of insurance coverage. The FERC presumes that a utility’s expenditures are prudent and permits cost recovery unless a party
raises a serious doubt regarding the prudency of such costs. The allocation to transmission customers was based on a FERC-approved allocation factor as
determined in the formula rate. Based on information currently available to the Utility regarding the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, as of
December 31, 2022, the Utility recorded reductions of $115 million and $10 million, respectively, to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that
were determined to be probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate.
WEMA
The WEMA provides for tracking of incremental wildfire claims, outside legal costs, and insurance premiums above those authorized in rates. With respect to
wildfire claims and outside legal costs, the Utility expects that the same prudency standard as applies to the Wildfire Fund would also be applied in any CPUC
review of an application filed by the Utility seeking recovery of such costs recorded to the WEMA. See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” below. As of
December 31, 2022, based on information currently available to the Utility, incremental wildfire claims-related costs for the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022
Mosquito fire were determined to be probable of recovery and the Utility recorded $388 million and $50 million, respectively, as regulatory assets in the
WEMA. Cost recovery for incremental insurance premiums is addressed through balancing account mechanisms. (1)

Wildfire Fund under AB 1054
On July 12, 2019, the California governor signed into law AB 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will be available for
eligible electric utility companies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable
electric utility company’s equipment, subject to the terms and conditions of AB 1054. Each of California’s large electric IOUs has elected to participate in the
Wildfire Fund. Eligible claims are claims for third-party damages resulting from any such wildfires, limited to the portion of such claims that exceeds the
greater of (i) $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any Coverage Year and (ii) the amount of insurance coverage required to be in place for the electric utility
company pursuant to Section 3293 of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054. The accrued Wildfire Fund receivable as of December 31, 2022 reflects an
expectation that the Coverage Year will be based on the calendar year.
Electric utility companies that draw from the Wildfire Fund will only be required to reimburse amounts that are determined by the CPUC in a proceeding for
cost recovery not to be just and reasonable, applying the prudency standard in AB 1054 and after allocating costs and expenses for cost recovery based on
relevant factors both within and outside of a utility’s control that may have exacerbated the costs and expenses, subject to a disallowance cap equal to 20% of
the IOU’s transmission and distribution equity rate base. For the Utility, the disallowance cap would be approximately $3.0 billion based on its 2022 equity rate
base, which is subject to adjustment based on changes in the Utility’s total transmission and distribution equity rate base and would apply for a three calendar-
year period. The disallowance cap is inapplicable in certain circumstances, including if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility
company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted “conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,” or the
electric utility company failed to maintain a valid safety certification. Costs that the CPUC determines to be just and reasonable in accordance with the
prudency standard in AB 1054 will not be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, resulting in a draw-down of the Wildfire Fund.
Before the expiration of any current safety certification, the Utility must request a new safety certification from the OEIS, which the Utility expects to be issued
within 90 days if the Utility has provided documentation that it has satisfied the requirements for the safety certification pursuant to Section 8389(e) of the
Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054. An issued safety certification is valid for 12 months or until a timely request for a new safety certification is acted
upon, whichever occurs later. The safety certification is separate from the CPUC’s enforcement authority and does not preclude the CPUC from pursuing
remedies for safety or other applicable violations. On December 13, 2022, OEIS approved the Utility’s 2022 application and issued the Utility’s 2022 safety
certification.
The Wildfire Fund and disallowance cap will be terminated when the amounts therein are exhausted. The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with (i)
$10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds supported by a 15-year extension of the DWR charge to customers, (ii) $7.5 billion in initial contributions from California’s
three large electric IOUs and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid by California’s three large electric IOUs for a 10-year period.
The Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could
be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utility companies. The Wildfire Fund is
available to pay for the Utility’s eligible claims arising as of July 12, 2019, the effective date of AB 1054, subject to a limit of 40% of the allowed amount of
such claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 and the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11. The 40% limit does not apply to eligible claims that
arise after the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.
As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $175 million in Other noncurrent assets for Wildfire Fund receivables related to the
2021 Dixie fire.

Wildfire-Related Securities Claims, Fire Victim Trust D&O Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries Overview
As further described under the headings “Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action” and “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims—Claims in the Bankruptcy Court
Process,” PG&E Corporation and the Utility face certain wildfire-related securities claims related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other claims
related to the 2018 Camp fire and the PSPS program in the Chapter 11 Cases (i.e., the Subordinated Claims), and certain former directors, current and former
officers, and underwriters of certain note offerings face wildfire-related securities claims in the District Court action. These securities claims are collectively
referred to in this section as the “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims.”
169
Based on discussions with certain holders of Wildfire-Related Securities Claims, as well as the terms of the FVT D&O Claims Settlement Agreement (as
defined below) and the settlement agreements with certain carriers of the D&O Insurance policies, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that it will incur a
loss in connection with the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims. As of December 31, 2022 and each as further described below:
•For the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims, based on discussions with the plaintiffs in the consolidated securities action, PG&E Corporation recorded
a liability in the aggregate amount of $300 million (before available insurance), which represents its best estimate of probable losses for such claims,
though actual losses could be greater or less than this estimate.
•For the Insurance Coverage Claims, PG&E Corporation entered into agreements with certain of its D&O Insurance carriers to settle the majority of
the Insurance Coverage Claims and has received the full settlement amount of $272 million.
•For the Fire Victim Trust D&O Claims, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (the “FVT D&O Claims Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to
which PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and certain former director and officer defendants paid $117 million to the Fire Victim Trust from D&O
insurance policy proceeds. PG&E Corporation intends to apply the remaining proceeds to the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims.
As a result, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that it will incur a net loss of $145 million in connection with these matters. As of December 31, 2022,
the net loss is reflected in Other income (expense), net on PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
In the event that one or more of the settlements in these matters does not become effective, some or all parties are expected to continue to litigate, and at least
some of the amounts of PG&E Corporation’s expected liabilities will remain uncertain.
Wildfire-Related Derivative Litigation
Two purported derivative lawsuits alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court
on November 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respectively, naming as defendants certain then-current and former members of the boards of directors and
certain then-current and former officers of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility were named as nominal defendants. These
lawsuits were consolidated by the court on February 14, 2018 and denominated In Re California North Bay Fire Derivative Litigation (now re-captioned
Trotter v. Williams et al.). On April 13, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On January 28, 2019, this matter was automatically stayed by PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s rights with respect to PG&E Corporation’s and
the Utility’s claims, if any, directly or indirectly related to any of the Fires (as defined in the Plan) against former officers and directors of PG&E Corporation
and the Utility were assigned to the Fire Victim Trust under the Plan (the “Fire Victim Trust D&O Claims”). Any such recovery was limited to the extent of any
D&O Insurance policy proceeds paid by any insurance carrier on behalf of PG&E Corporation or the Utility for amounts owed pursuant to their
indemnification obligations in connection with such causes of action. On March 8, 2021, the court granted a stipulation by the parties to substitute the trustee
for the Fire Victim Trust as the plaintiff.
On December 24, 2018, a separate derivative lawsuit, entitled Bowlinger v. Chew, et al. (now captioned Trotter v. Chew, et al.), was filed in San Francisco
Superior Court, alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire
against certain then-current and former officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. On November 5, 2020, the
court entered a stipulation and order to substitute the trustee for the Fire Victim Trust as the plaintiff.
On February 24, 2021, the trustee filed an amended complaint in the Trotter v. Chew action, asserting two direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty against
certain of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s former directors and officers. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility was a party to the action. On March
30, 2021, the Trotter v. Chew and Trotter v. Williams actions were consolidated. On April 26, 2021, the defendants filed demurrers to the amended complaint,
which the court sustained in part and overruled in part on November 8, 2021. On November 18, 2021, the trustee filed a second amended complaint. On
December 21, 2021, the defendants filed demurrers to the second amended complaint, which the court overruled. On March 10, 2022, the defendants filed
motions for summary judgment.
170
On July 26, 2022, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, certain former director and officer defendants, and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the FVT D&O Claims
Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and certain former director and officer defendants paid $117 million to the Fire
Victim Trust from D&O Insurance policy proceeds, and in return, the Fire Victim Trust released, among other things, any claims related to the assigned claims
and the pursuit of the Trotter v. Chew action. Pursuant to the Plan, the settlement was paid solely from the insurance proceeds from the “Side B” D&O
Insurance coverage. As a result of the FVT D&O Claims Settlement Agreement, the Trotter v. Chew action was dismissed with prejudice on December 29,
2022.
On January 25, 2019, a separate purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Hagberg v. Chew, et al., was filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleging claims for
breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain then-current and
former officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. The plaintiff filed a request to dismiss this action, and on
October 12, 2022, the court dismissed the action.
Securities Class Action Litigation
Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action
In June 2018, two purported securities class actions were filed in the District Court, naming PG&E Corporation and certain of its then-current and former
officers as defendants, entitled David C. Weston v. PG&E Corporation, et al. and Jon Paul Moretti v. PG&E Corporation, et al., respectively. The complaints
alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in various PG&E Corporation public disclosures related to, among other things, vegetation management and
other issues connected to the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and other costs. Both complaints identified a proposed
class period of April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018. On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases, and the litigation is now denominated In re PG&E
Corporation Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 18-03509. The court also appointed PERA as lead
plaintiff. PERA filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018. On December 14, 2018, PERA filed a second amended consolidated complaint
to add allegations regarding the 2018 Camp fire, including allegations regarding transmission line safety and the PSPS program.
Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the proceedings were automatically stayed as to PG&E Corporation and the Utility.
On February 22, 2019, a third purported securities class action was filed in the District Court, entitled York County on behalf of the York County Retirement
Fund, et al. v. Rambo, et al. (the “York County Action”). The complaint named as defendants certain then-current and former officers and directors, as well as
the underwriters of four public offerings of notes from 2016 to 2018. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility was named as a defendant. The complaint
asserted claims under Section 11 of the Securities Act based on alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related
to, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s vegetation management and wildfire safety measures. On May 7, 2019, the York County Action
was consolidated with In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigation.
On May 28, 2019, the plaintiffs in the consolidated securities actions filed a third amended consolidated class action complaint, which includes the claims
asserted in the previously filed actions and names as defendants PG&E Corporation, the Utility, certain current and former officers and former directors, and
the underwriters. On August 28, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court denied PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s request to extend the stay to the claims against the
officer, director, and underwriter defendants. On October 4, 2019, the officer, director, and underwriter defendants filed motions to dismiss the third amended
complaint, which motions are under submission with the District Court. On September 30, 2022, the District Court issued an order staying the action pending
resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, the District Court administratively closed the case, subject to a motion by the parties thereto to reopen
the case. On October 31, 2022, PERA filed a notice of appeal of the District Court’s order staying the action. PERA’s opening brief for the appeal is due March
6, 2023, and the answering brief is due April 5, 2023.
171
Based on discussions with the plaintiffs in this matter, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that it will incur a loss in connection with this matter. In the
second quarter of 2022, PG&E Corporation recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $300 million (before available insurance), which represents its best
estimate of probable losses for the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims. PG&E Corporation believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could
be greater or less than the accrued estimated amount but is unable to reasonably estimate any additional loss because the amount of the liability has not been
agreed or otherwise determined, and even if PG&E Corporation were to enter into an agreement with representatives of the plaintiffs in this matter (which
would also resolve proofs of claim by these plaintiffs in the bankruptcy), any such agreement would be subject to, among other things, approval by the
Bankruptcy Court and the District Court, and class members would have the right to opt out of any such agreement.
Wildfire-Related Securities Claims—Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process
PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to resolve claims filed in the bankruptcy relating to, among others, the three purported securities class actions
(described above) that have been consolidated and denominated In re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Case No. 18-03509, pursuant to the Plan. As described above, these claims consist of pre-petition claims under the federal securities laws related to,
among other things, allegedly misleading statements or omissions with respect to vegetation management and wildfire safety disclosures, and are classified into
separate categories under the Plan, each of which is subject to subordination under the Bankruptcy Code. The first category of claims consists of pre-petition
claims arising from or related to the common stock of PG&E Corporation (such claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation, the
“HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims”). The second category of pre-petition claims, which comprises two separate classes under the Plan, consists of claims
arising from debt securities issued by PG&E Corporation and the Utility (such claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation and the
Utility, the “Subordinated Debt Claims,” and together with the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, the “Subordinated Claims”).
While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe they have defenses to the Subordinated Claims, as well as insurance coverage that may be available with
respect to the Subordinated Claims, these defenses may not prevail and any such insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the full amount of the
allowed claims. In that case, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be required, pursuant to the Plan, to satisfy any such allowed claims as follows:
•each holder of an allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claim will receive a number of shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation equal to such
holder’s HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claim Share (as such term is defined in the Plan); and
•each holder of an allowed Subordinated Debt Claim will receive payment in full in cash.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have engaged in settlement efforts with respect to the Subordinated Claims. If any of the Subordinated Claims are ultimately
not settled, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that those Subordinated Claims will be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court in the claims reconciliation
process and treated as described above under the Plan. Under the Plan, after the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have the authority to
compromise, settle, object to, or otherwise resolve proofs of claim, and the Bankruptcy Court retains jurisdiction to hear disputes arising in connection with
disputed claims. With respect to the Subordinated Claims, the claims reconciliation process may include litigation of the merits of such claims, including the
filing of motions, fact discovery, and expert discovery. The total number and amount of allowed Subordinated Claims, if any, was not determined at the
Emergence Date. To the extent any such claims are allowed, the total amount of such claims could be material, and therefore could result in (a) the issuance of
a material number of shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation with respect to allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, or (b) the payment of a
material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims. There can be no assurance that such claims will not have a material adverse impact
on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.
Further, if shares are issued in respect of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust
should receive additional shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation such that it would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of
reorganized PG&E Corporation on the Emergence Date, assuming that such issuance of shares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had
occurred on the Emergence Date.
172
On July 2, 2020, PERA filed a notice of appeal of the Confirmation Order to the District Court, solely to the extent of seeking review of that part of the
Confirmation Order approving the Insurance Deduction (as defined in the Plan) with respect to the formula for the determination of the HoldCo Rescission or
Damage Claims Share. On August 10, 2021, the District Court issued an order affirming the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling with respect to the Insurance Deduction.
On September 9, 2021, PERA filed a notice of appeal of the District Court’s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and on December
15, 2021, PERA filed its opening brief. On February 14, 2022 and February 17, 2022, the Official Committee of Tort Claimants appointed in the Chapter 11
Cases and both PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed their answering briefs, respectively. On May 20, 2022, the Official Committee of Tort Claimants filed a
motion to dismiss the case. On June 21, 2022, PERA filed its opposition, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility joined the motion to dismiss. On June 28,
2022, the Official Committee of Tort Claimants filed its reply. On January 13, 2023, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a joint motion with PERA
requesting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stay and hold PERA’s appeal in abeyance to allow the parties to continue to negotiate a settlement of the matters
underlying the appeal. On January 25, 2023, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals entered an order granting the joint motion. PERA’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals remains pending.
On September 1, 2020, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion (the “Securities Claims Procedures Motion”) with the Bankruptcy Court to approve
procedures to help facilitate the resolution of the Subordinated Claims. The motion, among other things, requested approval of procedures which would allow
PG&E Corporation and the Utility to collect trading information with respect to the Subordinated Claims, to engage in an alternative dispute resolution process
for resolving disputed Subordinated Claims, and to file certain omnibus claim objections with respect to the Subordinated Claims. On January 25, 2021, the
Bankruptcy Court granted the Securities Claims Procedures Motion.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have worked to resolve the Subordinated Claims in accordance with the procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court,
including by collecting trading information from holders of Subordinated Claims. Also, pursuant to those procedures, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have
filed numerous omnibus objections in the Bankruptcy Court to certain of the Subordinated Claims. The Bankruptcy Court has entered several orders
disallowing and expunging Subordinated Claims that were subject to these omnibus objections, and certain Subordinated Claims subject to these omnibus
objections remain pending. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to file additional omnibus objections with respect to certain of the Subordinated Claims
and to continue to act under the procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court to resolve the Subordinated Claims.
Indemnification Obligations and D&O Insurance Coverage
To the extent permitted by law, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have obligations to indemnify directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while a
director or officer is or was serving in such capacity, which indemnification obligations may extend to the claims asserted against certain directors and officers
in the securities class actions and in the litigation matters enumerated above under the heading “Wildfire-Related Derivative Litigation.” PG&E Corporation
and the Utility maintain D&O Insurance coverage to reduce their exposure to such indemnification obligations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have
provided notice to their insurance carriers of the claims asserted in the litigation matters enumerated above under the headings “Wildfire-Related Securities
Class Action” and “Wildfire-Related Derivative Litigation,” and are in arbitration with certain carriers regarding, among other things, the applicability of one
year of D&O Insurance policies to those matters (the “Insurance Coverage Claims”).
In July 2022, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the former director and officer defendants settled the majority of the Insurance Coverage Claims with certain
of their D&O Insurance carriers. As a result of these agreements, PG&E Corporation received insurance proceeds in an aggregate amount of $272 million.
Proceeds from the D&O Insurance coverage were paid to the Fire Victim Trust for the Fire Victim Trust D&O Claims, and PG&E Corporation intends to apply
the remaining proceeds to the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility additionally have potential indemnification obligations to the underwriters for the Utility’s note offerings, pursuant to the
underwriting agreements associated with those offerings. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s indemnification obligations to the officers, directors and
underwriters may be limited or affected by the Chapter 11 Cases, among other things.
Butte County District Attorney’s Office Investigation into the 2018 Camp Fire
Following the 2018 Camp fire, the Butte County District Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office opened a criminal investigation of the
2018 Camp fire.
173
On March 17, 2020, the Utility entered into the Plea Agreement and Settlement (the “Plea Agreement”) with the People of the State of California, by and
through the Butte County District Attorney’s Office to resolve the criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2018 Camp fire. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Plea Agreement, the Utility pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in violation of Penal Code section 192(b) and
one count of unlawfully causing a fire in violation of Penal Code section 452, and to admit special allegations pursuant to Penal Code sections 452.1(a)(2),
452.1(a)(3) and 452.1(a)(4).
On August 20, 2021, the Butte County Superior Court held a brief hearing on the status of restitution, which involves distribution of funds from the Fire Victim
Trust. The Butte County Superior Court has since continued the hearing to May 19, 2023.
NOTE 16: OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigation
matters and environmental remediation.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the
lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or
reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies
are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments,
rulings, penalties related to regulatory compliance, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E
Corporation and the Utility exclude anticipated legal costs from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred. The Utility also has substantial
financial commitments in connection with agreements entered into to support its operating activities.  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of the following
matters.
CPUC and FERC Matters
Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund
The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in
rates in the TO rate case. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before
the FERC has issued a final decision. The Utility bills and records revenue based on the amounts requested in its rate case filing and records a reserve for its
estimate of the amounts that are probable of refund. Rates subject to refund went into effect on March 1, 2017, March 1, 2018, and May 1, 2019 for the TO rate
case for 2017 (“TO18”), the TO rate case for 2018 (“TO19”), and the TO rate case for 2019 (“TO20”), respectively.
On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required the
allocation of all common plant between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be based on operating and maintenance labor ratios. The order reopened the record for
the limited purpose of allowing the parties an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodology adopted in FERC
Opinion No. 569-A, issued on May 21, 2020.
On December 17, 2020 and June 17, 2021, the FERC issued orders denying requests for rehearing submitted by the Utility and intervenors. In 2021, the Utility
filed four appeals. The appeals related to two issues: (i) impact of the Tax Act on TO18 rates in January and February 2018 and (ii) aspects of the rehearing
order other than the Tax Act. The appeals have been consolidated and are being held in abeyance until the FERC addresses the ROE issue on rehearing.
As a result of an order denying rehearing on the common plant allocation, the Utility increased its regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during
the TO18, TO19, and TO20 rate case periods from 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2022 by approximately $416 million. A portion of these common plant
costs are expected to be recovered at the CPUC in a separate application and as a result, the Utility recorded approximately $258 million to Regulatory assets.
On September 21, 2018, the Utility filed an all-party settlement with the FERC, which was approved by the FERC on December 20, 2018, in connection with
TO19. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon
issuance of a final unappealable decision in the TO18 proceeding.

On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved an all-party settlement agreement in connection with TO20. The TO20 settlement resolved all issues of the
Utility’s formula rate. However, some of the formula rate issues are contingent on the outcome of TO18, including the allocation of costs related to common,
general and intangible plant. The settlement provides that the formula rate will remain in effect through December 31, 2023. The TO20 rate case provides that
the transmission revenue requirement and rates are to be updated annually on January 1, subject to true-up. The Utility is required to make a successor rate
filing in 2023, which would go into effect on January 1, 2024.
Under its formula rate, the Utility submits an annual update to the FERC each December for rates to go into effect on January 1 of the following year. Parties
have protested the Utility’s annual updates, and these protests are pending before the FERC.
On March 17, 2022, the FERC issued a further order in the TO18 rate case proceeding finding that 9.26% is the just and reasonable base ROE for the Utility.
With the incentive component of 50-basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO, the resulting ROE would be 9.76%. As a result, the
Utility increased its regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during the TO18 and TO19 rate case periods from March 2017 through the first
quarter of 2022 by approximately $62.5 million. On April 18, 2022, the Utility and several other parties sought rehearing of the FERC’s determination of the
base ROE finding. On May 19, 2022, the FERC denied all parties’ rehearing requests. The Utility has filed an appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, as
have the other parties that sought rehearing. The appeal is being held in abeyance until the FERC issues a substantive order on rehearing on the ROE issue.
On May 16, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the Utility filed a compliance filing and a refund report describing the adjustments made to the transmission revenue
requirement, adjusted rates, and the calculation and mechanism of the refunds. The Utility expects to issue the refund after the FERC issues a decision on the
compliance filing.
2022 Cost of Capital Application
The Utility’s annual cost of capital adjustment mechanism provides that in any year in which the difference between (i) the average Moody’s utility bond rates
(as measured in the 12-month period from October through September (the “Index”)) and (ii) 4.5% exceeds 100 basis points, the Utility’s ROE will be adjusted
by one-half of such difference, and the cost of debt will be trued up to the most recent recorded cost of debt. The Utility is to initiate this adjustment mechanism
by filing an advice letter on or before October 15 of the year in which the mechanism triggered, to become effective on January 1 of the next year.
On August 23, 2021, the Utility filed an off-cycle 2022 cost of capital application with the CPUC based on the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic
and related government response, which has decreased interest rates but has not reduced the cost of capital for electric utilities in general, and the Utility in
particular, to the same extent as the overall financial markets (the “2022 cost of capital application”). The 2022 cost of capital application requested that the
CPUC authorize the Utility's cost of capital for its electric generation, electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage
rate base beginning on January 1, 2022 for 2022, 2023, and 2024. The Utility requested that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposed ratemaking capital
structure, ROE, cost of preferred stock, and cost of debt. The Utility proposed to establish a cost of long-term debt of 4.14%, a return on preferred stock of
5.52%, a ROE of 11%, and to retain the existing capital structure.
In September 2021, the cost of capital adjustment mechanism was triggered because the Index was 117 basis points below the benchmark. As the 2022 cost of
capital application was pending, the Utility did not file the October 15, 2021 advice letter to adjust rates. Subsequently, on October 28, 2021, the CPUC ruled
that the 2022 cost of capital application did not suspend the adjustment mechanism as requested by the application. The ruling also required that the Utility
comply with the cost of capital mechanism by filing the information that would have been included in the October 15, 2021 advice letter in the 2022 cost of
capital application proceeding on November 8, 2021, which the Utility did.
On December 17, 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision authorizing the Utility’s request to establish memorandum accounts to track revenue requirement
changes beginning on January 1, 2022 and leaving the cost of capital rates at current levels, subject to true-up based on the CPUC’s decision on the 2022 cost
of capital application. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility had not recorded a reserve for refunds related to these memorandum accounts.
On November 3, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision finding that an extraordinary event occurred, and that the cost of capital adjustment mechanism should
not be implemented for 2022. The final decision retains the cost of capital previously authorized in the 2020 cost of capital proceeding, as adjusted, and closes
this proceeding. On December 5, 2022, intervenors filed an application for rehearing. On December 20, 2022, the Utility filed a response to the application for
rehearing.
175
Other Matters
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various claims and lawsuits that separately are not considered material.  Accruals for contingencies related to
such matters totaled $69 million and $77 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. These amounts were included in Other current
liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these
matters will have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
PSPS Class Action
On December 19, 2019, a complaint was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California naming PG&E Corporation and the
Utility. The plaintiff seeks certification of a class consisting of all California residents and business owners who had their power shut off by the Utility during
the October 9, October 23, October 26, October 28, or November 20, 2019 power outages and any subsequent voluntary outages occurring during the course of
litigation. The plaintiff alleges that the necessity for the October and November 2019 power shutoff events was caused by the Utility’s negligence in failing to
properly maintain its electrical lines and surrounding vegetation. The complaint seeks up to $2.5 billion in special and general damages, punitive and
exemplary damages and injunctive relief to require the Utility to properly maintain and inspect its power grid. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe the
allegations are without merit and intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously.
On March 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court granted a motion to dismiss this class action by the Utility because the plaintiff’s class action claims are preempted
as a matter of law by the California Public Utilities Code. On April 3, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order dismissing the action without leave to
amend.
The plaintiff appealed the decision dismissing the complaint to the District Court. On March 26, 2021, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s
dismissal of this action, and the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 28, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals entered an order certifying two questions of state law to the California Supreme Court. On June 1, 2022, the California Supreme Court accepted
certification of the questions. The plaintiff filed its opening brief on July 1, 2022. The Utility’s answering brief was filed on August 31, 2022, and the plaintiff’s
reply brief was filed on October 20, 2022.
The Utility is unable to determine the timing and outcome of this proceeding.
CZU Lightning Complex Fire Notices of Violation
Between November 2020 and January 2021, several governmental entities raised concerns regarding the Utility’s emergency response to the 2020 CZU
Lightning Complex fire, including Cal Fire, the California Coastal Commission, the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, and Santa Cruz
County Board of Supervisors alleging environmental, vegetation management, and unpermitted work violations. In the matter of Santa Cruz County’s
complaint with the CPUC, the parties reached a settlement, and the CPUC dismissed the complaint on December 15, 2021. The Utility continues to work with
the California Coastal Commission, Cal Fire, and the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board to resolve any outstanding issues and to work with
Santa Cruz County to implement the terms of the settlement agreement. Violations can result in penalties, remediation, and other relief.
Based on the information available, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Accordingly, PG&E Corporation
and the Utility recorded charges during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022, each for an amount that is not material. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not
believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
176
Environmental Remediation Contingencies
Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process
for estimating remediation liabilities requires significant judgment. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments
indicate that remediation is probable, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts. The Utility records an environmental
remediation liability based on the lower end of the range of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other
amount. Key factors that inform the development of estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions,
operations and maintenance activities, post-remediation monitoring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.
Amounts recorded are not discounted to their present value. The Utility’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is comprised of the following:
 Balance at
(in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021
Topock natural gas compressor station $ 284 $ 299 
Hinkley natural gas compressor station 110 123 
Former MGP sites owned by the Utility or third parties 750 667 
Utility-owned generation facilities (other than fossil fuel-fired), other facilities, and third-party
disposal sites 112 104 
Fossil fuel-fired generation facilities and sites 26 70 
Total environmental remediation liability $ 1,282 $ 1,263 
Primarily driven by the following sites: San Francisco Beach Street, Vallejo, Napa, and San Francisco East Harbor.
Primarily driven by geothermal landfill and Shell Pond site.
 Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant.
The Utility’s gas compressor stations, former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, and
disposal of potentially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act in addition to other state laws relating to hazardous substances.  The Utility has a comprehensive program to comply with
federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility
assesses and monitors the environmental requirements on an ongoing basis and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate. The Utility’s
remediation activities are overseen by the DTSC, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.
The Utility’s environmental remediation liability as of December 31, 2022, reflects its best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the
current assessment data and regulatory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final
remediation plans, the Utility’s time frame for remediation, and unanticipated claims filed against the Utility.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future
that are materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows during
the period in which they are recorded. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility expected to recover $1.05 billion of its environmental remediation liability for
certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by the CPUC. 
Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites
The Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas
compressor stations. The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.(1)

177
Topock Site
The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the DTSC and the U.S. Department of the Interior.
On April 24, 2018, the DTSC authorized the Utility to build an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic and non-
soluble form of chromium. Construction activities began in October 2018, and the initial phase of construction was completed in 2021. Additional phases of
construction will continue for several years. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Topock site may increase by as much as $240 million if
the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Topock site are
expected to be recovered primarily through the HSMA, where 90% of the costs are recovered through rates.
Hinkley Site
The Utility has been implementing remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and
control movement of the plume. The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region. In November 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted
a clean-up and abatement order directing the Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental
impacts. The final order states that the Utility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other
action. Additionally, the final order sets plume capture requirements, requires a monitoring and reporting program, and includes deadlines for the Utility to
meet interim cleanup targets. The United States Geological Survey team is conducting a background study on the site to better define the chromium plume
boundaries. A draft background report was received in January 2020 and is expected to be finalized in 2023. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated
with the Hinkley site may increase by as much as $126 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs
associated with environmental remediation at the Hinkley site will not be recovered through rates.
Former Manufactured Gas Plants
Former MGPs used coal and oil to produce gas for use by the Utility’s customers before natural gas became available. The by-products and residues of this
process were often disposed of at the MGPs themselves. The Utility has a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process;
many of the sites in the program have been addressed. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $511
million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation at identified MGP sites is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental
remediation at the MGP sites are recovered through the HSMA, where 90% of the costs are recovered through rates.
Utility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Party Disposal Sites
Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with
Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $51 million if the extent of contamination or necessary
remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal
sites are recovered through the HSMA, where 90% of the costs are recovered through rates.
Fossil Fuel-Fired Generation Sites
In 1998, the Utility divested its generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, the
Utility retained the environmental remediation liability associated with each site. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired
generation sites may increase by as much as $50 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental
remediation costs associated with the fossil fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.
Nuclear Insurance
The Utility maintains multiple insurance policies through NEIL, a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities, and EMANI, covering nuclear or
non-nuclear events at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired Humboldt Bay Unit 3.  
178
NEIL provides insurance coverage for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur
at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon. NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $3.2 billion per
nuclear incident and $2.5 billion per non-nuclear incident for Diablo Canyon. For Humboldt Bay Unit 3, NEIL provides up to $50 million of coverage for
nuclear and non-nuclear property damages.
NEIL provides coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants. Through NEIL, there is up to $3.2 billion available to the
membership to cover one or more terrorist acts occurring within a 12-month period at member sites. NEIL also provides coverage for damages caused by cyber
events at nuclear power plants. Through NEIL, there is up to $3.2 billion available to the membership to cover one or more cyber events occurring within a 12-
month period at member sites. These coverage amounts are shared by all NEIL members and all nuclear and non-nuclear property insurance policies issued by
NEIL.
In addition to the nuclear insurance the Utility maintains through NEIL, the Utility also is a member of EMANI. EMANI shares losses with NEIL as part of the
first $400 million in coverage for nuclear or non-nuclear property damages. Additional coverage is procured through EMANI, which provides excess insurance
coverage for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon. The
excess insurance coverage through EMANI provides an additional $200 million for any one accident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined
amount recoverable under the Utility’s NEIL policies. The coverage procured through EMANI also includes protection for acts of terrorism.
If NEIL losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this
assessment, the maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $41 million.  If EMANI losses in any
policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $4 million. 
Under the Price-Anderson Act, public liability claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation of
material to and from Diablo Canyon are limited to approximately $13.7 billion. The Utility purchases the maximum available public liability insurance of
$450 million for Diablo Canyon. The balance of the $13.7 billion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among nuclear reactor
owners. The Utility may be assessed up to $275 million per nuclear incident under this loss sharing program, with payments in each year limited to a maximum
of $41 million per incident. Both the maximum assessment and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.
The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher
to a fuel fabricator or that occur at the fuel fabricator’s facility. The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these
incidents up to a maximum of $450 million per incident. In addition, the Utility has approximately $53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3
and has a $500 million indemnification from the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents for Humboldt Bay Unit 3, covering liabilities in excess
of the $53 million in liability insurance.
Purchase Commitments
The following table shows the undiscounted future expected obligations under power purchase agreements that have been approved by the CPUC and have met
specified construction milestones as well as undiscounted future expected payment obligations for natural gas supplies, natural gas transportation, natural gas
storage, and nuclear fuel as of December 31, 2022:

Third-Party Power Purchase Agreements
In the ordinary course of business, the Utility enters into various agreements, including renewable energy agreements, QF agreements, and other power
purchase agreements to purchase power and electric capacity.  The price of purchased power may be fixed or variable.  Variable pricing is generally based on
the current market price of either natural gas or electricity at the date of delivery.
Renewable Energy Power Purchase Agreements.  In order to comply with California’s RPS requirements, the Utility is required to deliver renewable energy to
its customers at a gradually increasing rate.  The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase renewable energy to help meet California’s
requirement. The Utility’s obligations under a significant portion of these agreements are contingent on the third party’s construction of new generation
facilities, which are expected to grow.  These renewable energy contracts expire at various dates between 2023 and 2043.
Conventional Energy Power Purchase Agreements.  The Utility has entered into many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources,
which include tolling agreements and RA agreements.  The Utility’s obligations under a portion of these agreements are contingent on the third parties’
development of new generation facilities to provide capacity and energy products to the Utility. These power purchase agreements expire at various dates
between 2023 and 2041.
Other Power Purchase Agreements.  The Utility has entered into agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that own
generation facilities that meet the definition of a QF under federal law. As of December 31, 2022, QF contracts in operation expire at various dates between
2023 and 2041.  In addition, the Utility has agreements with various irrigation districts and water agencies to purchase hydroelectric power.
The net costs incurred for all power purchases and electric capacity were $2.8 billion in 2022, $3.0 billion in 2021, and $2.9 billion in 2020.
Natural Gas Supply, Transportation, and Storage Commitments 
The Utility purchases natural gas directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States to serve its core customers and to fuel its owned-
generation facilities.  The Utility also contracts for natural gas transportation from the points at which the Utility takes delivery (typically in Canada, the United
States Rocky Mountain supply area, and the southwestern United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These
agreements expire at various dates between 2023 and 2041.  In addition, the Utility has contracted for natural gas storage services in Northern California to
more reliably meet customers’ loads.
Costs incurred for natural gas purchases, natural gas transportation services, and natural gas storage, which include contracts with terms of less than 1 year,
were $2.4 billion in 2022, $1.2 billion in 2021, and $0.8 billion in 2020.
Nuclear Fuel Agreements
The Utility has entered into several purchase agreements for nuclear fuel.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2023 and 2024 and are intended to
ensure long-term nuclear fuel supply.  The Utility relies on a number of international producers of nuclear fuel in order to diversify its sources and provide
security of supply.  Pricing terms are also diversified, ranging from market-based prices to base prices that are escalated using published indices. 
Payments for nuclear fuel were $44 million in 2022, $79 million in 2021, and $111 million in 2020.
180
Other Commitments
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have other commitments primarily related to office facilities and land leases, which expire at various dates between 2023
and 2057.  At December 31, 2022, the future minimum payments related to these commitments were as follows:

Total minimum lease payments $ 3,935 
Payments for other commitments were $63 million in 2022, $50 million in 2021, and $45 million in 2020.  Certain office facility leases contain escalation
clauses requiring annual increases in rent.  The rents may increase by a fixed amount each year, a percentage of the base rent, or the consumer price index. 
There are options to extend these leases for one to five years.
In addition to the commitments in the table above, pursuant to SB 901, a shareholder contribution to the customer credit trust of $1.0 billion is to be made in
2024.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment and
those criteria, management has concluded that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
181
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2022, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively, referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP).
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on
the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Regulation and Regulated Operations—Refer to Notes 3, 4 and 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (the “Utility”), follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from
customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) or the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) based on its cost of providing service. The Utility records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking
process that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for nonregulated entities. The
Utility capitalizes and records, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered
in future rates and records regulatory liabilities for amounts that are likely to be refunded to customers. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts
multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.
182
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the significant degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in
current or future rates due in part to the uncertainty related to future decisions by the rate regulators, as well as likelihood of refunds to customers. This required
specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and a significant degree of auditor
judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s conclusions that the costs approved by a CPUC or FERC decision
for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset or likely refund as a regulatory liability under GAAP and are recorded at the appropriate amount.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation related to the uncertainty of future
decisions by the rate regulators and costs approved by a CPUC or FERC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset or regulatory
liability and are recorded at the appropriate amount included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the evaluation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets;
and (b) regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates; (2) management’s
determination that costs approved by a CPUC or FERC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset or regulatory liability
and are recorded at the appropriate amount; and (3) the review of disclosures related to these matters.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the CPUC and FERC for the Utility and other public utilities in California, procedural filings, filings
made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the CPUC’s
and FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded
regulatory asset balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process (e.g., applications for cost recovery), we inspected the Utility’s filings with the CPUC and FERC and the filings with
the CPUC and FERC by intervenors that may impact the Utility’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.
•For regulatory assets approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes, we selected samples of costs and evaluated whether they met the definition
of a regulatory asset by comparing the costs to the description of the costs approved by a CPUC decision and were recorded at the appropriate amount.
For regulatory liabilities, we selected samples of regulatory liabilities and evaluated whether the Company met the definition of a refund or a future
reduction in rates.
•We evaluated whether the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory
developments, were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.
Wildfire-Related Contingencies and Recoveries—Refer to Note 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company has recorded provisions for loss contingencies related to the 2019 Kincade fire, 2020 Zogg fire, 2021 Dixie fire, and 2022 Mosquito fire. The
Company has recorded estimated probable losses of $1,025 million, $400 million, $1,175 million, and $100 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022,
which represents the lower end of the range of reasonably possible losses in connection with each of the fires. The Company has recorded estimated recoveries
of wildfire-related contingencies, including $439 million and $175 million, in the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account (“WEMA”) and Wildfire Fund,
respectively, as of December 31, 2022.
We identified wildfire-related contingencies and related-recoveries, specifically the WEMA and Wildfire Fund, as well as the related disclosures as a critical
audit matter because (1) of the significant judgments made by management to estimate losses, (2) the outcome of the wildfire-related contingencies materially
affects the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows and (3) the significant judgments made by management in determining whether
recoveries from WEMA and the Wildfire Fund are probable. This required the application of a significant degree of auditor judgment and audit effort when
performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimated losses, related recoveries, and disclosures.
183
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s judgments regarding its estimated losses for wildfire-related contingencies, related recoveries, and disclosures
included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the Company’s determination of whether a loss was probable and/or reasonably possible and whether
recoveries were probable; (2) the determination of the significant assumptions used in estimating the amount of probable loss, if any, including the
information gained through investigations into the cause of the fire, information from claimants, and the advice of legal counsel that may impact the
valuation of the liability; and (3) the disclosures related to the wildfires.
•We evaluated management’s judgments related to whether a loss was probable and/or reasonably possible for the wildfires and whether recoveries are
probable, by inquiring of management and the Company’s legal counsel regarding the amount of probable and/or reasonably possible losses for each
fire and each related recovery, including the potential impact of information gained through investigations into the cause of each fire, information from
claimants, communication with insurers, the advice of legal counsel, and reading external information for any evidence that might contradict
management’s assertions.
•We obtained an analysis from management and external legal counsel for recoveries specific to WEMA, regarding probability of recovery for deferred
costs not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery. We evaluated the Company’s
conclusions regarding probability of recoverability of WEMA and from the Wildfire Fund, under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
•We evaluated the estimation methodology for determining the amount of probable loss through inquiries with management; we tested the significant
assumptions used in the valuation of the liability. With the assistance of our real estate valuation specialists, we assessed the appropriateness of the
data sources utilized to determine the assumption utilized in management’s estimate.
•We read the legal letters from the Company’s external and internal legal counsel regarding known information and evaluated whether the information
therein was consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.
•We evaluated whether the Company’s disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.
SB 901 Securitization—Refer to Note 6 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, authorized the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds
(also referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California
wildfires, any amounts in excess of the customer harm threshold (CHT) as defined in SB 901. The CPUC authorized the Utility to establish a customer credit
trust funded by the Company’s shareholders that will provide a monthly credit to customers that is anticipated to equal the fixed recovery charges such that the
securitization is designed to be rate neutral to customers. The Company’s subsidiary, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, securitized $7.5 billion of 2017
wildfire claims costs through the issuance of recovery bonds that is designed to be rate-neutral to its customers. Pursuant to the financing order, the Utility sold
its right to receive revenues from the non-bypassable fixed recovery charge (“SB 901 Recovery Property”) to PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, which,
in turn, issued the recovery bonds secured by the SB 901 Recovery Property. The fixed recovery charge is designed to recover the full principal amount of the
recovery bonds along with any associated interest and financing costs. In the context of the CHT decision, which is intended to insulate customers from the
fixed recovery charge, there is a customer credit which is designed to equal the recovery bond principal, interest, and financing costs over the life of the
recovery bonds. The customer credit is funded by the customer credit trust. The fixed recovery charges and customer credits are presented on a net basis in
Operating Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income and had no net impact on Operating Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.
184
Also pursuant to the CHT decision, the Utility recorded a SB 901 securitization regulatory asset in the amount of $5.5 billion, reflecting PG&E Wildfire
Recovery Funding LLC’s right to recover $7.5 billion in wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires, partially offset by the
$2.0 billion in required upfront shareholder contributions to the customer credit trust. The Utility also recorded a SB 901 securitization regulatory liability
which represents certain shareholder tax benefits the Utility has recognized that will be returned to customers. As the Fire Victim Trust sells the remaining
shares it holds of PG&E Corporation common stock, the SB 901 securitization regulatory liability will increase, reflecting the recognition of additional income
tax benefits, up to $7.59 billion as required in the CHT decision. As these tax benefits are monetized, they will be contributed to the customer credit trust. The
Utility expects to amortize the SB 901 securitization regulatory asset and liability over the life of the recovery bonds, with such amortization expense reflected
within Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2022, the Utility had SB 901 securitization regulatory
assets of $5.5 billion and SB 901 securitization regulatory liabilities of $6.1 billion, with SB 901 securitization charges, net recorded on the Consolidated
Statement of Income of $608 million.
We identified the accounting for the SB 901 securitization as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in the application of
the relevant GAAP. This required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation required significant audit effort when performing audit procedures to
evaluate the accounting treatment associated with the transaction.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the application of accounting guidance for the SB 901 securitization included the following:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the accounting treatment for the SB 901 securitization and disclosures related to the
securitization.
•With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in accounting for rate regulation, we evaluated the conclusions regarding the
regulatory asset, regulatory liability, expense and tax accounting treatment applied to the SB 901 securitization by performing the following:
◦Read the terms and conditions included in the financing order, as well as correspondence with the CPUC regarding the intent of the
securitization.
◦Evaluated the conclusions regarding the GAAP applied to account for the transaction.
•We evaluated whether the Company’s disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.
Wildfire Fund—Refer to Notes 3 and 14 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
On July 12, 2019, the California Governor signed into law Assembly Bill (“AB”) 1054, a bill which provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will
be available for eligible electric utility companies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the
applicable electric utility company’s equipment. The Company accounts for the contributions to the Wildfire Fund by capitalizing an asset, amortizing to
periods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage, and incrementally adjusting for accelerated amortization as the level of coverage declines. As of
December 31, 2022, the Wildfire Fund asset is $5.3 billion and the related amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2022 is $477 million.
AB 1054 did not specify a period of coverage; therefore the Company estimated the useful life of 15 years using a Monte Carlo simulation.
We identified the Company’s accounting for the Wildfire Fund asset as a critical audit matter due to significant judgments made by management to determine
the useful life, specifically the updated assumption related to the effectiveness of wildfire mitigation efforts. This required the application of a high degree of
auditor judgment, extensive audit effort, and the need to involve actuarial specialists when performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company’s accounting
and disclosure related to the Wildfire Fund.
185
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Wildfire Fund included the following:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the Company’s review of the key assumptions to the useful life estimate, specifically the update
assumption related to the effectiveness of wildfire mitigation efforts, (2) review of the Monte Carlo simulation methodology used to develop useful
life estimate and (3) the disclosures related to the Wildfire Fund asset and the key assumptions to the useful life estimate, specifically the update
assumption related to the effectiveness of wildfire mitigation efforts and the period of historic fire-loss data.
•With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used to determine the Wildfire Fund asset useful
life. This evaluation of the modeling methodology included a detailed assessment of the Monte Carlo simulation.
•We evaluated each of management’s key assumptions to the useful life estimate and judgments made by management, including those related to the
effectiveness of wildfire mitigation efforts, by inquiring of management, comparing the assumptions to relevant source data, performing sensitivity
analyses including information filed with the Company’s regulator related to wildfire mitigation efforts and other publicly available data. Additionally,
we inspected relevant source data for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.
•We evaluated whether the disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Pacific Gas and Electric Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and subsidiaries (the “Utility”) as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively, referred to as the “financial statements”). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Utility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Utility’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the
Utility’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Utility’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Utility’s financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Utility in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on
the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Regulation and Regulated Operations—Refer to Notes 3, 4, and 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Utility follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been
authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) based on its cost of
providing service. The Utility records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for nonregulated entities. The Utility capitalizes and records, as regulatory assets,
costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates and records regulatory liabilities for
amounts that are likely to be refunded to customers. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and
disclosures.
187
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the significant degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in
current or future rates due in part to the uncertainty related to future decisions by the rate regulators, as well as likelihood of refunds to customers. This required
specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and a significant degree of auditor
judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s conclusions that the costs approved by a CPUC or FERC decision
for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset or likely refund as a regulatory liability under GAAP and are recorded at the appropriate amount.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation related to the uncertainty of future
decisions by the rate regulators and costs approved by a CPUC or FERC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset or regulatory
liability and are recorded at the appropriate amount included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the evaluation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets
and (b) regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates; (2) management’s
determination that costs approved by a CPUC or FERC decision for tracking purposes meet the definition of a regulatory asset or regulatory liability
and are recorded at the appropriate amount; and (3) the review of disclosures related to these matters.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the CPUC and FERC for the Utility and other public utilities in California, procedural filings, filings
made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the CPUC’s
and FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded
regulatory asset balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process (e.g., applications for cost recovery), we inspected the Utility’s filings with the CPUC and FERC and the filings with
the CPUC and FERC by intervenors that may impact the Utility’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.
•For regulatory assets approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes, we selected samples of costs and evaluated whether they met the definition
of a regulatory asset by comparing the costs to the description of the costs approved by a CPUC decision and were recorded at the appropriate amount.
For regulatory liabilities, we selected samples of regulatory liabilities and evaluated whether the Utility met the definition of a refund or a future
reduction in rates.
•We evaluated whether the Utility’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments,
were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.
Wildfire-Related Contingencies and Recoveries—Refer to Note 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Utility has recorded provisions for loss contingencies related to the 2019 Kincade fire, 2020 Zogg fire, 2021 Dixie fire and 2022 Mosquito fire. The Utility
has recorded estimated probable losses of $1,025 million,$400 million, $1,175 million, and $100 million, respectively as of December 31, 2022, which
represents the lower end of the range of reasonably possible losses in connection with each of the fires. The Utility has recorded estimated recoveries of
wildfire ‐ related contingencies, including $439 million and $175 million, in the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account (“WEMA”) and Wildfire Fund,

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and subsidiaries (the “Utility”) as of December 31, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Utility maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Utility and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Utility’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Utility in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CONFORMED VERSION OF
AMENDED AND RESTATED
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
OF
PG&E CORPORATION
(as amended)
    On June 22, 2020, PG&E Corporation (the “Corporation”) filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of
California. On May 24, 2022, PG&E Corporation filed a Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of
California.
    FIRST: The name of the Corporation shall be
PG&E CORPORATION
    SECOND: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of California other than the banking business, the trust company business or the practice of a profession permitted to be incorporated by the
California Corporations Code.
THIRD:
I.    The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) shall consist of such number of directors, not fewer than twelve (12)
nor more than fifteen (15), as shall be fixed from time to time by the Board; provided that from and after the effective date of these Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation until December 31, 2020, such minimum number of directors shall be nine (9).
II.    The Board by a vote of two-thirds of the whole Board may appoint from the directors an Executive Committee, which
Committee may exercise such powers as may lawfully be conferred upon it by the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, that the powers of the Executive
Committee may not supersede the powers and responsibilities delegated to the Safety and Nuclear Oversight Committee in accordance with the charter of the
Safety and Nuclear Oversight Committee. The Executive Committee may prescribe rules for its own government and its meetings may be held at such places
within or without California as said Committee may determine or authorize.
    FOURTH: No shareholder may cumulate votes in the election of directors.
    FIFTH: The liability of the directors of the Corporation for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under California law.
    SIXTH: The Corporation is authorized to provide indemnification of agents (as defined in Section 317 of the California Corporations Code) through bylaws,
resolutions, agreements with agents, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification otherwise permitted by
Section 317 of the California Corporations Code, subject only to the applicable limits set forth in Section 204 of the California Corporations Code.
SEVENTH:
I.    The Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of shares, to be designated respectively Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”)
and Common Stock (“Common Stock”). The total number of shares of capital stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is 4,000,000,000, of which
400,000,000 shall be Preferred Stock and 3,600,000,000 shall be Common Stock. The Corporation shall not issue nonvoting equity securities (as such term is
defined in Section 101(16) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Bankruptcy Code”)) to the extent prohibited by Section 1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code
for so long as such Section 1123(a)(6) is in effect and applicable to the Corporation.
II.    The Preferred Stock may be issued in any number of series, as determined by the Board. The Board may by resolution fix the
designation and number of shares of any such series and, subject to Section I of Article Seventh, may determine, alter, or revoke the rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions
1
[[DMS:5334890v17:5/21/2020 12:29:33 AM
pertaining to any wholly unissued class or series of shares. The Board may thereafter in the same manner increase or decrease the number of shares of any such
series (but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding). If the number of shares of any such series shall be so decreased, the shares
constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.
EIGHTH:
The Board, when evaluating any proposal or offer which would involve (i) a merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries with another person, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) a tender offer or exchange
offer for any capital stock of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or (iv) any similar transaction, shall give due consideration to all factors they may
consider relevant. Such factors may include, without limitation, (a) the adequacy, both in amount and form, of the consideration offered in relation not only to
the current market price of the Corporation’s outstanding securities, but also the current value of the Corporation in a freely negotiated transaction with other
potential acquirers and the Board’s estimate of the Corporation’s future value (including the unrealized value of its properties, assets and prospects) as an
independent going concern, (b) the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the acquirer, and (c) the legal, economic, environmental,
regulatory and social effects of the proposed transaction on the Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ employees, customers, suppliers and other affected persons
and entities and on the communities and geographic areas in which the Corporation and its subsidiaries operate, provide utility service or are located, and in
particular, the effect on the Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to safely and reliably meet any public utility obligations they may have at reasonable
rates.
NINTH:
            Restrictions on Transfer of Securities. To ensure the preservation of certain tax attributes for the benefit of the Corporation and its shareholders,

“Acquiring Group” means any group of Persons where one or more Persons in such group acquires or seeks to acquire beneficial ownership
of Corporation Securities and one or more other Persons in such group acquires or seeks to acquire beneficial ownership of Company Group Securities

ownership and attribution rules of the regulations); provided, that (1) if any Person is a member of an Acquiring Group, such Person’s Percentage
Stock Ownership in the Corporation shall take into account any ownership of additional shares of stock treated as issued by the Corporation under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-92 as a result of the Acquiring Group’s planned or actual acquisition of the Company Group Securities (applying
such sections with reference to the Corporation as the common parent, including under
2
supplemental rules for determining an ownership change and treating the Corporation as having “actual knowledge” of all plans and acquisitions of
Company Group Securities for purposes of applying Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-92(c)(2)(iii)), (2) for purposes of applying Treasury
Regulation Section 1.382-2T(k)(2), the Corporation shall be treated as having “actual knowledge” of the beneficial ownership of all outstanding
Company Group Securities that would be attributed to any individual or entity, and (3) for the sole purpose of determining the Percentage Stock
Ownership of any Person that is an entity (and not for the purpose of determining the Percentage Stock Ownership of any other Person), Company
Group Securities held by such Person shall not be treated as no longer owned by such Person pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T(h)(2)
(i)(A).
“Person” means any individual, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, firm, corporation, unincorporated association or
organization, trust or other entity, provided, that, for all purposes of this Article Ninth, any group of such “Persons” having a formal or informal
understanding among themselves to make a “coordinated acquisition” of shares within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3(a)(1) or
who are otherwise treated as an “entity” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3(a)(1) shall be treated as an “entity,” and
references to any entity shall include any successor (by merger or otherwise) of any such entity.
“Prohibited Distributions” means any dividends or other distributions that were received by the Purported Transferee from the Corporation
with respect to the Excess Securities received by a Purported Transferee.
“Prohibited Transfer” means any purported Transfer of Corporation Securities to the extent that such Transfer is prohibited and/or void under
this Article Ninth.
“Restriction Release Date” means the earliest of:
(i)    the repeal, amendment or modification of Section 382 of the Tax Code (and any comparable successor provisions) in such a
way as to render the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the Tax Code no longer applicable to the Corporation;
(ii)    the beginning of a taxable year of the Company Group (or any successor thereof) in which the Board determined that no Tax
Benefits are available;
(iii)     the date selected by the Board if the Board determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section 382 of the Tax Code as
of such date in the event of an “ownership change” of the Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the Tax Code and Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) would not be materially less than the net operating loss carryforwards or “net unrealized built-in loss” (within the
meaning of Section 382 of the Tax Code and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) of the Corporation; and
(iv)    the date selected by the Board if the Board determines that it is in the best interests of the Corporation’s shareholders for the
restrictions set forth in section (b) of this Article Ninth to be removed or released.
“Substantial Shareholder” means a Person with a Percentage Stock Ownership of 4.75% or more.
“Tax Benefit” means any net operating loss carryovers, capital loss carryovers, excess interest deduction carryovers, general business credit
carryovers, alternative minimum tax credit carryovers and foreign tax credit carryovers, as well as any loss or deduction attributable to a “net
unrealized built-in loss” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Tax Code, of the Company Group or any member thereof.
“Tax Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
“Transfer” means the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of ownership of Corporation Securities by any means – including, without limitation,
(i) the creation or grant of any pledge (or other security interest), right or option with respect to Corporation Securities, including an option within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-4(d)(9), (ii) the exercise of any such pledge, right or option, or (iii) any other transaction treated under
the applicable rules under Section 382 of the Tax Code as a direct or indirect acquisition (including the acquisition of an ownership interest in a
Substantial Shareholder), provided, that “Transfer” shall not include any such acquisition unless, as a result, there would be an increase in any
Person’s Percentage Stock Ownership .
“Trust Subsidiary” has the meaning provided for in section (c)(i)(A) of this Article Ninth.
3
“Utility” means Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

“Utility Preferred Stock” means preferred stock issued by Utility (other than preferred stock described in Section 1504(a)(4) of the Tax
Code).
“Utility Securities” means (i) shares of common stock issued by Utility, (ii) Utility Preferred Stock, and (iii) any other interest designated as
“stock” of Utility by the Board, as disclosed in an SEC filing by Utility.
(b)    Prohibited Transfers. Any attempted Transfer of Corporation Securities prior to the Restriction Release Date, or any attempted Transfer
of Corporation Securities pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the Restriction Release Date, shall be prohibited and void ab initio insofar as it
purports to transfer ownership or rights in respect of such stock to the purported transferee of a Prohibited Transfer (a “Purported Transferee”) to the extent
that, as a result of such Transfer (or any series of Transfers of which such Transfer is a part), either (1) any Person shall become a Substantial Shareholder other
than by reason of Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T(j)(3) or (2) the Percentage Stock Ownership interest of any Substantial Shareholder shall be increased.
Nothing in this Article Ninth shall preclude the settlement of any transaction with respect to Corporation Securities entered into through the facilities of a
national securities exchange; provided, however, that such a transaction shall still constitute a Prohibited Transfer and the Corporation Securities and parties
involved in such transaction shall remain subject to the provisions of this Article Ninth in respect of such transaction. In the event that there is an attempted
concurrent Transfer of both Corporation Securities and Utility Securities that would be a Prohibited Transfer hereunder and under the Utility Charter (as
determined without regard to this sentence), the Prohibited Transfer provisions of the Utility Charter shall be applied first rendering such attempted Transfer of
the Utility Securities null and void to the extent necessary, and this section (b) of this Article Ninth shall then be applied to the attempted Transfer of the
Corporation Securities the extent necessary.
(c)    Exceptions; Authorized Transfers.
(i)    The restrictions set forth in section (b) of this Article Ninth shall not apply to the acquisition of Corporation Securities by the
“Fire Victim Trust” as defined in and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or an attempted Transfer (1) if the transferor or the transferee
obtains the prior written approval of the Board or a committee thereof in accordance with section (c)(ii) of this Article Ninth below, or (2) if such
Transfer is (A) made as part of certain transactions approved by the Board in accordance with section (c)(iii) of this Article Ninth, or (B) to the
Corporation or Utility. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) a sale, disposition or other transfer of Corporation Securities by the Fire
Victim Trust or a Trust Subsidiary to a direct Public Group (including a new direct Public Group created under Treasury Regulation § 1.382-2T(j)(3)
(i)), including, without limitation, pursuant to customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona
fide public offering, shall be permitted; and (ii) the provisions of Treasury Regulation §1.382-3(j)(13) (regarding deemed proportionate acquisitions by
existing Public Groups) shall not create any limitation on a sale, disposition, or other transfer of Corporation Securities by the Fire Victim Trust or a
Trust Subsidiary to any Public Group otherwise permitted under this Article Ninth; provided¸ that no transaction under this sentence shall be
permitted if or to the extent a public shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.382-2T(f)(11)) would become a Substantial Shareholder or a
Substantial Shareholder would increase its Percentage Stock Ownership in violation of this Article Ninth. “Public Group” has the meaning set forth in
Treasury Regulation § 1.382-2T(f)(13) and, for the avoidance of doubt, is not a “Person” for purposes of this Article Ninth. Notwithstanding any
other restriction set forth in this Article Ninth, the Fire Victim Trust shall be permitted to:
(A)    Sell, dispose of, or otherwise transfer Corporation Securities to a subsidiary that is, directly or indirectly, owned
100% by the Fire Victim Trust (a “Trust Subsidiary”);
(B)    Pledge, or enter into security arrangements with respect to, Corporation Securities or the equity interests of a Trust
Subsidiary, provided that the creation or exercise of such pledge or security arrangements would not result in any Person becoming a
Substantial Shareholder or cause the Percentage Stock Ownership of any Substantial Shareholder to be increased; and
(C)    Issue, transfer or structure an option with respect to the Corporation Securities or the equity interests of a Trust
Subsidiary, provided that the creation or
4
exercise of such option would not result in any Person becoming a Substantial Shareholder or cause the Percentage Stock Ownership
of any Substantial Shareholder to be increased.
The Board shall not take any action to cause any of (A)-(C) to constitute or be deemed to constitute a Prohibited Transfer.
(ii)    The restrictions contained in this Article Ninth are for the purposes of reducing the risk that any “ownership change” (as
defined in Section 382 of the Tax Code) with respect to the Company Group may limit the Company Group’s ability to utilize its Tax Benefits. In
connection therewith, and to provide for effective policing of these provisions, any Person or Acquiring Group that desires to acquire Corporation
Securities in an otherwise Prohibited Transfer (a “Requesting Person”) shall, prior to the date of such transaction for which the Requesting Person
seeks authorization (the “Proposed Transaction”), request in writing (a “Request”) that the Board review the Proposed Transaction and authorize or
not authorize the Proposed Transaction in accordance with this section (c) of this Article Ninth. A Request shall be mailed or delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation’s principal place of business. Such Request shall be deemed to have been received by the Corporation
when actually received by the Corporation. A Request shall include: (1) the name, address and telephone number of the Requesting Person; (2) the
Percentage Stock Ownership then beneficially owned by the Requesting Person (without regard to the ownership of Company Group Securities in any
subsidiary of the Corporation), the then number and percentage (by class) of any Company Group Securities in any subsidiary of the Corporation
beneficially owned by the Requesting Person, and the then number and percentage (by class) of any Company Group Securities in any subsidiary of
the Corporation beneficially owned by any Acquiring Group of which the Requesting Person is a member (and the names and relationship of the
Persons within the Acquiring Group); (3) a reasonably detailed description of the Proposed Transaction or Proposed Transactions for which the
Requesting Person seeks authorization; and (4) a request that the Board authorize the Proposed Transaction pursuant to this section (c) of this Article
Ninth. The Board shall respond to each Request within 20 business days of receiving such Request, and the failure of the Board to respond during
such 20 business day period shall be deemed to be a consent to the Transfer; provided, that, the Board may respond by requesting additional
information, indicating it requires additional time to consider the Request or in another reasonable manner. The Board shall authorize a Proposed
Transaction unless the Board determines in good faith that the Proposed Transaction, considered alone or with other transactions (including, without
limitation, past, concurrent, contemplated or anticipated transactions (whether by the Corporation, by another Person pursuant to a Request or
otherwise, whether or not the transaction was a Prohibited Transfer) and transactions involving Company Group Securities (including issuances and
redemptions) not currently contemplated but which, in the business judgment of the Board, the Corporation should retain the flexibility to pursue)
would create a material risk that the Tax Benefits may be jeopardized as a result of the application of Sections 382 and 383 of the Tax Code, allowing
for a reasonable margin of safety; provided, that, if multiple Requests are submitted to the Board at approximately the same time and all such Requests
would not be approved pursuant to this sentence, the Board may determine any reasonable method to apply the provisions of this sentence to such
Requests. Any determination by the Board not to authorize a Proposed Transaction shall cause such Proposed Transaction to continue to be treated as a
Prohibited Transfer. The Board may impose any conditions that it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection with authorizing any Proposed
Transaction, including requiring an affidavit or representations from such Requesting Person or opinions of counsel to be rendered by counsel selected
by the Requesting Person (and reasonably acceptable to the Board), in each case, as to such matters as the Board may reasonably determine with
respect to the preservation of the Tax Benefits. Any Requesting Person who makes a Request to the Board shall reimburse the Corporation, within 30
days of demand therefor, for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Corporation with respect to evaluating the Proposed
Transaction of such Requesting Person, including, without limitation, the Corporation’s reasonable costs and expenses incurred in determining
whether to authorize the Proposed Transaction, which costs may include, but are not limited to, any reasonable expenses of counsel and/or tax
advisors engaged by the Board to advise the Board or deliver an opinion thereto. The Board may require, as a condition to its consideration of the
Request, that the Requesting Person execute an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation providing for the
reimbursement of such costs and expenses. Any authorization of the Board hereunder may be given prospectively or retroactively.
(iii)    The Board may determine that the restrictions set forth in section (b) of this Article Ninth shall not apply to any particular
transaction or transactions, whether or not a request has been made to the Board, including a Request pursuant to this section (c) of this Article Ninth,
subject to any conditions that it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection therewith. Any determination of the Board hereunder may be made
prospectively or retroactively.
5
(iv)    The Board or any committee of the Board, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may exercise the authority granted by this
Article Ninth through duly authorized officers or agents of the Corporation. Nothing in this section (c) of this Article Ninth shall be construed to
limit or restrict the Board in the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
(d)    Legend; Notation. The Board may require that any certificates representing shares of Corporation Securities issued prior to the
Restriction Release Date shall contain a conspicuous legend in substantially the following form, or as may otherwise be determined by the Board, evidencing
the restrictions set forth in this Article Ninth:
“THE AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OF THE CORPORATION, AS THE SAME MAY BE
AMENDED AND RESTATED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE “ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION”), CONTAIN CERTAIN
RESTRICTIONS PROHIBITING THE TRANSFER (AS DEFINED IN THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION) OF CORPORATION
SECURITIES (AS DEFINED IN THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION) WITHOUT THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION IF SUCH TRANSFER MAY AFFECT THE PERCENTAGE OF STOCK
OF THE CORPORATION (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 382 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS
AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THE TREASURY REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER) THAT IS TREATED
AS OWNED BY A “SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDER” AS DEFINED IN THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. A COMPLETE AND
CORRECT COPY OF THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION SHALL BE FURNISHED FREE OF CHARGE TO THE HOLDER OF
RECORD OF THIS CERTIFICATE UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION.”
The Corporation shall have the power to make appropriate notations upon its stock transfer records and to instruct any transfer agent, registrar, securities
intermediary or depository with respect to the requirements of this Article Ninth for any uncertificated Corporation Securities or Corporation Securities held in
an indirect holding system, and the Corporation shall provide notice of the restrictions on transfer and ownership to holders of uncertificated shares in
accordance with applicable law.
(e)    Treatment of Excess Securities.
(i)    No officer, employee or agent of the Corporation shall record any Prohibited Transfer, and the Purported Transferee shall not be
recognized as a shareholder of the Corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Excess Securities. Until the Excess Securities are acquired
by another Person in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall not be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities to
any rights of shareholders of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or
distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any. Once the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a
Prohibited Transfer, Corporation Securities shall cease to be Excess Securities. For this purpose, any transfer of Excess Securities not in accordance
with the provisions of this section (e) of this Article Ninth shall also be a Prohibited Transfer.
(ii)    If the Board determines that a Transfer of Corporation Securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer pursuant to section (b) of
this Article Ninth, then, upon written demand by the Corporation, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or
other evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported Transferee’s possession or control, together with any Prohibited
Distributions, to the Agent. The Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers, which may include the Corporation, the Excess Securities transferred
to it in one or more arm’s-length transactions (over the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange on which Corporation
Securities may be traded, if possible, or otherwise privately); provided, however, that the Agent shall use reasonable efforts to effect such sale or sales
in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if, in the Agent’s discretion, such sale or sales
would disrupt the market for Corporation Securities or otherwise would adversely affect the value of Corporation Securities. If the Purported
Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the Corporation’s demand to surrender Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported
Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions
and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the Corporation grants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain all or a portion of
such sales proceeds to the extent not exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to section (e)
(iii) of this Article Ninth if the Agent rather than the Purported Transferee had resold the Excess Securities.
6
(iii)    The Agent shall apply any proceeds or any other amounts received by it in accordance with section (e)(ii) of this Article
Ninth as follows: (A) first, such amounts shall be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with its duties hereunder; (B) second, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by the
Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or in the case of any Prohibited Transfer by gift, devise or inheritance or any other Prohibited Transfer
without consideration, the fair market value, (1) calculated on the basis of the closing market price for Corporation Securities on the day before the
Prohibited Transfer, (2) if Corporation Securities are not listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange but are traded in the over-the-counter
market, calculated based upon the difference between the highest bid and lowest asked prices, as such prices are reported by the relevant inter-dealer
quotation service or any successor system on the day before the Prohibited Transfer or, if none, on the last preceding day for which such quotations
exist, or (3) if Corporation Securities are neither listed nor admitted to trading on any stock exchange nor traded in the over-the-counter market, then
as determined in good faith by the Board), which amount (or fair market value) shall be determined at the discretion of the Board; and (C) third, any
remaining amounts, subject to the limitations imposed by the following proviso, shall be paid to one or more organizations qualifying under Section
501(c)(3) of the Tax Code (or any comparable successor provision) selected by the Board; provided, however, that if the Excess Securities (including
any Excess Securities arising from a previous Prohibited Transfer not sold by the Agent in a prior sale or sales) represent a 4.75% or greater
Percentage Stock Ownership, then any such remaining amounts to the extent attributable to the disposition of the portion of such Excess Securities
exceeding a 4.75% Percentage Stock Ownership interest shall be paid to two or more organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the Tax
Code selected by the Board, such that no organization qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the Tax Code shall be deemed to possess a Percentage
Stock Ownership in excess of 4.75%. The recourse of any Purported Transferee in respect of any Prohibited Transfer shall be limited to the amount
payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to clause (B) of the preceding sentence. In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities
pursuant to this section (e) of this Article Ninth inure to the benefit of the Corporation.
(iv)    In the event of any Transfer that does not involve a transfer of Corporation Securities within the meaning of the laws of the
State of California, but that would cause a Substantial Shareholder to violate any restriction on Transfer provided for in section (b) of this Article
Ninth, the application of sections (e)(ii) and (e)(iii) of this Article Ninth shall be modified as described in this section (e)(iv) of this Article Ninth. In
such case, no such Substantial Shareholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is not a Corporation Security, but such Substantial
Shareholder and/or any Person or Acquiring Group whose ownership of Corporation Securities is attributed to or taken into account with respect to
such Substantial Shareholder shall, in the case of section (e)(ii) of this Article Ninth, be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to dispose
of sufficient Corporation Securities (which Corporation Securities shall be disposed of in the inverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such
Substantial Shareholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of this Article Ninth. Such disposition or process shall be deemed to occur
simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such number of Securities that are deemed to be disposed of shall
be considered Excess Securities and shall be disposed of through the Agent as provided in sections (e)(ii) and (e)(iii) of this Article Ninth, except that
the maximum aggregate amount payable either to such Substantial Shareholder, or to such other Person or Acquiring Group that was the direct holder
of such Excess Securities, in connection with such sale shall be the fair market value of such Excess Securities at the time of the purported Transfer.
All such reasonable expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing of such Excess Securities shall be paid out of any amounts due such Substantial
Shareholder or such other Person or Acquiring Group. The purpose of this section (e)(iv) of this Article Ninth is to extend the restrictions in sections
(b) and (e)(ii) of this Article Ninth to situations in which there is a Prohibited Transfer without a direct Transfer of Securities, and this section (e)(iv)
of this Article Ninth, along with the other provisions of this Article Ninth, shall be interpreted to produce the same results, with differences as the
context requires, as a direct Transfer of Corporation Securities.
(v)    If the Purported Transferee fails to surrender the Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof to the Agent within 30 days
from the date on which the Corporation makes a written demand pursuant to section (e)(ii) of this Article Ninth, then the Corporation shall use its
best efforts to enforce the provisions hereof, including the institution of legal proceedings to compel the surrender. Nothing in this section (e)(v) of this
Article Ninth shall (A) be deemed to be inconsistent with any Transfer of the Excess Securities provided in this Article Ninth to be void ab initio, or
(B) preclude the Corporation in its discretion from immediately instituting legal proceedings without a prior demand. The Board or a committee
thereof may authorize such additional actions as it deems advisable to give effect to the provisions of this Article Ninth.
7
(vi)    The Corporation shall make the written demand described in section (e)(ii) of this Article Ninth within 30 days of the date on
which the Board determines that the attempted Transfer would result in Excess Securities; provided, however, that, if the Corporation makes such
demand at a later date, the provisions of this Article Ninth shall apply nonetheless. No failure by the Corporation to act within the time periods set
forth in section(e) of this Article Ninth shall constitute a waiver or loss of any right of the Corporation under this Article Ninth.
(f)    Obligation to Provide Information. Any Person that is a beneficial, legal or record holder of Corporation Securities or a member of an
Acquiring Group, and any proposed transferor or transferee and any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the proposed transferor or
transferee, shall as and to the extent reasonably requested in writing by the Corporation, use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to provide such
information the Corporation may request as may be necessary from time to time in order to determine compliance with this Article Ninth or the status of the
Tax Benefits.  For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section (f) of this Article Ninth, in no event will any Person have
any obligation to provide any such information that such Person determines, in its reasonable judgment, it is legally or contractually prohibited from disclosing;
provided, that the Board may decline to authorize a Proposed Transaction, notwithstanding any provision of section (c)(ii) of this Article Ninth to the contrary,
if any Requesting Person does not provide any information reasonably requested by the Corporation.
(g)    Board Authority.
(i)    The Board or any committee thereof shall have the power to interpret or determine in its sole discretion all matters necessary
for assessing compliance with this Article Ninth, including, without limitation, (i) the identification of Substantial Shareholders or Acquiring Groups,
(ii) whether a Transfer is a Prohibited Transfer, (iii) whether to exempt a Transfer from the restrictions of section (b) of this Article Ninth, (iv) the
Percentage Stock Ownership of any Substantial Shareholder, (v) whether an instrument constitutes a Company Group Security, (vi) the amount (or fair
market value) due to a Purported Transferee pursuant to clause (B) of section (e)(iii) of this Article Ninth, and (vii) any other matters which the Board
or such committee determines to be relevant; and the good faith determination of the Board or such committee on such matters shall be conclusive and
binding for all the purposes of this Article Ninth.
(ii)    In addition, the Board or any committee thereof may, to the extent permitted by law, from time to time establish, modify,
amend or rescind bylaws, regulations and procedures of the Corporation not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article Ninth for purposes of
determining whether any Transfer of Corporation Securities would jeopardize the Company Group’s ability to preserve and use the Tax Benefits and
for the application, administration and implementation of this Article Ninth.
(iii)    Nothing contained in this Article Ninth shall limit the authority of the Board or a committee thereof to take such other action
to the extent permitted by law as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Company Group and the Corporation’s shareholders in preserving the
Tax Benefits, including the implementation of restrictions on dispositions or sales of Corporation Securities that result in a decrease of a Substantial
Shareholder’s Percentage Stock Ownership. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a change in law making one or more of
the following actions necessary or desirable, the Board or any committee thereof may, by adopting a written resolution, (A) modify the ownership
interest percentage in the Corporation or the Persons covered by this Article Ninth, (B) modify the definitions of any terms set forth in this Article
Ninth or (C) modify the terms of this Article Ninth as appropriate, in each case, in order to prevent an ownership change for purposes of Section 382
of the Tax Code as a result of any changes in applicable Treasury Regulations or otherwise; provided, however, that the Board or committee shall not
cause there to be such modification unless it determines that such action is reasonably necessary or advisable to preserve the Tax Benefits or that the
continuation of these restrictions is no longer reasonably necessary for the preservation of the Tax Benefits. Shareholders of the Corporation shall be
notified of such determination through a filing with the SEC or such other method of notice as the Corporation deems appropriate.
(iv)    In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Article Ninth, including any definition used
herein, the Board shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions. In the event this Article Ninth requires an action by the Board
but fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board or any committee thereof shall have the power to determine the action to
be taken. All such actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations that are done or made by the Board shall be conclusive and binding on the
Corporation, the Agent and all other parties for all other purposes of this Article Ninth. The Board may delegate all or any portion of its duties and
powers under this Article Ninth to a committee of the Board as it deems necessary or advisable, and, to the Board and such committee may exercise
the authority granted by this Article Ninth through
8
duly authorized officers or agents of the Corporation. Nothing in this Article Ninth shall be construed to limit or restrict the Board in the exercise of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
(v)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall take no action pursuant to this Article Ninth, including without limitation this
section (g) of this Article Ninth, to restrict any sale, disposition, or other transfer of Corporation Securities by the Fire Victim Trust that do not result
in Prohibited Transfers and are otherwise permitted under this Article Ninth.
(h)    Reliance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation and the members of the Board or any committee thereof shall be fully
protected in relying in good faith upon the information, opinions, reports or statements of the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, the chief
accounting officer, the Secretary or the corporate controller of the Corporation or of the Corporation’s legal counsel, independent auditors, transfer agent,
investment bankers or other employees and agents in making the determinations and findings contemplated by this Article Ninth, and the members of the
Board shall not be responsible for any good faith errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence and identity of, and the
amount of any Corporation Securities owned by any shareholder, the Corporation is entitled to rely on the existence and absence of filings of Schedule 13D,
13F or 13G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or similar statements, reports or other filings, as of any date, subject to its actual knowledge of the
ownership of Corporation Securities.
(i)    Benefits of this Article Ninth. Nothing in this Article Ninth shall be construed to give to any Person other than the Corporation, the
Agent and members of the Board and such committee thereof any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Article Ninth. This Article Ninth shall
be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Corporation, the Agent and members of the Board or any such committee thereof.
(j)    Severability. The purpose of this Article Ninth is to facilitate the Company Group’s ability to maintain or preserve its Tax Benefits. If
any provision of this Article Ninth or the application of any such provision to any Person or under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Article Ninth.
(k)    Waiver. With regard to any power, remedy or right provided herein or otherwise available to the Corporation or the Agent under this
Article Ninth, (i) no waiver will be effective unless expressly contained in a writing signed by the waiving party, and (ii) no alteration, modification or
impairment will be implied by reason of any previous waiver, extension of time, delay or omission in exercise, or other indulgence.    
        TENTH: If any subsidiary of the Corporation is the holder of record of shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock as of the record date for the payment
of any dividend of cash or property (other than a dividend of shares of the Corporation) to the holders of the Corporation’s Common Stock, that subsidiary shall
not be entitled to receive payment of any such dividend, and the Corporation shall automatically and without any further action be entitled to retain any such
dividend that would otherwise be payable to its subsidiary in respect of such shares. For purposes of this Article Tenth, “subsidiary” means a corporation shares
of which possessing more than 50 percent of the voting power are owned directly or indirectly through one or more subsidiaries of the Corporation.

Description of the Common Stock
General
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 3,600,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 400,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31,
2022, there were approximately 2,465,528,538 shares of our Common Stock, no par value, outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. All
outstanding shares of our Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable.
We may issue our Common Stock from time to time upon such terms and for such consideration as may be determined by our Board of Directors. Such further
issuances, up to the aggregate amounts authorized by our Articles of Incorporation, will not require approval by our shareholders. We may also issue Common
Stock from time to time under dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans.
Voting Rights
Except as otherwise provided by law, holders of our Common Stock have voting rights on the basis of one vote per share on each matter submitted to a vote at
a meeting of shareholders, subject to any class or series voting rights of holders of our preferred stock. Our shareholders may not cumulate votes in elections of
directors. As a result, the holders of our Common Stock and (if issued) preferred stock entitled to exercise more than 50% of the voting rights in an election of
directors can elect all of the directors to be elected if they choose to do so. In such event, the holders of the remaining Common Stock and preferred stock
voting for the election of directors will not be able to elect any persons to the Board of Directors.
Dividend Rights
Holders of our Common Stock, subject to any prior rights or preferences of preferred stock outstanding, have equal rights to receive dividends if and when
declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, except for dividends of cash or property.
Liquidation Rights
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment of all prior claims, holders of our Common Stock would be entitled to receive any
of our remaining assets, subject to any preferential rights of holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock.
Conversion, Redemption and Preemptive Rights
Internal
Holders of our Common Stock have no preemptive rights to subscribe for additional shares of Common Stock or any of our other securities, nor do holders of
our Common Stock have any redemption or conversion rights.
Listing
Our Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PCG.”
Transfer Agent and Registrar
The transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is EQ Shareowner Services.
Limitations on Rights of Holders of Common Stock - Preferred Stock
The rights of holders of Common Stock may be materially limited or qualified by the rights of holders of preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Set
forth below is a description of PG&E Corporation’s authority to issue preferred stock and the possible terms of that stock.
Our Board of Directors is authorized, pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, to issue up to 400,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to
fix and determine the number of shares of preferred stock of any series, to determine the designation of any such series, to increase or decrease the number of
shares of any such series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series, and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to
or imposed upon any such series.
Prior to the issuance of shares of each series of our preferred stock, our Board of Directors is required to adopt resolutions and file a certificate of determination
with the Secretary of State of the State of California. The certificate of determination will fix for each series the designation and number of shares and the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the shares including, but not limited to, the following:
•the title and stated value of the preferred stock;
•voting rights, if any, of the preferred stock;
•any rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions);
•the dividend rate(s), period(s) and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation applicable to the preferred stock;
•whether dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends on the preferred stock will accumulate;
•the relative ranking and preferences of the preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs;
•the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred stock will be convertible into our Common Stock, including the conversion price (or manner
of calculation) and conversion period;
•the provision for redemption, if applicable, of the preferred stock;
•the provisions for a sinking fund, if any, for the preferred stock;
•liquidation preferences;
•any limitations on issuance of any class or series of preferred stock ranking senior to or on a parity with the class or series of preferred stock as to dividend
rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; and
•any other specific terms, preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of the preferred stock.
All shares of preferred stock will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable and will not have any preemptive or similar rights.
In addition to the terms listed above, we will set forth in a prospectus supplement the following terms relating to the class or series of preferred stock being
offered:
•the number of shares of preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock;
•the procedures for any auction and remarketing, if any, for the preferred stock;
•any listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange; and
•a discussion of any material and/or special United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred stock.
Until our Board of Directors determines the rights of the holders of a series of preferred stock, we cannot predict the effect of the issuance of any shares of such
series of preferred stock upon the rights of holders of our Common Stock. However, the effect could include one or more of the following:
•restricting dividends on our Common Stock;
•diluting the voting power of our Common Stock;
•impairing the liquidation rights of our Common Stock; or
•delaying or preventing a change in control of us without further action by our shareholders.
Our preferred stock, if issued, would rank, with respect to dividends and upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up:
•senior to all classes or series of our Common Stock and to all of our equity securities ranking junior to the preferred stock;
•on a parity with all of our equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank on a parity with the preferred stock; and
•junior to all of our equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank senior to the preferred stock.
Holding Company Structure
PG&E Corporation conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries and substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries,
including Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the “Utility”). Accordingly, PG&E Corporation’s cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largely
dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of these earnings to PG&E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans
or advances and repayment of loans and advances. PG&E Corporation’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any
amounts or make any funds available for payment pursuant to PG&E Corporation’s obligations.
Because PG&E Corporation is a holding company, its obligations will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries,
including all debt securities and issued and outstanding preferred stock of the Utility (see Exhibit 4.60(b)) for a description of such preferred stock).
Furthermore, the rights of PG&E Corporation to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or reorganization of the subsidiary will be
subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary’s creditors, including any holders of preferred stock of such subsidiary. To the extent that PG&E Corporation is
itself a creditor with recognized claims against any of its subsidiaries, its claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interest in, or mortgages
or other liens on, the assets of the subsidiary and would be subordinated to any indebtedness or other liabilities of the subsidiary that are senior to the claims
held by PG&E Corporation.
Description of the Equity Units
In July and August 2020, we issued 16,000,000 Equity Units, each with a stated amount of $100. Each Equity Unit is comprised of (i) a prepaid forward stock
purchase contract (a “purchase contract”) of PG&E Corporation and (ii) a 1/48,000th undivided beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasury strips
that mature on a quarterly basis from, and including, August 15, 2020 through, and including, August 15, 2023 and are held by the custodian as agent for the
holders of the Equity Units (a “U.S. treasury strips component”). The following summary of the terms of the Equity Units, the summary of the terms of the
purchase contracts set forth under the caption “Description of the Purchase Contracts” and the summary of the terms of the U.S. treasury strips components set
forth under the caption “Description of the U.S. Treasury Strips Components” below contain a description of all of the material terms of the Equity Units and
their components but are not complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, the related contracts. We refer you to the purchase
contract agreement and the custodial agreement, which are incorporated by reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of the Equity Units
Each Equity Unit is comprised of:
• a prepaid forward stock purchase contract of PG&E Corporation entitling the holder to receive a number of shares of our Common Stock
on August 16, 2023 (subject to postponement in certain limited circumstances, the “purchase contract settlement date”), or earlier if a
“fundamental change” occurs prior to the settlement date or if the holder has elected “early settlement” (in each case, as defined herein
and described below), determined by reference to the settlement rate described below; and
• a U.S. treasury strips component.
Unless previously settled at the holder’s option as described in “Description of the Purchase Contracts-Early Settlement” or “Description of the Purchase
Contracts-Early Settlement Upon a Fundamental Change,” we will deliver to the holder, on the purchase contract settlement date, in respect of each purchase
contract not more than 10.5263 shares of our Common Stock and not less than 8.5929 shares of our Common Stock, based upon the applicable “settlement
rate” (as defined below), which is subject to adjustment as described herein, and the “applicable market value” (as defined below) of our Common Stock, as
described below under “Description of the Purchase Contracts-Delivery of Common Stock.”
Each holder of Equity Units will be paid the amount received by the custodian from the U.S. government in respect of each U.S. treasury strip underlying the
Equity Units owned by such holder on the business day immediately following the date such U.S. treasury strip matures on February 15, May 15, August 15
and November 15 of each year, with such payments commencing on, and including, August 17, 2020, and ending on, and including, August 16, 2023, as
described below under “Description of the U.S. Treasury Strips Components.”
The stated amount of each Equity Unit must be allocated between the U.S. treasury strips component and the purchase contract based upon their relative fair
market values. We have determined that the fair market value of each U.S. treasury strips component is $17.1402 and the fair market value of each purchase
contract is $82.8574. Each holder agrees to such allocation and this position is binding upon each holder (but not on the Internal Revenue Service).
Separating and Recreating Equity Units
Upon the conditions and under the circumstances described below, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) has the right to separate its
Equity Units into its component parts, and a holder of 48,000 separate purchase contracts (or any integral multiple thereof) and the underlying U.S. treasury
strips has the right to combine these components to recreate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof).
Separating Equity Units
At initial issuance, the purchase contracts and U.S. treasury strips components may be purchased and transferred only as Equity Units and will trade under the
CUSIP number for the Equity Units.
On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to,
but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) will
have the right to separate such Equity Units and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units. Because each Equity Unit evidences a
1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasury strips, any separation of Equity Units may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000
Equity Units. To withdraw the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity Units, the holder must:
• deliver the relevant Equity Units to the purchase contract agent; and
• deliver a notice to the purchase contract agent requesting that the purchase contract agent instruct the custodian to release to the holder the
U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units.
The purchase contract agent will then (i) cancel the Equity Units and deliver to the holder the purchase contracts underlying those Equity Units, which we refer
to as “separate purchase contracts” and (ii) instruct the custodian to deliver to the holder the underlying U.S. treasury strips. If the holder has withdrawn the
U.S. treasury strips previously underlying an Equity Unit, it may either continue to hold the separate purchase contract in global form through the purchase
contract agent or receive a certificate for its separate purchase contract and hold it directly as the owner registered on the purchase contract register maintained
on our behalf by the purchase contract registrar. Any administrative fees and expenses related to withdrawing the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity
Units that are payable to the purchase contract agent or the custodian will be at the expense of the holder of Equity Units requesting withdrawal.
“Business day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or obligated by
applicable law or executive order to close or be closed.
There is no current or expected trading market for the separate purchase contracts and we do not intend to apply to have the separate purchase contracts listed
on any securities exchange or quoted on any automated quotation system. Accordingly, we do not expect there to be a liquid market in the separate purchase
contracts at any time. Separate purchase contracts and the withdrawn U.S. treasury strips will be transferable independently from each other.
Recreating Equity Units
On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to,
but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 separate purchase contracts (or any integral
multiple thereof) will have the right to recreate Equity Units by delivering, for every 48,000 Equity Units being recreated, (i) to the purchase contract agent,
48,000 separate purchase contracts, and (ii) to the custodian, $66,000 face amount (or $33,000 face amount in the case of the U.S. treasury strips maturing on
August 15, 2020) of each of the U.S. treasury strips that would be then remaining as a portion of the U.S. treasury strips component of an Equity Unit. Any
recreation of Equity Units may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units. The newly deposited U.S. treasury strips used to recreate the Equity
Units must have the same CUSIP numbers as the ones originally comprising the U.S. treasury strips component.
Global Securities
Each Equity Unit and purchase contract are represented by global securities registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).
Holders are not entitled to receive definitive physical certificates for the Equity Units and purchase contracts, except under the limited circumstances described
under “Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement.” Beneficial interests in an Equity Unit and, after separation, the separate purchase contract, will be represented
through book-entry accounts of, and transfers will be effected through, direct or indirect participants in DTC.
Deemed Actions by Holders by Acceptance
Each holder of Equity Units or separate purchase contracts, by acceptance of such securities, is deemed to have:
• irrevocably authorized and directed the purchase contract agent to execute, deliver and perform on its behalf the purchase contract
agreement, and appointed the purchase contract agent as its attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes;
• in the case of a purchase contract that is a component of an Equity Unit, or that is evidenced by a separate purchase contract, irrevocably
authorized and directed the purchase contract agent to execute, deliver and hold on its behalf the separate purchase contract or the
component purchase contract evidencing such purchase contract, and appointed the purchase contract agent as its attorney-in-fact for any
and all such purposes;
• consented to, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and provisions of the purchase contract agreement;
• in the case of a holder of an Equity Unit, agreed, for all purposes, including U.S. federal income tax purposes, to treat:
• an Equity Unit as an investment unit composed of two separate instruments, in accordance with its form;
• the allocation of the stated amount per Equity Unit between the purchase contract and the U.S. treasury strips component so that
such holder’s initial tax basis in each purchase contract will be $82.8574 and such holder’s initial tax basis in each U.S. treasury
strips component will be $17.1402;
• represented and warranted that neither the beneficial holder of the purchase contracts (including for these purposes a purchase contract
that is a component of any Equity Unit) nor, to the knowledge of such beneficial holder, any other person, would become a “Substantial
Shareholder” (as defined in the Amended Articles) as a result of such beneficial holder’s acquisition of purchase contracts (treating the
beneficial holder and any such other person as actually holding, solely for purposes of this representation, the number of shares of our
Common Stock that would be received upon settlement at the maximum settlement rate of all purchase contracts acquired or beneficially
owned by such beneficial holder or any such other person, as applicable, but treating all other purchase contracts as still unsettled), and,
for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account such beneficial holder’s and any such other person’s (i) current ownership of our Common
Stock and any of the Utility’s preferred stock and (ii) other acquisitions of our Common Stock and any of the Utility’s preferred stock (if
any) concurrent with or in connection with such beneficial holder’s acquisition of purchase contracts; and
• appointed the custodian to hold on its behalf and to receive payments related to the U.S. treasury strips components and agreed to
indemnify the custodian from and against any liability it may incur in connection with such appointment in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct on its part.
Listing of Securities
Our Equity Units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “PCGU.” However, listing on the NYSE does not guarantee that a trading market will develop, and
the underwriters may discontinue market making at any time in their sole discretion without prior notice to Equity Unit holders. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that a liquid trading market will develop for the Equity Units (or, if developed, that a liquid trading market will be maintained), that the holder will
be able to sell Equity Units at a particular time or that the prices the holder receives when the holder sells will be favorable.
Title
The purchase contract agent may treat the registered owner of any Equity Unit, which at initial issuance was a nominee of DTC, or, upon withdrawal of the
U.S. treasury strips, the registered owner of any separate purchase contract, as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of making payment and settling the
purchase contracts and
for all other purposes. Similarly, the custodian may treat the registered owner of any Equity Unit as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of making
payments of the U.S. treasury strips components and deliveries of the underlying U.S. treasury strips, if applicable, and for all other purposes.
Accounting for the Equity Units
We record the issuance of the purchase contract portion of the Equity Units as Common Stock, net of issuance costs of the purchase contracts, in our financial
statements. All of the proceeds from the issuance of the U.S. treasury strips components were paid to the custodian, and we did not receive any proceeds from
such issuance.
Based on U.S. GAAP, we do not expect the purchase contract component of the Equity Units to be revalued under fair value accounting principles.
Our earnings per share calculations will reflect the shares issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts portion of the Equity Units. Our basic earnings per
share will include the minimum shares issuable under the purchase contract for each period and our diluted earnings per share will include any incremental
shares that would be issuable assuming a settlement of the purchase contract at the end of each accounting period, if dilutive.
Replacement of Equity Unit Certificates
In the event that physical certificates evidencing the Equity Units have been issued, any mutilated equity unit certificate will be replaced by us at the expense of
the holder upon surrender of the certificate to the purchase contract agent. Equity Unit certificates that have been destroyed, lost or stolen will be replaced by us
at the expense of the holder upon delivery to us and the purchase contract agent of evidence of their destruction, loss or theft satisfactory to us and the purchase
contract agent. In the case of a destroyed, lost or stolen Equity Unit certificate, an indemnity satisfactory to us and the purchase contract agent may be required
at the expense of the holder of the Equity Units before a replacement will be issued.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not be obligated to replace any Equity Unit certificates on or after the second scheduled trading day immediately
preceding August 16, 2023 or any early settlement date. In those circumstances, the purchase contract agreement will provide that, in lieu of the delivery of a
replacement Equity Unit certificate, the purchase contract agent, upon delivery of the evidence and indemnity described above, will deliver or arrange for
delivery of the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the purchase contracts included in the Equity Units evidenced by the Equity Unit certificate.
Miscellaneous
The purchase contract agreement provides that we will pay all fees and expenses related to the offering of the Equity Units and the enforcement by the
purchase contract agent of the rights of the holders of the Equity Units or the separate purchase contracts, other than expenses (including legal fees) of the
underwriters.
Should the holder elect to separate or recreate Equity Units, the holder will be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection with that separation
or recreation, and we will have no liability therefor.
Description of the Purchase Contracts
The purchase contracts are issued pursuant to the terms and provisions of the purchase contract agreement. The following summary contains a description of all
of the material terms of the purchase contracts but is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the
purchase contract agreement, including the definitions in the purchase contract agreement of certain terms. We refer you to the purchase contract agreement
which is incorporated by reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Each purchase contract will initially form a part of an Equity Unit. On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the business day
immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16,
2023, the holder will have the right to separate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those
Equity Units. Following such separation, purchase contracts may be transferred separately from the U.S. treasury strips components.
Delivery of Common Stock
Unless settled early at the holder’s option, for each purchase contract we will deliver to the holder on August 16, 2023 (subject to postponement in certain
limited circumstances described below, the “purchase contract settlement date”), a number of shares of our Common Stock. The number of shares of our
Common Stock issuable upon settlement of each purchase contract (the “settlement rate”) will be determined by us as follows:
• if the applicable market value of our Common Stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price, then the holder will receive 8.5929
shares of Common Stock for each purchase contract (the “minimum settlement rate”);
• if the applicable market value of our Common Stock is greater than or equal to the reference price but less than or equal to the threshold
appreciation price, then the holder will receive a number of shares of Common Stock for each purchase contract equal to the Equity Unit
stated amount of $100, divided by the applicable market value; and
• if the applicable market value of our Common Stock is less than the reference price, then the holder will receive 10.5263 shares of
Common Stock for each purchase contract (the “maximum settlement rate”).
The maximum settlement rate and minimum settlement rate are each subject to adjustment as described under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed
Settlement Rates” below. Each of the minimum settlement rate and the maximum settlement rate is referred to as a “fixed settlement rate.”
The reference price is equal to $100 divided by the maximum settlement rate and is approximately equal to $9.5000.
The threshold appreciation price is equal to $100 divided by the minimum settlement rate. The threshold appreciation price, which is initially approximately
$11.6375, represents an appreciation of approximately 22.50% over the reference price.
For illustrative purposes only, the following table shows the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of a purchase contract at assumed
applicable market values, based on a reference price of $9.5000 and a threshold appreciation price of $11.6375. The table assumes that there will be no
adjustments to the fixed settlement rates described below under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates” below or settled early at the option
of holders as described under “-Early Settlement” or “-Early Settlement Upon a Fundamental Change” below. There can be no assurance that the actual
applicable market value will be within the assumed range set forth below.
A holder of an Equity Unit or a separate purchase contract, as applicable, would receive on the purchase contract settlement date the following numbers of
shares of Common Stock for each Equity Unit or separate purchase contract at the following assumed applicable market values:
Assumed Applicable Market ValueNumber of Shares of
Common Stock
$2.00 10.5263
$4.00 10.5263
$6.00 10.5263
$8.00 10.5263
$9.50 10.5263
$10.50 9.5238
$11.64 8.5929
$13.00 8.5929
$15.00 8.5929
$18.00 8.5929
$21.00 8.5929
$25.00 8.5929
$30.00 8.5929
$35.00 8.5929
As the above table illustrates, if, on the purchase contract settlement date, the applicable market value is greater than the threshold appreciation price, we would
be obligated to deliver 8.5929 shares of Common Stock for each purchase contract.
If, on the purchase contract settlement date, the applicable market value is less than or equal to the threshold appreciation price but greater than or equal to the
reference price of approximately $9.5000, we would be obligated to deliver a number of shares of our Common Stock on the purchase contract settlement date
equal to $100, divided by the applicable market value. As a result, we would retain all appreciation in the market value of our Common Stock underlying each
purchase contract between the reference price and the threshold appreciation price.
If, on the purchase contract settlement date, the applicable market value is less than the reference price of approximately $9.5000, we would be obligated to
deliver upon settlement of the purchase contract 10.5263 shares of Common Stock for each purchase contract, regardless of the market price of our Common
Stock. As a result, the holder would suffer the full decline in market value of the Common Stock below the reference price.
Because the applicable market value of the Common Stock is determined over the “valuation period” (as defined below), the number of shares of Common
Stock delivered for each purchase contract may be greater than or less than the number that would have been delivered based on the closing price (or daily
VWAP) of the Common Stock on the last trading day of such valuation period. In addition, the holder will bear the risk of fluctuations in the market price of
the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon settlement of the purchase contracts between the end of such valuation period and the date such shares are
delivered.
The term “applicable market value” means the arithmetic average of the daily VWAPs of our Common Stock on each trading day of the valuation period.
The term “valuation period” means each of the 20 consecutive trading days beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day immediately preceding
August 16, 2023.
The “daily VWAP” of our Common Stock on any trading day means the per share volume-weighted average price as displayed under the heading “Bloomberg
VWAP” on Bloomberg page “PCG <equity> AQR” (or its equivalent successor if such page is not available) in respect of the period from the scheduled open
of trading until the scheduled close of trading of the primary trading session on such trading day (or if such volume-weighted average price is unavailable, the
market value of one share of our Common Stock on such trading day determined, using a volume-weighted average method, by a nationally recognized
independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by us). The “daily VWAP” will be determined without regard to after-hours trading or any other
trading outside of the regular trading session trading hours. The “average VWAP” per share over a certain period means the arithmetic average of the daily
VWAP per share for each trading day in such period.
“Trading day” means a day on which (i) there is no “market disruption event” (as defined below) and (ii) trading in our Common Stock (or other security for
which a daily VWAP must be determined) generally occurs on the NYSE or, if our Common Stock (or such other security) is not then listed on the NYSE, on
the principal other U.S. national or regional securities exchange on which our Common Stock (or such other security) is then listed or, if our Common Stock
(or such other security) is not then listed on a U.S. national or regional securities exchange, on the principal other market on which our Common Stock (or such
other security) is then traded. If our Common Stock (or such other security) is not so listed or traded, “trading day” means a “business day.”
“Scheduled trading day” means a day that is scheduled to be a trading day on the NYSE or, if our Common Stock is not then listed on the NYSE, on the
principal other U.S. national or regional securities exchange on which our Common Stock is then listed or, if our Common Stock is not then listed on a U.S.
national or regional securities exchange, on the principal other market on which our Common Stock is then traded. If our Common Stock is not so listed or
admitted for trading, “scheduled trading day” means a “business day.”
“Market disruption event” means (i) a failure by the primary U.S. national or regional securities exchange or market on which our Common Stock is listed or
admitted for trading to open for trading during its regular trading session or (ii) the occurrence or existence prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on any
scheduled trading day for our Common Stock for more than one half-hour period in the aggregate during regular trading hours of any suspension or limitation
imposed on trading (by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the relevant stock exchange, relevant market or otherwise) in our Common
Stock or in any options contracts or futures contracts relating to our Common Stock.
On the purchase contract settlement date, our Common Stock will be issued and delivered to the holder or the holder’s designee, upon (i) surrender of
certificates representing the purchase contracts, if such purchase contracts are held in certificated form, and (ii) payment by the holder of any transfer or similar
taxes payable in connection with the issuance of our Common Stock to any person other than the holder. As long as the purchase contracts are evidenced by
one or more global purchase contract certificates deposited with DTC, procedures for settlement will be governed by DTC’s applicable procedures.
If one or more of the 20 consecutive scheduled trading days in the valuation period is not a trading day, the purchase contract settlement date will be postponed
until the second business day immediately following the last trading day of the valuation period.
Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last trading day of the valuation period, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not
be outstanding, and the holder of such purchase contract will not have any voting rights, rights to dividends or other distributions or other rights of a holder of
our Common Stock by virtue of holding such purchase contract. The person in whose name any shares of our Common Stock shall be issuable upon settlement
of the purchase contract on the purchase contract settlement date will be treated as the holder of record of such shares as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the last trading day of the 20 consecutive trading day period during which the applicable market value is determined.
We will pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of our Common Stock upon settlement of the purchase
contracts, unless the tax is due because the holder requests any shares to be issued in a name other than the holder’s name, in which case the holder will pay
that tax.
Early Settlement
Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, any holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any
integral multiple thereof) or a holder of one or more separate purchase contracts, may elect to settle such Equity Units or separate purchase contracts early and
receive a number of shares of Common Stock per purchase contract equal to the “early settlement rate.” The early settlement rate is equal to the minimum
settlement rate on the early settlement date, subject to adjustment as described below under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates,” unless
the holder elects to settle the holder’s purchase contracts early in connection with a fundamental change, in which case the holder will receive upon settlement
of the holder’s purchase contracts a number of shares of our Common Stock based on the “fundamental change early settlement rate” as described under “-
Early Settlement Upon a Fundamental Change.” We refer to this right as the “early settlement right.”
The holder’s right to receive Common Stock upon early settlement of a purchase contract is subject to (i) delivery of a written and signed notice of election (an
“early settlement notice”) to the purchase contract agent electing early settlement of such purchase contract, (ii) if such purchase contract or the Equity Unit
that includes such purchase contract is held in certificated form, surrendering the certificates representing the purchase contract and (iii) payment
by the holder of any transfer or similar taxes payable in connection with the issuance of our Common Stock to any person other than the holder. As long as the
purchase contracts or the Equity Units are evidenced by one or more global certificates deposited with DTC, procedures for early settlement will be governed
by DTC’s applicable procedures.
Upon surrender of the Equity Unit or the separate purchase contract, as applicable, and payment of any applicable transfer or similar taxes due because of any
issue of such shares in a name of a person other than the holder, the holder will receive the applicable number of shares of Common Stock (and any cash
payable for fractional shares) due upon early settlement on the second business day following the “early settlement date” (as defined below).
If the holder complies with the requirements for effecting the early settlement right prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day, then that day
will be considered the “early settlement date.” If the holder complies with such requirements at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day or
at any time on a day that is not a business day, then the next succeeding business day will be considered the “early settlement date.” Prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the early settlement date, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not be outstanding, and the holder of such
purchase contract will not have any voting rights, rights to dividends or other distributions or other rights of a holder of our Common Stock by virtue of holding
such purchase contract. The person in whose name any shares of our Common Stock shall be issuable upon such early settlement of the purchase contract will
be treated as the holder of record of such shares as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant early settlement date.
Because each Equity Unit evidences a 1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasury strips, any early settlement of Equity Units may be
made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units.
Upon early settlement at the holder’s election of purchase contracts held as components of Equity Units, the custodian will deliver the U.S. treasury strips
evidenced by those Equity Units to such holder free and clear of any liens or other encumbrances on the second business day following the early settlement
date.
Early Settlement Upon a Fundamental Change
If a “fundamental change” occurs and the holder elects to settle the holder’s purchase contracts early in connection with such fundamental change in
accordance with the procedures described under “-Early Settlement” above, the holder will receive per purchase contract a number of shares of our Common
Stock or cash, securities or other property, as applicable, equal to the “fundamental change early settlement rate,” as described below. An early settlement will
be deemed for these purposes to be “in connection with” such fundamental change if the holder delivers the holder’s early settlement notice to the purchase
contract agent, and otherwise satisfies the requirements for effecting early settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, during the period beginning on, and
including, the effective date of the fundamental change and ending at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 35th business day thereafter (or, if earlier, the
second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023) (the “fundamental change early settlement period”). We refer to this right as the
“fundamental change early settlement right.”
If the holder complies with the requirements for effecting the fundamental change early settlement right prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any
business day during the fundamental change early settlement period, then that day will be considered the “fundamental change early settlement date.” If the
holder complies with such requirements at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any business day during the fundamental change early settlement period
or at any time on a day during the fundamental change early settlement period that is not a business day, then the next succeeding business day will be
considered the “fundamental change early settlement date.”
Any early settlement of Equity Units in connection with a fundamental change may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000 Equity Units.
We will provide the purchase contract agent, custodian and the holders of Equity Units and separate purchase contracts with a notice of a fundamental change
within five business days after its effective date and issue a press release announcing such effective date. The notice will also set forth, among other things, (i)
the applicable fundamental change early settlement rate, (ii) if not Common Stock, the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property receivable by the
holder upon settlement and (iii) the deadline by which each holder’s fundamental change early settlement right must be exercised.
A “fundamental change” will be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following:
• any “person” or “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), other than
us, any of our wholly owned subsidiaries and any of our and their employee benefit plans, files a Schedule TO or any other schedule,
form or report under the Exchange Act disclosing that such person or group has become the direct or indirect “beneficial owner” (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock;
• the consummation of (A) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of our Common Stock (other than changes resulting from a
subdivision or combination) as a result of which our Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities,
other property or assets; (B) any share exchange, consolidation or merger of us pursuant to which our Common Stock will be converted
into cash, securities or other property or assets; or (C) any sale, lease or other transfer in one transaction or a series of transactions of all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person other than one of our wholly owned
subsidiaries; or
• our Common Stock (or other Common Stock receivable upon settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, if applicable) ceases to be
listed or quoted on any of the NYSE, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market (or any of their respective
successors).
A transaction or transactions described in either of the first two bullets above will not constitute a fundamental change, however, if (i) at least 90% of the
consideration received or to be received by stockholders of our Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares) in connection with such
transaction or transactions consists of shares of Common Stock that are listed on any of the NYSE, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ
Global Market (or any of their respective successors), or will be so listed when issued or exchanged in connection with such transaction or transactions and (ii)
as a result of such transaction or transactions such consideration becomes the consideration receivable upon settlement of the holder’s purchase contracts, if
applicable, excluding cash payments for fractional shares.
If any transaction in which our Common Stock is replaced by the securities of another entity occurs, following completion of any related fundamental change
early settlement period (or, in the case of a transaction that would have been a fundamental change but for the immediately preceding paragraph, following the
effective date of such transaction), references to us in the definition of “fundamental change” above shall instead be references to such other entity.
The “fundamental change early settlement rate” will be determined by us by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the fundamental change
occurs or becomes effective (the “fundamental change effective date”) and the “stock price” in the fundamental change, which will be:
• in the case of a fundamental change described in the second bullet of the definition of “fundamental change” in which all holders of
shares of our Common Stock receive only cash in the fundamental change, the stock price will be the cash amount paid per share of our
Common Stock; and
• in all other cases, the stock price will be the arithmetic average of the daily VWAPs of our Common Stock over the five consecutive
trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding such fundamental change effective date.
The stock prices set forth in the column headings of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the fixed settlement rates are adjusted. The
adjusted stock prices will equal the stock prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
maximum settlement rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the stock price adjustment and the denominator of which is the maximum
settlement rate as so adjusted. The fundamental change early settlement rates per purchase contract in the table below will be adjusted in the same manner and
at the same time as the fixed settlement rates as set forth under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates.”
The following table sets forth the fundamental change early settlement rate per purchase contract for each stock price and fundamental change effective date set
forth below:

The exact stock prices and fundamental change effective dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:
• if the applicable stock price is between two stock prices in the table or the applicable fundamental change effective date is between two
fundamental change effective dates in the table, the fundamental change early settlement rate will be determined by straight line
interpolation between the fundamental change early settlement rates set forth for the higher and lower stock prices and the earlier and later
fundamental change effective dates, as applicable, based on a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable;
• if the applicable stock price is greater than $35.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the stock
prices set forth in the column headings of the table above), then the fundamental change early settlement rate will be the minimum
settlement rate; or
• if the applicable stock price is less than $2.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the stock prices
set forth in the column headings of the table above, the “minimum stock price”), the fundamental change early settlement rate will be
determined as if the stock price equaled the minimum stock price, and using straight line interpolation, as described in the first bullet of
this paragraph, if the fundamental change effective date is between two fundamental change effective dates in the table.
The maximum number of shares of our Common Stock deliverable under a purchase contract is 10.5263, subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the
same time as the fixed settlement rates as set forth under “-Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates.”
Our obligation to settle the purchase contracts at the fundamental change early settlement rate could be considered a penalty, in which case the enforceability
thereof would be subject to general principles of reasonableness of economic remedies.
We will deliver the shares of our Common Stock, securities, cash or other property payable as a result of the holder’s exercise of the fundamental change early
settlement right on the second business day following the fundamental change early settlement date. Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
fundamental change early settlement date, the shares of Common Stock underlying each purchase contract will not be outstanding, and the holder of such
purchase contract will not have any voting rights, rights to dividends or other distributions or other rights of a holder of our Common Stock by virtue of holding
such purchase contract. The person in whose name any shares of our Common Stock or other securities, if applicable, shall be issuable following exercise of a
holder’s
fundamental change early settlement right will be treated as the holder of record of such shares or other securities, if applicable, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the fundamental change early settlement date.
Upon early settlement of purchase contracts held as components of Equity Units at the holder’s election upon a fundamental change, the custodian will deliver
the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by those Equity Units to such holder free and clear of any liens or other encumbrances on the second business day following
the fundamental change early settlement date.
If the holder does not elect to exercise the holder’s fundamental change early settlement right, the holder’s purchase contracts will remain outstanding and will
be subject to normal settlement on any subsequent early settlement date or any subsequent fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be.
Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates
Each fixed settlement rate will be adjusted as described below, except that we will not make any adjustments to the fixed settlement rates if holders of the
purchase contracts participate (other than in the case of a share split or share combination or a tender or exchange offer described in clause (5) below), at the
same time and upon the same terms as holders of our Common Stock and solely as a result of holding the purchase contracts, in any of the transactions
described below without having to settle their purchase contracts as if they held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the maximum settlement rate
as of the record date for such transaction, multiplied by (ii) the number of purchase contracts held by such holder.
(1) If we exclusively issue shares of our Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of our Common Stock, or if we effect a share
split or share combination, each fixed settlement rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x OS1
OS0
where,
CR0 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date (as defined below) of such
dividend or distribution, or immediately prior to the open of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination,
as applicable;
CR1 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately after the close of business on such record date or immediately after the open of
business on such effective date, as applicable;
OS0 = the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such record date or
immediately prior to the open of business on such effective date, as applicable, before giving effect to such dividend, distribution,
share split or share combination; and
OS1 = the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or
share combination.
Any adjustment made under this clause (1) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution,
or immediately after the open of business on the effective date for such share split or share combination, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the
type described in this clause (1) is declared but not so paid or made, each fixed settlement rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date our
board of directors or a committee thereof determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such
dividend or distribution had not been declared. For the purposes of this clause (1), the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the close of business on the relevant record date or immediately prior to the open of business on the relevant effective date, as the case
may be, and the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or share
combination shall, in each case, not include shares that we hold in treasury. We will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of our Common
Stock that we hold in treasury.
“Effective date” as used in this clause (1) means the first date on which the shares of our Common Stock trade on the relevant stock exchange, regular way,
reflecting the relevant share split or share combination, as applicable.
“Record date” means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of our Common Stock (or other applicable
security) have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which our Common Stock (or such other security) is exchanged for or converted
into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of holders of our Common Stock (or such other security) entitled to
receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, statute, contract or
otherwise).
(2) If we issue to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them, for a period of not more
than 45 calendar days after the announcement date of such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of our Common Stock at a price per
share that is less than the average VWAP per share of our Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and
including, the trading day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, each fixed settlement rate will be increased
based on the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x OS0 + X
OS0 + Y
where,
CR0 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such issuance;
CR1 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately after the close of business on such record date;
OS0 = the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such record date;
X = the total number of shares of our Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; and
Y =the number of shares of our Common Stock equal to (i) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants,
divided by (ii) the average VWAP per share of our Common Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and
including, the trading day immediately preceding the date of announcement of the issuance of such rights, options or warrants.
Any increase made under this clause (2) will be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective
immediately after the close of business on the record date for such issuance. To the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their
expiration or shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the exercise of such rights, options or warrants, each fixed settlement rate shall be decreased to
such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of
delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered, if any. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, each fixed settlement
rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereof determines not to issue
such rights, options or warrants to such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such record date for such issuance had not occurred.
For the purpose of this clause (2), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders of our Common Stock to subscribe for or purchase
shares of our Common Stock at less than such average VWAP per share for the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day
immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of our Common Stock, there
shall be taken into account any consideration received by us for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the
value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by our board of directors in good faith.
(3) If we distribute shares of our capital stock, evidences of our indebtedness, other assets or property of ours or rights, options or warrants to
acquire our capital stock or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock, excluding:
• dividends, distributions or issuances as to which the provisions set forth in clause (1) or (2) shall apply;
• dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which the provisions set forth in clause (4) below shall apply;
• any distributions upon conversion of, or in exchange for, our Common Stock in connection with a recapitalization, reclassification,
change, consolidation, merger or other combination, share exchange, or sale, lease or other transfer or disposition resulting in the
change in the consideration due upon settlement of the purchase contracts as described below under “-Recapitalizations,
Reclassifications and Changes of Our Common Stock”;
• except as otherwise described below, rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan adopted by us; and
• spin-offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this clause (3) shall apply;
then each fixed settlement rate will be increased based on the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x SP0
SP0 - FMV
where,
CR0 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such distribution;
CR1 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately after the close of business on such record date;
SP0 = the average VWAP per share of our Common Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the
trading day immediately preceding the ex-date (as defined below) for such distribution; and
FMV = the fair market value (as determined by our board of directors in good faith) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of
indebtedness, assets, property, rights, options or warrants so distributed, expressed as an amount per share of our Common Stock
on the ex-date for such distribution.
“Ex-date” means the first date on which the shares of our Common Stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the
right to receive the issuance, dividend or distribution in question, from us or, if applicable, from the seller of our Common Stock on such exchange or market
(in the form of due bills or otherwise) as determined by such exchange or market.
Any increase made under the portion of this clause (3) above will become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such
distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, each fixed settlement rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date our board of directors
or a committee thereof determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had
not been declared.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “FMV” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each holder
shall receive, in respect of each purchase contract, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of our Common Stock, without having to settle such
purchase contract, the amount and kind of our capital stock, evidences of our indebtedness, other assets or property of ours or rights, options or warrants to
acquire our capital stock or other securities that such holder would have received if such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
maximum settlement rate in effect on the record date for the distribution.
If we issue rights, options or warrants that are only exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, then:
• we will not adjust the fixed settlement rates pursuant to the foregoing in this clause (3) until the earliest of these triggering events occurs;
and
•we will readjust the fixed settlement rates to the extent any of these rights, options or warrants are not exercised before they expire;
provided that the rights, options or warrants trade together with our Common Stock and will be issued in respect of future issuances of the
shares of our Common Stock.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (3) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on our Common Stock of shares of
capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit, that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or
admitted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange, which we refer to as a “spin-off,” each fixed settlement rate will be increased based on the
following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x FMV0 + MP0
MP0
where,
CR0 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the ex-date for the spin-off;
CR1 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately after the open of business on the ex-date for the spin-off;
FMV0 = the average VWAP per share of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of our Common Stock applicable
to one share of our Common Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the ex-date for
the spin-off, or the “valuation period”; and
MP0 = the average VWAP per share of our Common Stock over the valuation period.
The increase to each fixed settlement rate under the preceding paragraph will be calculated as of the close of business on the last trading day of the valuation
period but will be given retroactive effect as of immediately after
the open of business on the ex-date of the spin-off. Because we will make the adjustment to each fixed settlement rate with retroactive effect, we will delay the
settlement of any purchase contract where any date for determining the number of shares of our Common Stock issuable to a holder occurs during the valuation
period until the second business day after the last trading day of such valuation period. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid, each fixed settlement rate
shall be decreased, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereof determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to be such
fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(4) If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock, each fixed settlement rate will be
adjusted based on the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x SP0
SP0 - C
where,
CR0 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution;
CR1 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution;
SP0 = the average VWAP per share of our Common Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the
Trading Day immediately preceding the ex-date for such distribution; and
C = the amount in cash per share we distribute to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock.
Any increase made under this clause (4) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the record date for such dividend or distribution. If
such dividend or distribution is not so paid, each fixed settlement rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date our board of directors or a committee thereof
determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not
been declared.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “C” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each holder
shall receive, in respect of each purchase contract, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of our Common Stock, without having to
settle such purchase contract, the amount of cash that such holder would have received if such holder owned a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to
the maximum settlement rate on the record date for such cash dividend or distribution.
(5) If we or any of our subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for our Common Stock, to the extent that the cash
and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the average VWAP per share of our
Common Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the trading day next succeeding the last date on
which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, or the “expiration date”, each fixed settlement rate will
be increased based on the following formula:
CR1 = CR0 x AC + (SP1x OS1)
OS0 x SP1
where,
CR0 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the expiration date;
CR1 = such fixed settlement rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the expiration date;
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by our board of directors in good faith) paid or payable
for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer;
OS0 = the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the expiration date (prior to giving effect to the
purchase of all shares accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer);
OS1 = the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately after the expiration date (after giving effect to the purchase of
all shares accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer); and
SP1 = the average VWAP of our Common Stock over the ten consecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the trading
day next succeeding the expiration date (the “averaging period”).
The increase to each fixed settlement rate under the preceding paragraph will be calculated at the close of business on the last trading day of the averaging
period but will be given retroactive effect as of immediately after the close of business on the expiration date. Because we will make the adjustment to each
fixed settlement rate with retroactive effect, we will delay the settlement of any purchase contracts where any date for determining the number of shares of our
Common Stock issuable to a holder occurs during the averaging period until the second business day after the last trading day of such averaging period. For the
avoidance of doubt, no adjustment under this clause (5) will be made if such adjustment would result in a decrease in any fixed settlement rate.
In the event that we or one of our subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but we or
such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then each fixed settlement
rate shall again be adjusted to be such fixed settlement rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made (or had been
made only in respect of the purchases that have been made and not rescinded).
We may, to the extent permitted by law and the rules of NYSE or any other securities exchange on which our Common Stock or the purchase contracts is then
listed, increase each fixed settlement rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 business days if such increase is irrevocable during such 20 business days
and our board of directors (or a committee thereof) determines that such increase would be in our best interest. In addition, we may make such increases in
each fixed settlement rate as we deem advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of our Common Stock resulting from any dividend or
distribution of shares of our Common Stock (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares of our Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for
income tax purposes or for any other reason. We may only make such a discretionary adjustment if we make the same proportionate adjustment to each fixed
settlement rate.
Beneficial owners of the purchase contracts may, in certain circumstances, including upon a distribution of cash dividends to holders of our shares of Common
Stock, be deemed to have received a distribution subject to U.S. federal income tax as a dividend as a result of an adjustment or the nonoccurrence of an
adjustment to the fixed settlement rates. See “Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences.”
If we have a rights plan in effect upon settlement of the purchase contracts into Common Stock, the holder will receive, in addition to any shares of Common
Stock received in connection with such settlement, the rights under the rights plan. However, if, prior to any settlement, the rights have separated from the
shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable rights plan, each fixed settlement rate will be adjusted at the time of
separation as if we distributed to all or substantially all holders of our Common Stock, shares of our capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property,
rights, options or warrants as described in clause (3) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. We
do not currently have a stockholder rights plan in effect.
Adjustments to the fixed settlement rates will be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of our Common Stock, and corresponding adjustments to the
reference price and the threshold appreciation period will be calculated to the nearest $0.0001.
The fixed settlement rate will not be adjusted:
• upon the issuance of any shares of our Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends
or interest payable on our securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan;
• upon the issuance of any shares of our Common Stock or options, rights or warrants to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or
future benefit or other incentive plan or program of or assumed by us or any of our subsidiaries;
• subject to the second immediately preceding paragraph, upon the issuance of any shares of our Common Stock pursuant to any option,
warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in the preceding bullet and outstanding as of the date the
purchase contracts were first issued;
• for a change in the par value of our Common Stock;
• for stock repurchases that are not tender or exchange offers referred to in clause (5) of the adjustments above, including structured or
derivative transactions or pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors that is not a tender or exchange offer
referred to in clause (5).
Except as otherwise provided above, we will be responsible for making all calculations called for under the purchase contracts. These calculations include, but
are not limited to, determinations of the fundamental change early settlement rate, the stock price in connection with a fundamental change, the daily VWAP,
the average VWAPs and the fixed settlement rates of the purchase contracts.
We will be required, within ten business days after the fixed settlement rates are adjusted, to provide or cause to be provided written notice of the adjustment to
the holders of the purchase contracts. We will also deliver to the purchase contract agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the
adjustment to each fixed settlement rate was determined and setting forth each adjusted fixed settlement rate.
For the avoidance of doubt, if an adjustment is made to the fixed settlement rates, no separate inversely proportionate adjustment will be made to the reference
price or the threshold appreciation price because the reference price is equal to $100 divided by the maximum settlement rate (as adjusted in the manner
described herein) and the threshold appreciation price is equal to $100 divided by the minimum settlement rate (as adjusted in the manner described herein).
Whenever the terms of the purchase contracts require us to calculate the daily VWAP per share of our Common Stock over a span of multiple days, our board
of directors will make appropriate adjustments in good faith (including, without limitation, to the applicable market value, the early settlement rate or the
fundamental change early settlement rate (as the case may be)) to account for any adjustments to the fixed settlement rates (as the case may be) that become
effective, or any event that would require such an adjustment if the record date, ex-date, effective date or expiration date (as the case may be) of such event
occurs, during the relevant period used to calculate such prices or values (as the case may be).
If:
• the record date for a dividend or distribution on shares of our Common Stock occurs after the end of the 20 consecutive trading day period
used for calculating the applicable market value and before the purchase contract settlement date; and
• that dividend or distribution would have resulted in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable to the holders of the purchase
contracts had such record date occurred on or before the last trading day of such 20-trading day period,
then we will deem the holders of the purchase contracts to be holders of record of our Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution. In this case,
the holders of the purchase contracts would receive the dividend or distribution on our Common Stock together with the number of shares of our Common
Stock issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts.
Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of Our Common Stock
In the event of:
• any consolidation or merger of us with or into another person;
• any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all of our property and assets;
• any reclassification of our Common Stock into securities (other than a share split or share combination), including securities other than
our Common Stock; or
• any statutory exchange of our securities with another person (other than in connection with a consolidation or merger),
in each case, as a result of which our Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities or other property or assets (including
cash or any combination thereof) (each, a “reorganization event”), each purchase contract outstanding immediately prior to such reorganization event shall,
without the consent of the holders of the purchase contracts, become a contract to purchase the kind of stock, other securities or other property or assets
(including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of our Common Stock would have been entitled to receive in connection with such reorganization
event (such stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof), the “exchange property”, with each “unit of
exchange property” meaning the kind and amount of exchange property that a holder of one share of our Common Stock would have received in such
reorganization event) and, prior to or at the effective time of such reorganization event, we or the successor or purchasing person, as the case may be, shall
execute with the purchase contract agent a supplemental agreement pursuant to the purchase contract agreement and the purchase contracts to provide for such
change in the right to settle the purchase contracts.
If the transaction causes our Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined
based in part upon any form of stockholder election), the exchange property underlying the purchase contracts will be deemed to be the weighted average of the
types and amounts of consideration actually received by the holders of our Common Stock in such reorganization event.
The number of units of exchange property we will deliver upon the settlement of each purchase contract following the effective date of such reorganization
event will be determined as if references to our Common Stock deliverable upon settlement of the purchase contracts on the purchase contract settlement date,
early settlement date or fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be, were to units of exchange property (without interest thereon and without
any right to dividends or distributions thereon which have a record date prior to the date on which holders of the purchase contracts become holders of record
of the underlying shares of our Common Stock). For the purpose of determining which bullet of the definition of settlement rate in the second paragraph under
“-Delivery of Common Stock” will apply upon settlement of each purchase contract, and for the purpose of calculating the settlement rate if the second bullet is
applicable, the value of a unit of exchange property will be determined in good faith by our board of directors (which determination will be final), except that if
a unit of exchange property
includes Common Stock or American Depositary Receipts, or “ADRs”, that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, the value of such Common Stock
or ADRs will be the average over the 20 consecutive trading day period used for calculating the applicable market value of the volume-weighted average prices
for such Common Stock or ADRs, as displayed on the applicable Bloomberg screen (as determined in good faith by our board of directors (which
determination will be final)); or, if such price is not available, the average market value per share of such Common Stock or ADRs over such period as
determined, using a volume-weighted average method, by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by us for this purpose. The
provisions of this paragraph will apply to successive reorganization events, and the provisions summarized under “-Anti-dilution Adjustments to the Fixed
Settlement Rates” will apply to any shares of common equity or ADRs of us or any successor received by the holders of shares of our Common Stock in any
such reorganization event. We (or any successor to us) will, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five calendar days) after the occurrence
of any reorganization event provide written notice to the holders of the purchase contracts of such occurrence and of the kind and amount of cash, securities or
other property that constitute the exchange property. Failure to deliver such notice will not affect the operation of the provisions described in this section.
It is possible that certain consolidations, mergers, combinations or other transactions could result in tax gains or losses to the holders either as a result of the
transaction or the conversion thereafter. Holders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the ownership,
disposition and settlement of the purchase contracts.
Fractional Shares
No fractional shares of our Common Stock will be issued to holders upon settlement of the purchase contracts. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable,
holders will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of our Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the
purchase contracts being settled (provided that, so long as the Equity Units are in global form, we may elect to aggregate Equity Units for purposes of these
calculations on any basis permitted by the applicable procedures of DTC), multiplied by the daily VWAP of our Common Stock on the trading day immediately
preceding the purchase contract settlement date, early settlement date or fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be.
Legal Holidays
In any case where the purchase contract settlement date, early settlement date or fundamental change early settlement date, as the case may be, shall not be a
business day, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in the purchase contract agreement or purchase contract, the settlement of the purchase contracts shall
not be effected on such date, but instead shall be effected on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such settlement
date, and no interest or other amounts shall accrue or be payable by us or to any holder in respect of such delay.
Consequences of Bankruptcy
Pursuant to the terms of the purchase contract agreement, the purchase contract settlement date for each purchase contract, whether held separately or as part of
an Equity Unit, will automatically accelerate upon the occurrence of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us. Pursuant to
the terms of the purchase contract agreement, upon acceleration, holders will be entitled under the terms of the purchase contracts to receive a number of shares
of our Common Stock per purchase contract equal to the maximum settlement rate in effect immediately prior to such acceleration (regardless of the market
value of our Common Stock at that time). However, a bankruptcy court may prevent us from delivering our Common Stock in settlement of the accelerated
purchase contracts. In such event, a holder would have a damage claim against us for the value of the Common Stock that we would have otherwise been
required to deliver upon settlement of the purchase contracts. Any such damage claim that holders have against us following such acceleration will rank pari
passu with the claims of holders of our Common Stock in the relevant bankruptcy proceeding. As such, to the extent we fail to deliver Common Stock to the
holder upon such an acceleration, the holder will only be able to recover damages to the extent holders of our Common Stock receive any recovery.
Modification
The purchase contract agreement contains provisions permitting us and the purchase contract agent to modify the purchase contract agreement or the purchase
contracts without the consent of the holders of purchase contracts (whether held separately or as a component of Equity Units) for any of the following
purposes:
• to evidence the succession of another person to us, and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants and obligations of ours in
the purchase contract agreement and the units and separate purchase contracts, if any;
• to add to the covenants for the benefit of holders of purchase contracts or to surrender any of our rights or powers under the agreement;
• to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment of a successor purchase contract agent;
• upon the occurrence of a reorganization event, solely (i) to provide that each purchase contract will become a contract to purchase
exchange property and (ii) to effect the related changes to the terms of the purchase contracts, in each case, as required by the applicable
provisions of the purchase contract agreement;
• to conform the provisions of the purchase contract agreement to the “Description of the Purchase Contracts” and “Description of the
Equity Units” sections in the preliminary prospectus supplement which forms a part of the registration statement on which the Equity
Units are registered, as supplemented by the related pricing term sheet;
•to cure any ambiguity or manifest error, to correct or supplement any provisions that may be inconsistent or defective; and
• to make any other provisions with respect to such matters or questions, so long as such action does not adversely affect the interest of the
holders in any material respect.
The purchase contract agreement contains provisions permitting us and the purchase contract agent, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority
of the purchase contracts at the time outstanding, to modify the terms of the purchase contracts or the purchase contract agreement. However, no such
modification may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding purchase contract affected by the modification,
• reduce the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon settlement of the purchase contract (except to the extent expressly
required pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustments);
• change the purchase contract settlement date, or adversely modify the early settlement right or the fundamental change early settlement
right; or
• reduce the above-stated percentage of outstanding purchase contracts the consent of the holders of which is required for the modification
or amendment of the provisions of the purchase contracts or the purchase contract agreement.
In executing any modification, the purchase contract agent shall be entitled to receive an opinion of counsel and an officer’s certificate stating that such
modification is authorized or permitted under the terms of the purchase contract agreement.
Consolidation, Merger, Sale or Conveyance
Under the purchase contract agreement, we are permitted to consolidate with or merge with or into another company. We are also permitted to sell, assign,
transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of our assets to another company. However, if we take any of these actions, we must meet the following
conditions:
• the successor entity to such consolidation or merger, or the entity which acquires all or substantially all of our assets, shall expressly
assume all of our obligations under the purchase contracts and the purchase contract agreement;
• the successor entity to such consolidation or merger, or the entity which acquires all or substantially all of our assets, shall be a
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; and
• immediately after the merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance, no default has occurred and is continuing
under the purchase contracts or the purchase contract agreement.
Reservation of Common Stock
We will at all times reserve and keep available out of our authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for issuance upon settlement of the purchase
contracts, the number of shares of Common Stock that would be issuable upon the settlement of all purchase contracts then outstanding, assuming settlement at
the maximum settlement rate.
Governing Law
The purchase contract agreement, the Equity Units and the purchase contracts is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.
Information Concerning the Purchase Contract Agent
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the purchase contract agent. The purchase contract agent acts as the agent for the holders of Equity
Units and separate purchase contracts from time to time. The purchase contract agreement does not obligate the purchase contract agent to exercise any
discretionary actions in connection with a default under the terms of the purchase contracts or the purchase contract agreement.
The purchase contract agreement contains provisions limiting the liability of the purchase contract agent. The purchase contract agreement contains provisions
under which the purchase contract agent may resign or be replaced. This resignation or replacement would be effective upon the acceptance of appointment by
a successor purchase contract agent.
We maintain banking relationships in the ordinary course of business with the purchase contract agent and its affiliates.
Calculations in Respect of Purchase Contracts
We will be responsible for making all calculations called for under the Equity Units and any separate purchase contracts. The purchase contract agent will have
no obligation to make, review or verify any such calculations. All such calculations made by us will be made in good faith and, absent manifest error, will be
final and binding on the purchase contract agent and the holders of the Equity Units and any separate purchase contracts. We will provide a schedule of such
calculations to the purchase contract agent and the purchase contract agent will be entitled to conclusively rely upon the accuracy of such calculations without
independent verification.
Description of the U.S. Treasury Strips Components
The U.S. treasury strips underlying the Equity Units are held by the custodian as agent for the holders of the Equity Units and are subject to the terms of a
custodial agreement between the custodian and purchase contract agent. The following summary contains a description of all of the material terms of the
custodial agreement but is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the custodial agreement,
including the definitions in the custodial agreement of certain terms. We refer you to the custodial agreement which is incorporated by reference to this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
Each U.S. treasury strips component will initially form a part of an Equity Unit. On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the
business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to, but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding
August 16, 2023, the holder will have the right to separate 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiples thereof), and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips
underlying those Equity Units. Following such separation, U.S. treasury strips may be transferred separately from purchase contracts.
Payments of U.S. Treasury Strips
The U.S. treasury strips are held by the custodian as agent for the holders of the Equity Units. The custodian will, upon instructions from the purchase contract
agent, forward to each holder of Equity Units the amount it receives from the U.S. government in respect of each U.S. treasury strip underlying the Equity
Units owned by such holder on the business day immediately following the date such U.S. treasury strip matures on February 15, May 15, August 15 and
November 15 of each year, with such payments commencing on, and including, August 17, 2020, and ending on, and including, August 16, 2023. We expect
that the amount payable per Equity Unit per full quarter as described in the immediately preceding sentence will be equal to $1.3750, which represents an
annual rate of return on the stated amount per Equity Unit of 5.50%. The amount payable per Equity Unit on August 17, 2020 was equal to $0.6875. These
payments will consist of the pro rata amount of all amounts received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. treasury strips. So long as the Equity Units remain
in the form of one or more book-entry, global Equity Unit certificates as described in “-Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement” below, the record date will be
the business day prior to the relevant payment date. If the Equity Units do not remain in the form of one or more book-entry, global Equity Unit certificates, the
relevant record date will be the fifteenth day (whether or not a business day) prior to the relevant payment date.
We have no obligation, responsibility or liability with respect to the purchase of the U.S. treasury strips and their delivery into the custody of the custodian, the
performance or non-performance of the duties of the custodian or any payment of the U.S. treasury strips components. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC has
purchased the U.S. treasury strips to be sold to the purchasers of the Equity Units and delivered to the custodian, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A.
Each Equity Unit will initially evidence its holder’s 1/48,000th beneficial ownership interest in the following U.S. treasury strips, which will constitute one
U.S. treasury strips component:

Role of Custodian
The custodian is the agent of the holders of the Equity Units evidencing the U.S. treasury strips and is not a trustee, and no trust was intended to be created or
was created by the terms of the custodial agreement. The custodian has no
managerial role nor any discretion with respect to the U.S. treasury strips and has no right to deal with the U.S. treasury strips except as specifically provided in
the custodial agreement. The custodian agrees to hold the U.S. treasury strips and exercise the due care of a professional custodian for hire. Under the custodial
agreement, the custodian is required to remit all payments received from the U.S. government in respect of the U.S. treasury strips to the holders of the Equity
Units without making any deduction as instructed by the purchase contract agent.
Ownership of U.S. Treasury Strips
The U.S. treasury strips will at all times be the sole and exclusive property of the holders of the Equity Units. The custodian may not transfer, assign, pledge,
set off or otherwise dispose of any of the U.S. treasury strips or any interests therein, except as expressly permitted by the provisions of the custodial
agreement.
Withdrawal of U.S. Treasury Strips
On any business day during the period beginning on, and including, the business day immediately following the date of initial issuance of the Equity Units to,
but excluding, the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding August 16, 2023, a holder of 48,000 Equity Units (or any integral multiple thereof) will
have the right to separate such Equity Units and withdraw the U.S. treasury strips underlying those Equity Units. To withdraw the U.S. treasury strips
underlying Equity Units, holders must follow the procedures outlined under the above caption “Description of the Equity Units-Separating and Recreating
Equity Units-Separating Equity Units.” The purchase contract agent will then (i) cancel the Equity Units and deliver to the holder the purchase contracts
evidenced by the Equity Units and (ii) instruct the custodian to deliver to the holder such holder’s U.S. treasury strips. Any administrative fees and expenses
related to withdrawing the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity Units that are payable to the purchase contract agent or the custodian will be at the
expense of the holder of Equity Units requesting withdrawal. To recreate the Equity Units, holders must follow the procedures outlined under the above caption
“Description of the Equity Units-Separating and Recreating Equity Units-Recreation of Equity Units.” Because each Equity Unit evidences a 1/48,000th
beneficial ownership interest in specified U.S. treasury strips, any separation or recreation of Equity Units may be made only in integral multiples of 48,000
Equity Units.
Certain Other Provisions of the Custodial Agreement
Delivery of U.S. Treasury Strips
Payments of the U.S. treasury strips components will be made by the custodian to the depositary as long as the Equity Units remain in book-entry form. In
addition, if the Equity Units do not remain in book-entry form, payments may be made, at the option of the custodian, by check mailed to the address of the
person entitled to the payments as shown on the Equity Unit register.
If the purchase contract settlement date is accelerated, U.S. treasury strips will be delivered by the custodian upon presentation and surrender of the Equity Unit
certificates evidencing the related Equity Units at the office of the purchase contract agent or, in the case of book-entry Equity Units, upon presentation and
surrender of the Equity Units in accordance with the procedures of the depositary. Following such acceleration and delivery, the custodian will sell (or, at the
expense of holders, retain the services of a broker dealer that will sell) such U.S. treasury strips, and the custodian will distribute the net cash proceeds of such
sale (less any expenses incurred by the custodian in connection with such sale) on a pro rata basis to holders of Equity Units (or in accordance with the
procedures of the depositary in the case of global Equity Units). Until the Equity Unit certificate is presented and surrendered or the holder provides
satisfactory evidence that the Equity Unit certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the purchase
contract agent, the U.S. treasury strips will be held by the custodian for the account of the holder. The custodian will have no obligation to invest or to pay
interest on any amounts held by the custodian pending delivery.
Modification
The custodial agreement contains provisions prohibiting the custodian and the purchase contract agent, except under limited circumstances, from modifying or
amending the terms of the custodial agreement without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Equity Unit affected by the modification or amendment.
Governing Law
The custodial agreement is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
Information Concerning the Custodian
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., whose designated office is located at 400 South Hope Street, Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90071, acts as
the custodian of the U.S. treasury strips on behalf of the holders of Equity Units from time to time.
The custodial agreement does not obligate the custodian to perform any discretionary actions in connection with the terms of the Equity Units or the custodial
agreement. The custodial agreement also contains provisions limiting the liability of the custodian and the circumstances under which the custodian may resign
or be replaced. No such resignation or replacement will be effective until a successor custodian is appointed.
We maintain banking relationships in the ordinary course of business with the custodian and its affiliates.
Book Entry Procedures and Settlement
Except in the limited circumstances described herein, the Equity Units and the purchase contracts are issued in the form of one or more global Equity Unit
certificates and global purchase contract certificates, respectively, held by the purchase contract agent, as custodian for, and registered in the name of, The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as depositary, or its nominee.
The depositary has advised us as follows: The depositary is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the Banking Law of the State of New York, a
member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency”
registered pursuant to Section 17A of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The depositary was created to hold securities of its
participants (defined below) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. The depositary’s participants include securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and some other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own the
depositary. Access to the depositary’s book-entry system is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly.
No Equity Unit represented by global Equity Unit certificates and no purchase contract represented by global purchase contract certificates may be exchanged
in whole or in part for definitive Equity Units or purchase contracts, as the case may be, and no transfer of global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase
contract certificates in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any person other than the depositary or any nominee of the depositary unless:
• the depositary has notified the purchase contract agent that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for such global Equity Unit
certificates or global purchase contract certificates, as the case may be, or has ceased to be qualified to act as such as required by the
purchase contract agreement;
• there shall have occurred and be continuing a default by us in respect of our obligations under the purchase contract agreement; or
• the beneficial holder of Equity Units elects to withdraw the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by one or more of its Equity Units and elects to
hold the purchase contracts in definitive form.
All Equity Units and purchase contracts represented by one or more global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contract certificates, respectively, or
any portion thereof are registered in such names as the depositary may have directed.
The laws of some jurisdictions require that some purchasers of Equity Units take physical delivery of the Equity Units in definitive form. These laws may
impair a holder’s ability to transfer beneficial interests in Equity Units so long as they are represented by global Equity Unit certificates.
As long as the depositary (or its nominee) is the registered owner of the global Equity Unit certificates and the global purchase contract certificates, the
depositary (or its nominee) will be considered the sole owner and holder of the global Equity Unit certificates, the global purchase contract certificates and all
Equity Units and purchase contracts represented thereby for all purposes under the Equity Units and purchase contracts and the purchase contract agreement.
Except in the limited circumstances referred to above, owners of beneficial interests in global Equity Unit certificates and owners of beneficial interests in
global purchase contract certificates:
• are not be entitled to have the global purchase contract certificates or the purchase contracts represented thereby registered in
their respective names;
• will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Equity Unit certificates or purchase contract certificates, as the case
may be, in exchange therefor; and
• are not be considered to be owners or holders of global Equity Unit certificates or any Equity Units represented thereby or global
purchase contract certificates or any purchase contracts represented thereby, for any purpose under the Equity Units, the purchase
contracts or the purchase contract agreement.
All transfers and deliveries of shares of our Common Stock (and any cash amount paid by us in lieu of fractional shares) issued on settlement of the purchase
contracts evidenced by the Equity Units in global form and all transfers and deliveries of the U.S. treasury strips evidenced by the Equity Units in global form
will be made to the depositary (or its nominee) as the holder thereof. All transfers and deliveries of shares of our Common Stock (and any cash amount paid by
us in lieu of fractional shares) pursuant to the purchase contracts represented by the global purchase contract certificates will be made by the purchase contract
agent to the depositary (or its nominee) as the holder thereof. Cash payments in respect of the U.S. treasury strips component of Equity Units in global form
will be made by the custodian, at the direction of the purchase contract agent, to the depositary (or its nominee) as the holder of such Equity Units.
Ownership of beneficial interests in the global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contract certificates is limited to participants or persons that may
hold beneficial interests through institutions that have accounts with the depositary or its nominee, which we refer to as participants. Ownership of beneficial
interests in global Equity Unit certificates and global purchase contract certificates will be shown only on, and the transfer of those ownership interests will be
effected only through, records maintained by the depositary or its nominee (with respect to participants’ interests) or any such participant (with respect to
interests of persons held by such participants on their behalf). Procedures for settlement of purchase contracts on the purchase contract settlement date or upon
early settlement for holders who hold in book-entry form will be governed by arrangements among the depositary, participants and persons that may hold
beneficial interests through participants designed to permit such settlement without the physical movement of certificates. Payments, transfers, deliveries,
exchanges and other matters relating to beneficial interests in global Equity Unit certificates may be subject to various policies and procedures adopted by the
depositary from time to time. None of PG&E Corporation, the purchase contract agent or the custodian or any of their respective agents will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the depositary’s or any participant’s records relating to, or for payments made on account of, beneficial interests in
global Equity Unit certificates or global purchase contract certificates, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the depositary’s records or any
participant’s records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Notices
So long as the global securities are held on behalf of DTC or any other clearing system, notices to holders of securities represented by a beneficial interest in
the global securities may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to DTC or the alternative clearing system, as the case may be.
EXHIBIT 4.62(b)
DESCRIPTION OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY’S
SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER
SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Description of Preferred Stock
The following description of Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (the “Utility”) preferred stock is only a summary and does not purport to be
complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable law, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation effective as of June 22,
2020 (the “Articles of Incorporation”) and Bylaws amended and restated as of May 20, 2021 (the “Bylaws”), each of which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual
Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to read the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws for additional
information.
In this section, references to “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer only to the Utility and not to any of its direct or indirect parents, subsidiaries or
affiliates except as expressly provided.
General
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 800,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $5 per share, 75,000,000 shares of
first preferred stock with a par value of $25 per share (the “First Preferred Stock”), and 10,000,000 of $100 first preferred stock, cumulative, with a par value of
$100 per share (the “$100 First Preferred Stock” and, together with the First Preferred Stock, the “Preferred Stock”).
All outstanding shares of our common stock are owned by PG&E Corporation. There are no shares of $100 First Preferred Stock outstanding. First
Preferred Stock is issued and outstanding in the following series:
•6% nonredeemable (“6% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock”)
•5.50% nonredeemable (“5.5% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock”)
•5% nonredeemable (“5% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock”)
•5% redeemable (“5% First Preferred Stock”)
•5% series A redeemable (“5% First Preferred Series A Stock”)
•4.80% redeemable (“4.8% First Preferred Stock”)
•4.50% redeemable (“4.5% First Preferred Stock”)
•4.36% series A redeemable (“4.36% First Preferred Stock”)
As of December 31, 2022, the Utility’s First Preferred Stock outstanding included:
•4,211,661 shares of 6% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock;
•1,173,163 shares of 5.5% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock;
•400,000 shares of 5% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock;
•1,778,172 shares of 5% First Preferred Stock;
•934,322 shares of 5% First Preferred Series A Stock;
•793,031 shares of 4.8% First Preferred Stock;
•611,142 shares of 4.5% First Preferred Stock; and
•418,291 shares of 4.36% First Preferred Stock.
Under the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors of the Utility is authorized without further shareholder action to provide for the issuance of
Preferred Stock up to the amounts authorized by the Articles of Incorporation, in one or more series, with such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as
shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such Preferred Stock, or series thereof, adopted, at any time or from time
to time, by the Board of Directors.
Voting Rights
Except as otherwise provided by law, holders of our Preferred Stock have voting rights on the basis of one vote per share on each matter submitted to
a vote at a meeting of shareholders. Our shareholders may not cumulate votes in elections of directors. As a result, the holders of our Preferred Stock entitled to
exercise more than 50% of the voting rights in an election of directors can elect all of the directors to be elected if they choose to do so. In such event, the
holders of the remaining Preferred Stock voting for the election of directors will not be able to elect any persons to the Board of Directors.
Dividend Rights
The owners and holders of shares of Preferred Stock, when issued as fully paid, are entitled to receive, from the date of issue of such share, out of
funds legally available therefor, cumulative preferential dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, at the following rates upon the par value of
their respective shares, and not more:
•6% per year upon the 6% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock
•5.5% per year upon the 5.5% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock
•5% per year upon the 5% First Preferred Series A Stock, 5% First Preferred Stock and 5% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock
•4.8% per year upon the 4.8% First Preferred Stock
•4.5% per year upon the 4.5% First Preferred Stock
•4.36% per year upon the 4.36% First Preferred Stock
Such dividends shall be declared and shall be either paid or set apart for payment before any dividend upon the shares of common stock shall be either
declared or paid. All shares of Preferred Stock rank equally in priority with regard to preference in dividend rights, except that shares of different classes or
different series thereof may differ as to the amounts of dividends to which they are entitled.
Liquidation Rights
Upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Utility at any time and in any manner, the owners and holders of Preferred Stock issued as fully paid will be
entitled to receive an amount equal to the par value of such shares plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to and including the
date fixed for such distribution or payment before any amount shall be paid to the holders of the Utility’s common stock. All shares of Preferred Stock rank
equally in priority with regard to preference in liquidation rights, except that shares of different classes or different series thereof may differ as to the amounts
of liquidation payments to which they are entitled. All shares of Preferred Stock rank senior to common stock with regard to liquidation rights.
If any share or shares of Preferred Stock shall at any time be issued as only partly paid, the owners and holders of such partly paid share or shares shall
have the right to receive dividends and to share in the assets of the Utility upon its liquidation or dissolution in all respects like the owners and holders of fully
paid shares of Preferred
Stock, except that such right shall be only in proportion to the amount paid on account of the subscription price for which such partly paid share or shares shall
have been issued.
Conversion, Redemption and Preemptive Rights
None of the 6% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock, 5.5% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock and 5% Nonredeemable First Preferred Stock is
subject to redemption.
The remaining outstanding series of First Preferred Stock, and any Preferred Stock issued in the future, may be redeemed at the Utility’s option, at any
time or from time to time, at the redemption price fixed for such series of Preferred Stock together with accumulated and unpaid dividends at the rate fixed
therefor to and including the date fixed for redemption. If less than all the outstanding shares of any such series are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed
shall be determined pro rata or by lot in such manner as the Board of Directors may determine. There is no restriction on the repurchase or redemption of
Preferred Stock by the Utility while there is any arrearage in the payment of dividends or sinking fund payments.
Unless the certificate of determination for any series of Preferred Stock shall otherwise provide, notice of every redemption shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City and County of San Francisco, State of California, and in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of
Manhattan, City and State of New York, at least once in each of two (2) successive weeks, commencing not earlier than sixty (60) nor later than thirty (30) days
before the date fixed for redemption; successive publications need not be made in the same newspaper. A copy of such notice shall be mailed within the same
period of time to each holder of record, as of the record date, of the shares to be redeemed, but the failure to mail such notice to any shareholder shall not
invalidate the redemption of such shares.
From and after the date fixed for redemption, unless default be made by the Utility in paying the amount due upon redemption, dividends on the

only for the portion of the calendar year prior to the individual becoming an Eligible Employee. Such calculation shall be done at the Company’s discretion,
using such assumptions and methodologies as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Amounts provided pursuant to this Section will distributed in
a lump-sum, in accordance with Section 6.01(2).
Article 3 - Vesting
3.01    Vesting of Company Contributions. Except as otherwise determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, and provided that the Eligible
Employee has not Separated from Service (other than due to death), an Eligible Employee shall become one hundred percent (100%) vested in the Eligible
Employee’s Account after completing at least three (3) cumulative years of service with any Employer(s). For this purpose, years of service shall be calculated
on an elapsed-time, anniversary date of hire basis. “Years of cumulative service” shall include, without limitation, all service while an active participant in the
Plan or in the SERP, including active service prior to any break in service. An Employee’s service will be deemed to continue while on approved leave of
absence. If an Eligible Employee dies prior to both Separating from Service and satisfying the three-year vesting period, the Eligible Employee’s Account shall
vest in full and be paid out in accordance with Section 6.05, below.
3.02    Amounts Not Vested. Subject to the foregoing, any amounts credited to an Eligible Employee’s Account that are not vested at the time of the Eligible
Employee’s Separation from Service shall be forfeited.
Article 4 – Investment Funds
Although no assets will be segregated or otherwise set aside with respect to an Eligible Employee’s Account, the amount that is ultimately payable to
the Eligible Employee with respect to such Account shall be determined as if such Account had been invested in some or all of the Investment Funds. The Plan
Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall adopt (and modify from time to time) such rules and procedures as it deems necessary or appropriate to implement
the deemed investment of the Eligible Employees’ Accounts. Such procedures generally shall provide that an Eligible Employee’s Account shall be deemed to
be invested among the available Investment Funds in the manner elected by the Eligible Employee in such percentages and manner as prescribed by the Plan
Administrator. In the event no election has been made by the Eligible Employee, such Account will be deemed to be invested in the Investment Funds
designated by the Plan Administrator. Eligible Employees shall be able to reallocate their Accounts between the Investment Funds and reallocate amounts
newly credited to their Accounts at such time and in such manner as the Plan Administrator shall prescribe. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, an
Eligible Employee may not reallocate Account balances between Investment Funds if such reallocation would result in a non-exempt Discretionary
Transaction as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor to Rule 16b-3, as in effect when the reallocation is
requested. The available Investment Funds shall be designated by the Plan Administrator and may be changed from time to time by the Plan Administrator at
its discretion.
Article 5 - Accountings
5.01    Eligible Employees’ Accounts. At the direction of the Plan Administrator, there shall be established and maintained on the books of the Employer, a
separate account for each Eligible Employee in order to reflect his or her interest under the Plan.
5.02    Investment Earnings. Each Eligible Employee’s Account shall initially reflect the value of his or her Account’s interest in each of the Investment
Funds, deemed acquired with the amounts credited thereto. Each Eligible Employee’s Account shall also be credited (or debited) with the net appreciation (or
depreciation), earnings and gains (or losses) with respect to the investments deemed made by his or her Account. Any such net earnings or gains deemed
realized with respect to any investment of any Eligible Employee’s Account shall be deemed reinvested in additional amounts of the same investment and
credited to the Eligible Employee’s Account.
5.03    Accounting Methods. The accounting methods or formulae to be used under the Plan for the purpose of maintaining the Eligible Employees’ Accounts
shall be determined by the Plan Administrator. The accounting methods or formulae selected by the Plan Administrator may be revised from time to time but
shall conform to the extent practicable with the accounting methods used under the Plan.
5.04    Valuations and Reports. The fair market value of each Eligible Employee’s Account shall be determined as of each Valuation Date. In making such
determinations and in crediting net deemed earnings and gains (or losses) in the Investment Funds to the Eligible Employees’ Accounts, the Plan Administrator
(in its discretion) may employ such
3    
PG&E Corpr9oar on
accounting methods as the Plan Administrator (in its discretion) may deem appropriate in order to fairly reflect the fair market values of the Investment Funds
and each Eligible Employee’s Account. For this purpose, the Plan Administrator may rely upon information provided by the Plan Administrator or other
persons believed by the Plan Administrator to be competent.
5.05    Statements of Eligible Employee’s Accounts. Each Eligible Employee shall be furnished with periodic statements of his or her interest in the Plan.
Article 6 - Distributions
6.01    Distribution of Account Balances.
(1)    Participants in SERP. Distribution of the balance credited to the Account of any Eligible Employee who was a participant in the SERP will be made
according to the time and form provisions applicable to that Eligible Employee’s benefits under the SERP. Sections 6.01(2), 6.02, 6.03, 6.04 and 6.05
shall not apply to the Eligible Employees described above in this Section 6.01(1).
(2)    Other Eligible Employees. Except to the extent the Eligible Employee has elected otherwise under this Section 6 at the time of deferral, distribution
of the balance credited to an Eligible Employee’s Account shall be made in a single lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event
within 90 days) following the date that is seven (7) months following Separation from Service.
(3)    DROs. In the case of an Alternate Payee (as defined in Section 7.01(1)), to the extent allowable under Code Section 409A, distribution shall be made
as directed in a domestic relations order approved by the Plan Administrator, but only as to the portion of the Eligible Employee’s Account which the
domestic relations order states is payable to the Alternate Payee.
6.02    Election of Installment Payments. In lieu of the single sum payment under Section 6.01, an Eligible Employee may elect in writing, on such form or
in such other manner as it may prescribe, and file with the Plan Administrator an election that payment of amounts credited to the Eligible Employee’s Account
be made in from 2 to 10 equal annual installments. Installment payments elected before September 17, 2013 will be considered separate payments for purposes
of Code Section 409A. Installment payments will commence as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 90 days) following the date that is
seven (7) months following Separation from Service (“Benefit Commencement Date”), and subsequent installments will be paid on each anniversary of the
Benefit Commencement Date thereof until all installments are paid. However, if during the installment payment period after the Benefit Commencement Date
the Account balance plus the Eligible Employee’s interest in all other Aggregated Plans is less than the dollar limit set forth in Code Section 402(g)(1)(B) in
the aggregate, the value of the remaining installments and such other interest(s) may be accelerated by written election of the Plan Administrator and
subsequently paid as a lump sum at the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator, except to the extent that would result in a violation of Code Section 409A.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.02 to the contrary, if the Eligible Employee’s vested Account balance on the Benefit Commencement Date is less
than $50,000, and prior to September 17, 2013 the Eligible Employee elected pursuant to this Section 6.02 to receive payment in installments, then the
distribution election described in this Section 6.02 shall be disregarded and the Eligible Employee’s entire vested Account balance shall be paid in a lump sum
distribution as described in Section 6.01(2) above.
6.03    Timing of Elections.
(1)    General Rule. The election described in Section 6.02 shall be made no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the
calendar year in which the Salary or STIP Payment commences to be earned that is the basis of the Company Contribution for which an election is
being made, in accordance with such procedures established by the Company in its sole discretion.
(2)    Initial Eligibility. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(1), an Eligible Employee that is newly eligible to participate in the Plan (or in any Aggregated Plan)
must make an election regarding whether distributions shall be made in a lump-sum or installments, as provided in Section 6.02. Such election must
be made within thirty (30) days after he or she first becomes an Eligible Employee (or within such other earlier deadline as may be established by the
Company, in its sole discretion) but only with respect to Company Contributions attributable to Salary and STIP Payments that are paid with respect to
services performed after such election is made; provided, however, that for this purpose only such thirty (30) day period shall begin to run on the date
that the Eligible Employee first becomes eligible to participate in this Plan (or, if earlier, any Aggregated Plan). In the event an Eligible Employee fails
to timely make such election, Section 6.01(2) shall apply. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Company Contributions shall be earned
or made to a newly Eligible Employee’s Account with respect to service performed prior to the earlier of (1) the day after the Eligible Employee
returns an initial election pursuant to Section 6.03(2) or (2) 31 days after the individual first qualifies as an Eligible Employee.
4    
PG&E Corpr9oar on
(3)    Performance-Based Compensation. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(1), with respect to             STIP Payments that qualify as “Performance-Based
Compensation,” the Company may, in         its sole discretion, permit an election pertaining to Company Contributions attributable to         such Performance-
Based Compensation to be made no later than six (6) months before the         end of the performance service period and in accordance with Code Section
409A. For this         purpose, “Performance-Based Compensation” shall be compensation, the payment or             amount of which is contingent on pre-
established organizational or individual performance         criteria, which satisfies the requirements of Code Section 409A.
6.04    Change in Distribution Election. An Eligible Employee may change a distribution election previously made pursuant to Section 6.02 only in
accordance with the rules under Code Section 409A. Generally, a subsequent election pursuant to this Section 6.04: (1) cannot take effect for twelve (12)
months, (2) must occur at least twelve (12) months before the first scheduled payment, and (3) must defer a previously elected distribution at least five (5)
additional years. The Plan Administrator may establish additional rules or restrictions on changes in distribution elections.
6.05    Death Distributions. If an Eligible Employee dies before the balance of his or her Account has been distributed (whether or not the Eligible Employee
had previously had a Separation from Service), the Eligible Employee’s Account shall be distributed in a single lump sum to the beneficiary designated or
otherwise determined in accordance with Section 6.07, as soon as practicable the date of death (but in any event within 90 days after the date of death).
6.06    Effect of Change in Eligible Employee Status. If an Eligible Employee ceases to be an Eligible Employee but does not experience a Separation from
Service, the balance credited to his or her Account shall continue to be credited (or debited) with appreciation, depreciation, earnings, gains or losses under the
terms of the Plan and shall be distributed to him or her at the time and in the manner set forth in this Section 6.
6.07    Payments to Incompetents. If any individual to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is a minor or if the Plan Administrator determines that any
individual to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is incompetent to receive such payment or to give a valid release therefor, payment shall be made to the
guardian, committee, or other representative of the estate of such individual which has been duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction. If no
guardian, committee, or other representative has been appointed, payment may be made to any person as custodian for such individual under the California
Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (or similar law of another state) or may be made to or applied to or for the benefit of the minor or incompetent, the
incompetent’s spouse, children or other dependents, the institution or persons maintaining the minor or incompetent, or any of them, in such proportions as the
Plan Administrator from time to time shall determine; and the release of the person or institution receiving the payment shall be a valid and complete discharge
of any liability of Company with respect to any benefit so paid.
6.08    Beneficiary Designations. Each Eligible Employee may designate, in a signed writing delivered to the Plan Administrator, on such form or in such
other manner as it may prescribe, one or more beneficiaries to receive any distribution which may become payable under the Plan as the result of the Eligible
Employee’s death. Such an Eligible Employee may designate different beneficiaries at any time by delivering a new designation in like manner. Any
designation shall become effective only upon its receipt by the Plan Administrator, and the last effective designation received by the Plan Administrator shall
supersede all prior designations. If such an Eligible Employee dies without having designated a beneficiary or if no beneficiary survives that Eligible
Employee, that Eligible Employee’s Account shall be payable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated or otherwise determined under the PG&E
Corporation Retirement Savings Plan or any predecessor qualified retirement plan sponsored by Company or any of its subsidiary companies.
6.09    Undistributable Accounts. Each Eligible Employee and (in the event of death) his or her beneficiary shall keep the Plan Administrator advised of his
or her current address. If the Plan Administrator is unable to locate the Eligible Employee or beneficiary to whom an Eligible Employee’s Account is payable
under this Section 6, the Eligible Employee’s Account shall be frozen as of the date on which distribution would have been completed in accordance with this
Section 6, and no further appreciation, depreciation, earnings, gains or losses shall be credited (or debited) thereto. Company shall have the right to assign or
transfer the liability for payment of any undistributable Account to the Eligible Employee’s former Employer (or any successor thereto).
6.10    Plan Administrator Discretion. Within the specific time periods described in this Section 6, the Plan Administrator shall have sole discretion to
determine the specific timing of the payment of any Account balance under the Plan.
Article 7 - Domestic Relations Orders
5    
PG&E Corpr9oar on
7.01    Domestic Relations Orders. The Plan Administrator shall establish written procedures for determining whether a domestic relations order purporting
to dispose of any portion of an Eligible Employee’s Account is a domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code that is acceptable
to the Plan (a “DRO”).
(1)    No Payment Unless a DRO. No payment shall be made to any person designated in a domestic relations order (an “Alternate Payee”) until the
Plan Administrator (or a court of competent jurisdiction reversing an initial adverse determination by the Plan Administrator) determines that the
order is a DRO. Payment shall be made to each Alternate Payee as specified in the DRO.
(2)    Time of Payment. Payment may be made to an Alternate Payee in the form of a lump sum, at the time specified in the DRO, but no earlier than the
date the DRO determination is made by the Plan.
(3)    Hold Procedures. Notwithstanding any contrary Plan provision, prior to the receipt of a domestic relations order, the Plan Administrator may, in its
sole discretion, place a hold upon all or a portion of an Eligible Employee’s Account for a reasonable period of time (as determined by the Plan
Administrator in accordance with Code Section 409A) if the Plan Administrator receives notice that (a) a domestic relations order is being sought by
the Eligible Employee, his or her spouse, former spouse, child or other dependent, and (b) the Eligible Employee’s Account is a source of the payment
under such domestic relations order. For purposes of this Section 7.01, a “hold” means that no withdrawals, distributions, or investment transfers may
be made with respect to an Eligible Employee’s Account. If the Plan Administrator places a hold upon an Eligible Employee’s Account pursuant to
this Section 7.01, it shall inform the Eligible Employee of such fact.
Article 8 - Tax Withholding
Each Eligible Employee shall be responsible for FICA taxes on amounts credited to his or her Account under Section 2. Without limiting the
foregoing, the applicable Employer shall have the right to withhold such amounts from other payments due to the Eligible Employee. Company Contributions
will not be reduced to cover Eligible Employees’ FICA tax liabilities.
The applicable Employer, as applicable, will withhold from other amounts owed to an Eligible Employee or require the Eligible Employee to remit to
Employer, as applicable, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local tax withholding requirements with respect to any Plan benefit or the vesting,
payment or cancellation of any Plan benefit.
Article 9 - Administration of the Plan
9.01    Plan Administrator. The Employee Benefit Committee of Company is hereby designated as the administrator of the Plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(16)(A) of ERISA). The Plan Administrator delegates to the most senior human resource officer for Company, or his or her designee, the authority to
carry out all duties and responsibilities of the Plan Administrator under the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to control and manage the
operation and administration of the Plan.
9.02    Powers of Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall have all discretion and powers necessary to supervise the administration of the Plan and
to control its operation in accordance with its terms, including, but not by way of limitation, the power to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to determine,
in its sole discretion, any question arising under, or in connection with the administration or operation of, the Plan.
9.03    Decisions of Plan Administrator. All decisions of the Plan Administrator and any action taken by it in respect of the Plan and within the powers
granted to it under the Plan shall be conclusive and binding on all persons and shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law.
Article 10 - Modification or Termination of Plan
10.01 Employers’ Obligations Limited. The Plan is voluntary on the part of the Employers, and the Employers do not guarantee to continue the Plan.
Company at any time may, by appropriate amendment of the Plan, or suspend Company Contributions , with or without cause.
10.02    Right to Amend or Terminate. The Board of Directors, acting through the Committee, reserves the right to alter, amend, or terminate the Plan, or any
part thereof, in such manner as it may determine, for any reason whatsoever.
(1)    Limitations. Any alteration, amendment, or termination shall take effect upon the date indicated in the document embodying such alteration,
amendment, or termination, provided that no such alteration or amendment shall divest any portion of an Account that is then vested under the Plan.
(2)    Appendices. Notwithstanding the above, the Plan Administrator may amend the Appendices in its discretion.
6    
PG&E Corpr9oar on
10.03    Effect of Termination. If the Plan is terminated, the balances credited to the Accounts of the Eligible Employees affected by such termination shall be
distributed to them at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 6; provided, however, that the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may authorize
accelerated distribution of Eligible Employees’ Accounts to the extent provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1-409A-3(j)(4)(ix) (A) (relating to
terminations in connection with certain corporate dissolutions), (B) (relating to terminations in connection with certain change of control events), and (C)
(relating to general terminations).
Article 11 - General Provisions
11.01    Inalienability. Except to the extent otherwise directed by a domestic relations order which the Plan Administrator determines is a DRO (as defined in
Section 7.01) or mandated by applicable law, in no event may either an Eligible Employee, a former Eligible Employee or his or her spouse, beneficiary or
estate sell, transfer, anticipate, assign, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of any right or interest under the Plan; and such rights and interests shall not at any
time be subject to the claims of creditors nor be liable to attachment, execution, or other legal process.
11.02    Rights and Duties. Neither the Employers nor the Plan Administrator shall be subject to any liability or duty under the Plan except as expressly
provided in the Plan, or for any action taken, omitted, or suffered in good faith.
11.03    No Enlargement of Employment Rights. Neither the establishment or maintenance of the Plan nor any action of any Employer or Plan
Administrator, shall be held or construed to confer upon any individual any right to be continued as an Employee nor, upon dismissal, any right or interest in
any specific assets of the Employers other than as provided in the Plan. Each Employer expressly reserves the right to discharge any Employee at any time,
with or without cause or advance notice.
11.04.    Apportionment of Costs and Duties. All acts required of the Employers under the Plan may be performed by Company for itself and its Participating
Subsidiaries, and the costs of the Plan may be equitably apportioned by the Plan Administrator among Company and the other Employers. Whenever an
Employer is permitted or required under the terms of the Plan to do or perform any act, matter or thing, it shall be done and performed by any officer or
employee of the Employer who is thereunto duly authorized by the board of directors of the Employer. Each Participating Subsidiary shall be responsible for
making benefit payments pursuant to the Plan on behalf of its Eligible Employees or for reimbursing Company for the cost of such payments, as determined by
Company in its sole discretion. In the event the respective Participating Subsidiary fails to make such payment or reimbursement, and Company does not
exercise its discretion to make the payment on such Participating Subsidiary’s behalf, participation in the Plan by the Eligible Employees of that Participating
Subsidiary shall be suspended in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A. If at some future date, the Participating Subsidiary makes all past-due payments
and reimbursements, plus interest at a rate determined by Company in its sole discretion, the suspended participation of its Eligible Employees eligible to
participate in the Plan will be recognized in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A. In the event the respective Participating Subsidiary fails to make
such payment or reimbursement, an Eligible Employee’s (or other payee’s) sole recourse shall be against the respective Participating Subsidiary, and not
against Company. An Eligible Employee’s participation in the Plan shall constitute agreement with this provision.
11.05    Applicable Law. The provisions of the Plan shall be construed, administered, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California and,
to the extent applicable, ERISA. The Plan is intended to comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A. However, Company makes no representation that
the benefits provided under the Plan will comply with Code Section 409A and makes no undertaking to prevent Code Section 409A from applying to the
benefits provided under the Plan or to mitigate its effects on any deferrals or payments made under the Plan.
11.06    Severability. If any provision of the Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, its invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the
Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included.
11.07    Captions. The captions contained in and the table of contents prefixed to the Plan are inserted only as a matter of convenience and for reference and in
no way define, limit, enlarge, or describe the scope or intent of the Plan nor in any way shall affect the construction of any provision of the Plan.

3.    Employer Contributions.
(a)    Matching Employer Contributions. Subject to the provisions of Section 13, the Eligible Employee’s Account shall be credited for each Plan Year
with a Matching Employer Contribution, calculated in the manner provided in Sections 3(a)(1), (2), and (3) below:
(1)    First, an amount shall be calculated equal to the maximum matching contribution that would be made under the terms of the RSP, taking
into account for such Plan Year the amount of pre-tax deferrals and after-tax contributions the Eligible Employee elected under the RSP. For purposes of this

calculated in accordance with Sections 3(a)(1) and (2) above, reduced by the amount of matching contribution made to such Eligible Employee’s account for
such Plan Year under the RSP.
(b)    Crediting of Matching Employer Contributions. Matching Employer Contributions shall be calculated and credited to the Eligible Employee’s
Account as of the first business day of February of the calendar year following the Plan Year and shall be credited only if the Eligible Employee was an
Eligible Employee on at least one day of the Plan Year for which the amounts are credited, except that if an Eligible Employee Separates from Service on or
after September 15, 2015, then upon that Eligible Employee’s Separation from Service, the value of the Matching Employer Contribution for the Plan Year
during which Separation from Service occurs shall instead be calculated and credited to the Eligible Employee’s Account as soon as practicable, as determined
by PG&E CORP. All such amounts shall be deemed to be invested in an Investment Fund designated by the Plan Administrator.
(c)    Basic Employer Contributions. Subject to the provisions of Section 13, the Account of each Eligible Employee shall be credited for each Plan
Year with a Basic Employer Contribution, calculated in the manner provided in Sections 3(c)(1), (2), and (3) below:
(1)    First, an amount shall be calculated equal to the Basic Employer Contribution that would be made under the terms of the RSP, taking
into account for such Plan Year the Eligible Employee’s Covered Compensation under the RSP, before any deductions for compensation deferrals elected by
such Eligible Employee under Subsection 4(a) of this Plan. For Eligible Employees as defined by Section 2(e)(1) of this Plan, compensation shall also reflect
such Eligible Employee’s Short-Term Incentive Plan awards.
(2)    The calculation made in accordance with this Section 3(c)(1) above shall be made without regard to any limitation on such amounts
under the RSP resulting from the application of any of the limitations under Code Sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(17), or 415.
(3)    The Employer Contribution to be credited to the Account of an Eligible Employee for any Plan Year shall equal the amount calculated
in accordance with Sections 3(c)(1) and (2) above, reduced by the amount of Basic Employer Contributions made to such Eligible Employee’s account for such
Plan Year under the RSP.
(d)    Crediting of Basic Employer Contributions. The Employer Contribution attributable to an Eligible Employee’s Short Term Incentive Plan award
shall be credited to an Eligible Employee’s Account as of the first business day of the month following the date on which the Short-Term Incentive Plan award
is paid. All other Employer Contributions made in respect of an Eligible Employee shall be credited to the Eligible Employee’s Account as of the first business
day of February of the calendar year following the Plan Year and shall be credited only if the Eligible Employee is an Employee on the last day of the Plan Year
for which the amounts are credited . All such amounts shall be deemed to be invested in an Investment Fund designated by the Plan Administrator.
(e)    FICA Taxes. Each Eligible Employee shall be responsible for FICA taxes on amounts credited to his or her Account under Sections 3 and 4(d).
3
4.    Eligible Employee Deferrals.
(a)    Amount of Deferral. An Eligible Employee may defer all or part of his or her annual salary, Short Term Incentive Plan awards, Long-Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards (other than stock options), Perquisite Allowances, and any other special payments, awards, or bonuses as authorized by the Plan
Administrator.
(b)    Credits to Accounts. Salary deferrals shall be credited to an Eligible Employee’s Account as of each payroll period. All other deferrals
attributable to allowances, awards, bonuses, and other payments shall be credited as soon as practicable, but no more than 30 days after the date that they
otherwise would have been paid.
(c)    Deferral Election. An Eligible Employee must file an election form with the Plan Administrator which indicates the percentage of salary and the
amount of any awards, allowances, payments, and bonuses to be deferred under the Plan. The election shall occur no later than December 31 (or such earlier
date established by the Plan Administrator) of the calendar year next preceding the service year (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-
2(a)(3)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(a)(7), upon first becoming an Eligible Employee,
an election to defer shall be effective for compensation to be earned for services performed beginning in the month following the filing of a Deferral Election
Form, provided said Form is filed within 30 days following the date when the employee first becomes an Eligible Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the case of performance-based compensation (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(e)), the election may be made with respect to such
performance-based compensation on or before the date that is six months before the end of the applicable performance period to the extent permitted under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(a)(8). The Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit elections to be made under other timing rules that
comply with Code Section 409A.
(d)    Deferral of Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums. All of an Eligible Employee’s Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums are
automatically deferred to the Plan immediately upon grant and converted into units in the PG&E Corporation Phantom Stock Fund. The units attributable to
Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums and any additional units resulting from the conversion of dividend equivalents thereon remain unvested until the
earlier of the third anniversary of the date on which the Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums are credited to an Eligible Employee’s account (provided
the Eligible Employee continues to be employed on such date), death, disability (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code), or
Retirement of the participant, or upon a Change in Control (as defined in the LTIP). Unvested units attributable to Special Incentive Stock Ownership
Premiums and any additional units resulting from the conversion of dividend equivalents thereon shall be forfeited upon termination of the Eligible Employee’s
employment (unless otherwise provided in the PG&E Corporation Executive Stock Ownership Program or the PG&E Corporation Officer Severance Plan) or if
an Eligible Employee’s stock ownership falls below the levels set forth in the Executive Stock Ownership Program.
5.    Investment Funds. Although no assets will be segregated or otherwise set aside with respect to an Eligible Employee’s Account, the amount that is
ultimately payable to the Eligible Employee with respect to such Account shall be determined as if such Account had been invested in some or all of the
Investment Funds. The Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall adopt (and modify from time to time) such rules and procedures as it deems necessary or
appropriate to implement the deemed investment of the Eligible Employees’ Accounts. Such procedures generally shall provide that an Eligible Employee’s
Account shall be deemed to be invested among the available Investment Funds in the manner elected by the Eligible Employee in such percentages and manner
as prescribed by the Plan Administrator. In the event no election has been made by the Eligible Employee, such Account will be deemed to be invested in an
Investment Fund designated by the Plan Administrator. Eligible Employees shall be able to reallocate their Accounts between the Investment Funds and
reallocate amounts newly credited to their Accounts at such time and in such manner as the Plan Administrator shall prescribe. Anything to the contrary herein
notwithstanding, an Eligible Employee may not reallocate Account balances between Investment Funds if such reallocation would result in a non-exempt
Discretionary Transaction as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor to Rule 16b-3, as in effect when the
reallocation is requested. The available Investment Funds shall be listed on Appendix B and may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors.
6.    Accounting.
(a)    Eligible Employees’ Accounts. At the direction of the Plan Administrator, there shall be established and maintained on the books of the
Employer, a separate account for each Eligible Employee in order to reflect his or her interest under the Plan.
(b)    Investment Earnings. Each Eligible Employee’s Account shall initially reflect the value of his or her Account’s interest in each of the Investment
Funds, deemed acquired with the amounts credited thereto. Each
4
Eligible Employee’s Account shall also be credited (or debited) with the net appreciation (or depreciation), earnings and gains (or losses) with respect to the
investments deemed made by his or her Account. Any such net earnings or gains deemed realized with respect to any investment of any Eligible Employee’s
Account shall be deemed reinvested in additional amounts of the same investment and credited to the Eligible Employee’s Account.
(c)    Accounting Methods. The accounting methods or formulae to be used under the Plan for the purpose of maintaining the Eligible Employees’
Accounts shall be determined by the Plan Administrator. The accounting methods or formulae selected by the Plan Administrator may be revised from time to
time but shall conform to the extent practicable with the accounting methods used under the Applicable Plan.
(d)    Valuations and Reports. The fair market value of each Eligible Employee’s Account shall be determined as of each Valuation Date. In making
such determinations and in crediting net deemed earnings and gains (or losses) in the Investment Funds to the Eligible Employees’ Accounts, the Plan
Administrator (in its discretion) may employ such accounting methods as the Plan Administrator (in its discretion) may deem appropriate in order to fairly
reflect the fair market values of the Investment Funds and each Eligible Employee’s Account. For this purpose, the Plan Administrator may rely upon
information provided by the Plan Administrator or other persons believed by the Plan Administrator to be competent.
(e)    Statements of Eligible Employee’s Accounts. Each Eligible Employee shall be furnished with periodic statements of his or her interest in the
Plan.
7.    Distributions.
(a)    Distribution of Account Balances. Except to the extent the Eligible Employee has elected otherwise under this Section 7 at the time of deferral,
distribution of the balance credited to an Eligible Employee’s Account shall be made in a single lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event
within 90 days) following the date that is seven (7) months following Separation from Service.
    In the case of an Alternate Payee (as defined in Section 9(a), to the extent allowable under Code Section 409A, distribution shall be made as directed in a
domestic relations order which the Plan Administrator determines is a DRO (as defined in Section 9(a), but only as to the portion of the Eligible Employee’s
Account which the DRO states is payable to the Alternate Payee.
(b)    Specific Distributions. In lieu of a payment described in Section 7(a), by filing an irrevocable election with the Plan Administrator, an Eligible
Employee may at the time of deferral elect to receive distribution of the specific type of income deferral for that calendar year plus the earnings thereon
(exclusive of Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums) in, or in the case of installments commencing in, January of any future year and in the form of
either (1) a single lump sum or (2) from two to ten annual installments with subsequent installments paid on each anniversary of the installment
commencement date.
(c)    Election of Installment Payments. In lieu of a single sum payment under Section 7(a), except in the case of Special Incentive Stock Ownership
Premiums, an Eligible Employee may elect in writing to the Plan Administrator, on such form or in such other manner as it may prescribe, and file with the
Plan Administrator an election that payment of amounts credited to the Eligible Employee’s Account be made in from 2 to 10 equal annual installments. If the
Eligible Employee elects installment payments pursuant to this Section 7(c), then such installment payments shall commence as soon as reasonably practicable
(but in any event within 90 days) following the date that is seven (7) months following Separation from Service (“Benefit Commencement Date”) and
subsequent installments will be paid on each anniversary of the Benefit Commencement Date thereof until all installments are paid.
(d)    Change in Distribution Election. An Eligible Employee may change a distribution election previously made pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) (or
in place by default pursuant to Section 7(a)) only with respect to the portion of the Eligible Employee’s Account attributable to Eligible Employee Deferrals
(exclusive of Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums) and only in accordance with the rules under Code Section 409A. Generally, a subsequent election
pursuant to this Section 7(d): (1) cannot take effect for twelve (12) months, (2) must occur at least twelve (12) months before the first scheduled payment under
a payment at a specified date elected pursuant to Section 7(b), and (3) must defer a previously elected distribution at least five (5) additional years. The Plan
Administrator may establish additional rules or restrictions on changes in distribution elections.
(e)    Death Distributions. If an Eligible Employee dies before the balance of his or her Account has been distributed (whether or not the Eligible
Employee had previously had a Separation from Service), the Eligible Employee’s Account shall be distributed in a lump sum to the beneficiary designated or
otherwise determined in
5
accordance with Section 7, as soon as practicable after the date of death (but in any event within 90 days after the date of death).
(f)    Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums. Distributions attributable to Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums shall only be made in
the form of one or more certificates for the number of vested Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premium units, rounded down to the nearest whole share, in
accordance with the timing rule set forth in Section 7(a).
(g)    Effect of Change in Eligible Employee Status. If an Eligible Employee ceases to be an Eligible Employee but does not experience a Separation
from Service, the balance credited to his or her Account shall continue to be credited (or debited) with appreciation, depreciation, earnings, gains or losses
under the terms of the Plan and shall be distributed to him or her at the time and in the manner set forth in this Section 7.
(h)    Payments to Incompetents. If any individual to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is a minor or if the Plan Administrator determines that
any individual to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is incompetent to receive such payment or to give a valid release therefor, payment shall be made to
the guardian, committee, or other representative of the estate of such individual which has been duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction. If no
guardian, committee, or other representative has been appointed, payment may be made to any person as custodian for such individual under the California
Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (or similar law of another state) or may be made to or applied to or for the benefit of the minor or incompetent, the
incompetent’s spouse, children or other dependents, the institution or persons maintaining the minor or incompetent, or any of them, in such proportions as the
Plan Administrator from time to time shall determine; and the release of the person or institution receiving the payment shall be a valid and complete discharge
of any liability of PG&E CORP with respect to any benefit so paid.
(i)    Beneficiary Designations. Each Eligible Employee may designate, in a signed writing delivered to the Plan Administrator, on such form as it may
prescribe, one or more beneficiaries to receive any distribution which may become payable under the Plan as the result of the Eligible Employee’s death. An
Eligible Employee may designate different beneficiaries at any time by delivering a new designation in like manner. Any designation shall become effective
only upon its receipt by the Plan Administrator, and the last effective designation received by the Plan Administrator shall supersede all prior designations. If an
Eligible Employee dies without having designated a beneficiary or if no beneficiary survives the Eligible Employee, the Eligible Employee’s Account shall be
payable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated or otherwise determined under the RSP.
(j)    Undistributable Accounts. Each Eligible Employee and (in the event of death) his or her beneficiary shall keep the Plan Administrator advised of
his or her current address. If the Plan Administrator is unable to locate the Eligible Employee or beneficiary to whom an Eligible Employee’s Account is
payable under this Section 7, the Eligible Employee’s Account shall be frozen as of the date on which distribution would have been completed in accordance
with this Section 7, and no further appreciation, depreciation, earnings, gains or losses shall be credited (or debited) thereto. PG&E CORP shall have the right
to assign or transfer the liability for payment of any undistributable Account to the Eligible Employee’s former Employer (or any successor thereto).
    (k)    Plan Administrator Discretion. Within the specific time periods described in this Section 7, the Plan Administrator shall have sole discretion to
determine the specific timing of the payment of any Account balance under the Plan.
8.    Distribution Due to Unforeseeable Emergency (Hardship Distribution). A participant may request a distribution due to an unforeseeable emergency (within
the meaning of Code Section 409A) by submitting a written request to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to require such
evidence as it deems necessary to determine if a distribution is warranted. If an application for a hardship distribution due to an unforeseeable emergency is
approved, the distribution shall be payable in a lump sum within 30 days after approval of such distribution. After receipt of a payment requested due to an
unforeseeable emergency, a participant may not make additional deferrals during the remainder of the Plan Year in which the recipient received the payment.
The distribution due to an unforeseeable emergency shall not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to meet the emergency. This Section 8 shall be
administered in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
9.    Domestic Relations Orders.
(a)    Domestic Relations Orders. The Plan Administrator shall establish written procedures for determining whether an order purporting to dispose of
any portion of an Eligible Employee’s Account is a domestic relations order (within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code) (a “DRO”).
6
(1)    No Payment Unless a DRO. No payment shall be made to any person designated in an order (an “Alternate Payee”) until the Plan
Administrator (or a court of competent jurisdiction reversing an initial adverse determination by the Plan Administrator) determines that the order is a DRO.
Payment shall be made to each Alternate Payee as specified in the DRO.
(2)    Time of Payment. Payment may be made to an Alternate Payee in the form of a lump sum, at the time specified in the DRO, but no
earlier than the date the DRO determination is made.
(3)    Hold Procedures. Notwithstanding any contrary Plan provision, prior to the receipt of a domestic relations order, the Plan Administrator
may, in its sole discretion, place a hold upon all or a portion of an Eligible Employee’s Account for a reasonable period of time (as determined by the Plan
Administrator in accordance with Code Section 409A) if the Plan Administrator receives notice that (a) a domestic relations order is being sought by the
Eligible Employee, his or her spouse, former spouse, child or other dependent, and (b) the Eligible Employee’s Account is a source of the payment under such
domestic relations order. For purposes of this Section 9(a)(3), a “hold” means that no withdrawals, distributions, or investment transfers may be made with
respect to an Eligible Employee’s Account. If the Plan Administrator places a hold upon an Eligible Employee’s Account pursuant to this Section 9(a)(3), it
shall inform the Eligible Employee of such fact.
10.    Vesting. Except as provided in Section 4(d), an Eligible Employee’s interest in his or her Account at all times shall be 100 percent vested and
nonforfeitable.
11.    Administration of the Plan.
(a)    Plan Administrator. The Employee Benefit Committee of PG&E CORP is hereby designated as the administrator of the Plan (within the meaning
of Section 3(16)(A) of ERISA). The Plan Administrator delegates to the Senior Human Resource Officer for PG&E CORP, or his or her designee, the authority
to carry out all duties and responsibilities of the Plan Administrator under the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to control and manage the
operation and administration of the Plan.
(b)    Powers of Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall have all discretion and powers necessary to supervise the administration of the Plan
and to control its operation in accordance with its terms, including, but not by way of limitation, the power to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to
determine, in its sole discretion, any question arising under, or in connection with the administration or operation of, the Plan.
(c)    Decisions of Plan Administrator. All decisions of the Plan Administrator and any action taken by it in respect of the Plan and within the powers
granted to it under the Plan shall be conclusive and binding on all persons and shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law.
12.    Funding. All amounts credited to an Eligible Employee’s Account under the Plan shall continue for all purposes to be a part of the general assets of PG&E
CORP. The interest of the Eligible Employee in his or her Account, including his or her right to distribution thereof, shall be an unsecured claim against the
general assets of PG&E CORP. While PG&E CORP may choose to invest a portion of its general assets in investments identical or similar to those selected by
Eligible Employees for purposes of determining the amounts to be credited (or debited) to their Accounts, nothing contained in the Plan shall give any Eligible
Employee or beneficiary any interest in or claim against any specific assets of PG&E CORP.
13.    Modification or Termination of Plan.
(a)    Employers’ Obligations Limited. The Plan is voluntary on the part of the Employers, and the Employers do not guarantee to continue the Plan.
PG&E CORP at any time may, by appropriate amendment of the Plan, suspend Matching Employer Contributions and/or Basic Employer Contributions or may
discontinue Matching Employer Contributions and/or Basic Employer Contributions, with or without cause.
(b)    Right to Amend or Terminate. The Board of Directors, acting through the Committee, reserves the right to alter, amend, or terminate the Plan, or
any part thereof, in such manner as it may determine, for any reason whatsoever.
(1)    Limitations. Any alteration, amendment, or termination shall take effect upon the date indicated in the document embodying such
alteration, amendment, or termination, provided that no such alteration or amendment shall divest any portion of an Account that is then vested under the Plan.
7
(c)    Effect of Termination. If the Plan is terminated, the balances credited to the Accounts of the Eligible Employees affected by such termination
shall be distributed to them at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 7; provided, however, that the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may
authorize accelerated distribution of Eligible Employees’ Accounts to the extent provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1-409A-3(j)(4)(ix) (A) (relating to
terminations in connection with certain corporate dissolutions), (B) (relating to terminations in connection with certain change of control events), and (C)
(relating to general terminations).
14.    General Provisions.
(a)    Inalienability. Except to the extent otherwise directed by a domestic relations order which the Plan Administrator determines is a DRO (as
defined in Section 9(a)) or mandated by applicable law, in no event may either an Eligible Employee, a former Eligible Employee or his or her spouse,
beneficiary or estate sell, transfer, anticipate, assign, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of any right or interest under the Plan; and such rights and interests shall
not at any time be subject to the claims of creditors nor be liable to attachment, execution, or other legal process.
(b)    Rights and Duties. Neither the Employers nor the Plan Administrator shall be subject to any liability or duty under the Plan except as expressly
provided in the Plan, or for any action taken, omitted, or suffered in good faith.
(c)    No Enlargement of Employment Rights. Neither the establishment or maintenance of the Plan, the making of any Matching Employer
Contributions, nor any action of any Employer or Plan Administrator, shall be held or construed to confer upon any individual any right to be continued as an
Employee nor, upon dismissal, any right or interest in any specific assets of the Employers other than as provided in the Plan. Each Employer expressly
reserves the right to discharge any Employee at any time, with or without cause or advance notice.
(d)    Apportionment of Costs and Duties. All acts required of the Employers under the Plan may be performed by PG&E CORP for itself and its
Participating Subsidiaries, and the costs of the Plan may be equitably apportioned by the Plan Administrator among PG&E CORP and the other Employers.
Whenever an Employer is permitted or required under the terms of the Plan to do or perform any act, matter or thing, it shall be done and performed by any
officer or employee of the Employer who is thereunto duly authorized by the board of directors of the Employer. Each Participating Subsidiary shall be
responsible for making benefit payments pursuant to the Plan on behalf of its Eligible Employees or for reimbursing PG&E CORP for the cost of such
payments, as determined by PG&E CORP in its sole discretion. In the event the respective Participating Subsidiary fails to make such payment or
reimbursement, and PG&E CORP does not exercise its discretion to make the payment on such Participating Subsidiary’s behalf, participation in the Plan by
the Eligible Employees of that Participating Subsidiary shall be suspended in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A. If at some future date, the
Participating Subsidiary makes all past-due payments and reimbursements, plus interest at a rate determined by PG&E CORP in its sole discretion, the
suspended participation of its Eligible Employees eligible to participate in the Plan will be recognized in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A. In the
event the respective Participating Subsidiary fails to make such payment or reimbursement, an Eligible Employee’s (or other payee’s) sole recourse shall be
against the respective Participating Subsidiary, and not against PG&E CORP. An Eligible Employee’s participation in the Plan shall constitute agreement with
this provision.
(e)    Applicable Law. The provisions of the Plan shall be construed, administered, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California
and, to the extent applicable, ERISA. The Plan is intended to comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A. However, PG&E CORP makes no
representation that the benefits provided under the Plan will comply with Code Section 409A and makes no undertaking to prevent Code Section 409A from
applying to the benefits provided under the Plan or to mitigate its effects on any deferrals or payments made under the Plan.
(f)    Severability. If any provision of the Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, its invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of
the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included.
(g)    Captions. The captions contained in and the table of contents prefixed to the Plan are inserted only as a matter of convenience and for reference
and in no way define, limit, enlarge, or describe the scope or intent of the Plan nor in any way shall affect the construction of any provision of the Plan.

APPENDIX B
INVESTMENT FUNDS
(as of August 1, 2011)
SRSP Target Date Funds are a suite of funds that provides investors with convenient, cost-effective exposure across major global asset classes within single
investment options. The suite consists of ten funds targeting a normal retirement age of 65. These broadly diversified vehicles combine low-cost stock and
bond strategies and automatic rebalancing with professional judgment regarding the appropriate risk level for a specific retirement date. On an annual basis, the
SRSP Target Date Funds incrementally reduce exposure to equities and increase exposure to fixed income assets as the target retirement date approaches. This
equity roll down continues for five years after the target retirement date, at which time a fixed income-oriented allocation of 65% is combined with 35% stocks
that is maintained indefinitely within the RSP Target Retirement Income Fund. A participant typically invests in one fund within the suite which fund reflects a
target retirement date closest to the anticipated retirement date of the participant.
PG&E Corporation Phantom Stock Fund converts contributions and transferred amounts into units of phantom common stock valued at the closing price of
a share of PG&E Corporation common stock on the contribution/transfer date. If the transfer request is received after the market closes, the following day’s
closing price will be used. Thereafter, the value of a unit shall fluctuate depending on the price of PG&E Corporation common stock. Each time a dividend is
paid on common stock, an amount equal to such dividend shall be credited to the account as additional units.
SRSP Total US Stock Index Fund seeks to match the returns of the Russell 3000 Index. The Russell 3000 Index represents the 3,000 largest stocks in the US
market and accounts for approximately 97% of the US stock market’s capitalization. The strategy of investing in the same stocks as the Russell 3000 Index
provides reliable exposure to this asset class and results in lower expenses.
SRSP Large Company Stock Index Fund seeks to match the returns of the S&P 500 Index. The Fund invests in all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 Index in
proportion to their weightings in the Index. The S&P 500 provides exposure to about 85% of the market value of all publicly traded common stocks in the
United States. The strategy of investing in the same stocks as the S&P 500 Index provides reliable exposure to this asset class and results in lower expenses.
SRSP Small Company Stock Index Fund seeks to match the returns of the Russell Small Cap Completeness Index. The Fund invests in all of the stocks in
the Russell Special Small Cap Completeness Index in proportion to their weightings in the Index. The Russell Small Cap Completeness Index represents about
15% of the market value of all publicly traded common stocks in the United States. The strategy of investing in the same stocks as the Russell Small Cap
Completeness Index provides reliable exposure to this asset class and results in lower expenses.
SRSP World Stock Index Fund seeks to match the returns of the MSCI All Country World Index over the long term. The MSCI All Country World Index
invests in the US, Canada, Europe, Australasia and Far East countries and emerging markets. The strategy of investing in a portfolio of stocks designed to track
the MSCI All Country World Ex-US Index provides reliable exposure to this asset class and results in lower expenses.
SRSP International Stock Index Fund seeks to match the returns of the MSCI World ex-US Index. The Fund invests in all of the stocks in the MSCI World
ex-US Index in proportion to their weightings in the Index. The MSCI World ex-US index provides exposure to Canada as well as developed market countries
in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. The strategy of investing in the same stocks as the MSCI World ex-US provides reliable exposure to this asset class
and results in lower expenses.
SRSP Emerging Markets Enhanced Index Fund seeks to provide a total investment return in excess of the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index over the long term. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index invests in emerging market countries. The strategy attempts to identify and capitalize on
inefficiencies in the emerging markets by employing a disciplined investment process that combines top-down country selection with bottom-up stock selection
to determine an optimal country and security mix. Portfolio construction is risk-controlled, with the goal of a well-diversified portfolio that has characteristics
similar to the benchmark and superior performance potential.
SRSP Bond Index Fund seeks to match the returns of the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. The Fund invests in a portfolio of government, corporate,
mortgage-backed, and asset-backed fixed-income securities that is representative of the broad domestic bond market. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond
Index is an unmanaged,
market-value weighted index of investment-grade, fixed-rate debt issues, including government, corporate, asset-backed, and mortgage-backed securities, with
maturities of one year or more. The strategy of investing in a portfolio of bonds designed to track the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index provides reliable
exposure to this asset class and results in lower expenses.
SRSP US Government Bond Index Fund seeks to match the returns of the Barclays Capital US Government Bond Index. The Fund invests in a well-
diversified portfolio that is representative of the Barclays Capital US Government Bond Index, which consists of US Government and government agency
securities (other than mortgage securities) with maturities of one year or more. The strategy of investing in a portfolio of stocks designed to track the Barclays
Capital US Government Index provides reliable exposure to this asset class and results in lower expenses.
SRSP Money Market Investment Fund is maintained for the purpose of investing in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of short-term government
and non-government debt securities. The primary objective of this fund is to provide participants with preservation of principal.
Short-Term Bond Index Fund is maintained for the purpose of investing in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of short-term, marketable fixed-income
securities.
AA Utility Bond Fund accrues interest on the amount invested in this fund. The interest rate is equal to the AA Utility Bond Yield reported by Moody’s
Investor Services.

PG&E CORPORATION
SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
(As adopted effective January 19, 2022)
1.    Purpose
Effective as of January 19, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), PG&E Corporation adopted this Short-Term Incentive Plan is to motivate and reward eligible
officers and other employees of PG&E Corporation (or its successor) and its Participating Subsidiaries, and other designated participants, with
financial incentives if they meet or exceed certain goals. The Plan was amended February 15, 2023 to reflect that, for performance periods starting on
or after January 1, 2023, eligible participants must be employed on the pay-out date. The Plan is intended to be a bonus arrangement exempt from the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and is not primarily intended to systematically defer payment until the termination of
covered employment or beyond or to provide retirement income.

2
4.    Eligibility and Participation
Any individual who is a Participant on the first day of the relevant Performance Period or, if later, the first day of employment with the Group as a
Participant, shall be eligible to participate in the Plan, and shall participate in the Plan as determined at the sole discretion of the Administrator (or
appropriate delegate).
5.    Amount of Awards
5.1    With respect to each Participant, the Administrator (or appropriate delegate, and subject to applicable laws and requirements established by the
Board) shall establish and communicate in writing one or more Performance Periods and one or more Performance Goals (including, if
applicable and without limitation, threshold, target, and maximum Performance Goals, as well as individual modifiers).
5.2    The amount of each Award shall be determined by the Administrator (or appropriate delegate, and subject to applicable laws and requirements
established by the Board) based on the extent to which the Performance Goals have been met.
5.3    The Administrator (or appropriate delegate, and subject to applicable laws and requirements established by the Board) reserves the right, in its
sole discretion, to adjust, upward or downward, including to $0, the amount of an Award otherwise payable to a Participant with respect to
any Performance Period, including adjusting the amount to reflect individual performance.
6.    Payment of Awards
6.1    Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator (or appropriate delegate) and except as otherwise set forth in Section 6.2 below, in order to
receive payment of an Award, a Participant must have been employed by the Group at the end of the associated Performance Period. For
Performance Periods starting on or after January 1, 2023, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator (or appropriate delegate) and
except as otherwise set forth in Section 6.2 below, in order to receive payment of an Award, a Participant must be employed by the Group on
the pay-out date.
6.2    Notwithstanding Section 6.1 above, and unless otherwise determined by the Administrator (or appropriate delegate) and subject to Section 8:
(a)    If a Participant Retires during a Performance Period, that Participant will remain eligible for a pro-rated associated Award payment
based on the portion of that Performance Period during which the Participant was employed, based on Administrator (or appropriate
delegate) approval of the Plan and Award, actual corporate performance, and achievement of the Performance Goals through the end
of the applicable Performance Period.
(b)    Unless otherwise set forth in an applicable formal severance plan, policy, program, or agreement if a Participant who has been
employed by the Group for at least six (6) months of the Performance Period is involuntarily terminated from employment with the
Group during such Performance Period pursuant to a formal severance plan, policy, or program, such as a targeted voluntary
severance program, or as a termination other than for cause (or term of similar import) under a severance policy or agreement, that
Participant will remain eligible for a pro-rated associated Award payment based on the portion of that Performance Period during
which the Participant was employed, based on Administrator (or appropriate delegate) approval of the Plan and Award, actual
corporate performance, and achievement of the Performance Goals through the end of the applicable Performance Period.
(c)    If a Participant’s employment is terminated due to death or disability during a Performance Period, then the Participant or the
Participant’s estate or legal representative, as applicable, will be eligible for a pro-rated associated Award payment based on the
portion of the Performance Period during which the Participant was employed, based on Administrator (or appropriate delegate)
approval of the Plan and Award, actual corporate performance, and achievement of the Performance Goals through the end of the
applicable Performance period.
3
Any payment pursuant to this Section 6.2 will be made when payments under the Plan are otherwise made to Participants.
6.3    It is intended that participation in the Plan will not give rise to a “legally binding right” (within the meaning of Section 409A) to compensation
and will, therefore, be exempt from the application of Section 409A. To the extent not so exempt, payments under the Plan shall be made
within two months and 15 days following the end of the calendar year in which such payments cease to be subject to a “substantial risk of
forfeiture,” within the meaning of Section 409A. In the event that the Corporation’s taxable year ceases to be the calendar year, then
payments under the Plan shall be made within two months and 15 days following the later of the end of the calendar year or the Corporation’s
taxable year in which such payments cease to be subject to a “substantial risk of forfeiture,” within the meaning of Section 409A.
6.4    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, any payment hereunder shall be subject to potential cancellation, recovery,
repayment, or other action in accordance with the terms of any Clawback Policy. By accepting an Award, the relevant Participant agrees and
consents to the enforcement and implementation of the Clawback Policy without further consent or action being required of the Participant.
7.    General
7.1    Tax Withholding. Payments under the Plan are subject to deduction for any federal, state, or local income and payroll taxes required by law to
be withheld with respect to such payments. The Group also may withhold from any other amount payable hereunder to the Participant an
amount equal to the taxes required to be withheld with respect to any payment under the Plan.
7.2    Claim to Awards and Employment Rights. Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon any Participant the right to continued employment with the
Group, or affect in any way the right of any member of the Group to terminate the Participant’s employment at any time and for any reason,
or to change the Participant’s responsibilities. Awards represent unfunded and unsecured obligations of the Group, and a holder of any right
hereunder in respect of any Award shall have no rights other than those of a general unsecured creditor to the Group.
    
7.3    Nontransferability. A person’s rights and interests under the Plan, including any Award previously made to such person or any amounts payable
under the Plan, may not be assigned, pledged, or transferred except, in the event of a Participant’s death, by will, trust or the laws of descent
and distribution, or by court order.
7.4    Indemnification. In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of the Board or the Committee or as officers
or employees of the Group, members of the Board or the Committee and any officers or employees of the Group to whom authority to act for
the Board, the Committee or the Corporation is delegated shall be indemnified by the Corporation against all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys’ fees, actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any
appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the
Plan, or any right granted hereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by
independent legal counsel selected by the Corporation) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding,
except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such person is liable for gross negligence,
bad faith or intentional misconduct in duties; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the institution of such action, suit or
proceeding, such person shall offer to the Corporation, in writing, the opportunity at its own expense to handle and defend the same.
7.5    Expenses. The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by participating companies in the Group, and may be equitably
apportioned by the Administrator among companies within the Group. Each company whose officers or other employees are granted awards
under the Plan shall be responsible for making payments pursuant to the Plan on behalf of Participants employed by that company, or for
reimbursing the Corporation for the cost of such payments, as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. In the event that a
company fails to make payment or reimbursement and the Corporation does not exercise its discretion to make the payment on such
participating company’s behalf, a Participant’s (or other payee’s) sole recourse shall be against that Participant’s employer. 
4
7.6    Titles and Headings. The titles and headings of the sections of the Plan are for convenience of reference only, and in the event of any conflict,
the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.
7.7    Governing Law. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and any Award shall be
determined in accordance with the laws of the State of California (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof) and
applicable Federal law.
8.    Amendments, Suspension, or Termination of the Plan
The Administrator may, at any time, or from time to time, amend or suspend and, if suspended, reinstate, the Plan in whole or in part. The
Administrator may terminate the Plan at any time, provided such termination shall not affect the payment of any Awards with respect to a Performance
Period that was completed by the Participant prior to the date of the termination.

(c)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, individuals who previously received a lump sum cash payment under Section 3.01(b) of the
PLAN that was not coded as a “Postretirement Life Insurance Plan” payment in the payroll records of the COMPANY, and who continued to receive
communications regarding a continuing PLAN benefit, may elect to purchase supplemental life insurance under the PLAN; provided that, each such
individual enters into, and continues to abide by the terms of, an agreement with the EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COMMITTEE setting forth the terms of
such purchase.

Section 01
Foreword
A MESSAGE FROM PATTI POPPE
PG&E Team, 
 
Our Purpose at PG&E is delivering for our hometowns, serving our planet and leading with love. That’s our responsibility, both as a
team and as individuals. 
 
Fulfilling our Purpose requires a personal commitment to living our Virtues every day. We will show our Virtue of being trustworthy
by doing our work the right way and with integrity every time.  
 
Our PG&E Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for how we work. I ask that you take time to read it and understand it. More
than that, let’s practice it every day by following both the letter and spirit of our Code of Conduct and all compliance
requirements. Together, we can make it enjoyable to work with and for PG&E. 
 
As part of our Virtue of being curious, we ask questions and notice when something doesn’t seem right. If you ever have concerns
about safety or possible misconduct, talk to your leader immediately or contact any of the resources listed on the Code of Conduct
mobile app or intranet page. 
 
I want each of you to feel safe and supported, especially when speaking up about your ideas and concerns. PG&E’s leadership
team will listen up and follow up by taking action on what you share. It’s also important for you to know that PG&E does not tolerate
retaliation for speaking up or participating in an investigation.  
 
Join me in taking personal ownership of our PG&E Code of Conduct and showing our coworkers, customers and communities that
we are worthy of their trust. 
 
Leading with Love,

Join me in taking personal ownership of our PG&E Code of Conduct and showing our coworkers, customers and communities that
we are worthy of their trust.
(Section 02)
Adhering to our Code of Conduct is critical to carrying out our Purpose, being true to our Virtues, and accomplishing our Stands.
Section 02
PG&E Code of Conduct
Your guide to ethics and compliance
Our Code of Conduct illustrates how we live our Purpose, Virtues and Stands. It reflects who we are. Adhering to our Code of
Conduct is critical to carrying out our Purpose, being true to our Virtues and accomplishing our Stands. This document guides our
overarching commitment to our ethical culture and compliance.
Every PG&E coworker is responsible for complying with the Code, laws and regulations, in all actions. The Code of Conduct is
divided into sections that address:
    Our ethical commitments
    Speak up, listen up, follow up
    Building trust with various stakeholders: with each other, with our business contacts, with our customers and communities,
and with government entities
PG&E does not grant waivers to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct is an addition to, and not a replacement of, regulatory
and legal policies. In a dynamic and fluid business climate, it’s not possible to predict every conceivable situation; so whenever
possible, check the online version of the Code of Conduct for the most current information.
(Section 03)
We take personal responsibility for speaking up, listening up and following up.
Section 03
Our Ethical Commitments
How we do our work matters. We live our Virtues and conduct ourselves in an honest and ethical manner.
ADHERING TO THE CODE OF CONDUCT
How we do our work matters. We live our Virtues and conduct ourselves in an honest and ethical manner. By adhering to the Code
of Conduct, complying with all laws, rules and regulations, and PG&E’s policies, standards and procedures, we build trust with our
customers, stakeholders and each other. We demonstrate ownership by:
    Speaking up, listening up and following up
    Complying with applicable laws, regulations, our Code and PG&E requirements
    Raising questions and concerns if we become aware of possible violations of laws, regulations, our Code or PG&E
requirements
    Cooperating fully when responding to an investigation or audit
    Working and communicating respectfully with everyone
Responsibilities of PG&E Leaders
When in a leadership position, we own additional responsibilities for ethics and compliance, including:
    Building trust and creating an environment that makes it safe for coworkers to speak up to share ideas and concerns
    Recognizing and meeting our commitments with the appropriate degree of urgency
    Encouraging coworkers to raise issues
    Not engaging in retaliation against those who raise issues about safety, violations of laws or regulations, or this Code of
Conduct
    Listening up and following up with coworkers who speak up
    Openly acknowledging when we are wrong or don’t know the answer, and seeking guidance if unsure of the appropriate
course of action
    Escalating and reporting suspected violations of this Code, whether by coworkers or PG&E’s suppliers or business partners,
to the Ethics & Compliance Helpline
    Being an ethical role model—making ethics and compliance a cornerstone of our work
    Making personnel decisions based on merit and performance
AS A PG&E LEADER—
    I will comply with this Code of Conduct and other relevant PG&E policies and standards.
    I won’t direct my coworkers to violate this Code, a law, a regulation or a PG&E policy or procedure.
    I will listen to and follow up with coworkers who raise concerns and escalate appropriately.
    I will promptly report suspected violations of this Code to the Ethics & Compliance Helpline when brought to my attention.
    I won’t retaliate.
    I won’t threaten retaliation.
    I won’t tolerate retaliation if I observe it against another coworker.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I will comply with the laws, regulations and PG&E requirements that apply to my job.
    I will act with integrity at all times.
    I will speak up promptly about possible misconduct, safety issues or new ideas.
    I won’t retaliate.
    I won’t threaten retaliation.
AS A PG&E LEADER—I won’t direct my coworkers to violate this Code, a law, a regulation or a PG&E policy or procedure.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—I will comply with the laws, regulations and PG&E requirements that apply to my job.
MAKING ETHICAL DECISIONS
When faced with an ethical dilemma, ask yourself:
    Have I made sure that my actions will not impact anyone’s safety?
    Is it legal?
    Does it feel right?
    Do I act respectfully and with integrity, and in such a way that if my words or actions were to be made public, I wouldn’t feel
embarrassed or lose the trust of customers, stakeholders or coworkers?
    Is it consistent with our Code, our Virtues and our policies?
    Am I willing to be held accountable for my actions?
Yes
If you answered “yes” to every question, proceed.
No
If you’re not sure, or you answered “no” to any of the questions, don’t proceed.
Ask your leader or the Ethics & Compliance Helpline for guidance. For more information see the How You Can Speak Up section.
Coworkers who don’t comply with this Code or other PG&E policies, standards or procedures may face disciplinary action or
termination of employment. Leaders should contact their HR representative for help determining the appropriate course of action if
a coworker violates the Code of Conduct.
If a safety incident occurs, our primary objective is to learn why it happened and take the necessary steps to put controls in place to
prevent recurrence. Disciplinary action will be considered only if a coworker has acted recklessly, has a pattern of carelessness or
noncompliance, or intentionally violates safety rules or other PG&E policies.
PG&E does not tolerate discipline or retaliation against a coworker for speaking up and raising a safety concern. When you speak
up for safety, you are doing the right thing. Speaking up helps to reduce both the frequency and severity of safety incidents.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—I won’t retaliate or threaten retaliation.
(Section 04)
PG&E is a safer, better enterprise when we speak up, listen up and follow up.
Section 04
Speak Up, Listen Up, Follow Up
When we know about a problem, we can fix it.
SPEAK UP: HOW TO DO IT AND WHY IT MATTERS
At PG&E, we’re committed to fostering a workplace where everyone feels safe to ask for guidance, share ideas or raise concerns—
and one where everyone is confident that those concerns will be heard and taken seriously. When we know about a problem, we
can fix it. In short, PG&E is a safer, better enterprise when we speak up, listen up and follow up.
If you encounter activities at work that you believe may constitute misconduct, including unethical behavior, or a violation of
applicable laws or regulations, speak up immediately to your leader, Human Resources or the Ethics & Compliance (E&C) Helpline.
Leaders have a duty to act when coworkers raise issues about safety or misconduct. Leaders also have a responsibility to listen,
take action and follow up on issues raised by coworkers.
PG&E takes fraud, bribery, corruption and other misconduct seriously. Coworkers who violate this Code of Conduct and suppliers
who violate the Supplier Code of Conduct will be held accountable for their actions. Coworkers who engage in this type of
misconduct are subject to discipline or termination of employment, and may also face criminal prosecution.
You can feel comfortable raising a concern, sharing ideas or requesting guidance without fear of retaliation; however, sometimes
speaking up is easier said than done. Please consider the consequences if you stay silent—to yourself, your coworkers and to
PG&E. The goal of a speak-up culture is to have an environment where we all feel welcome to express concerns, share new ideas
or request guidance.
What is misconduct?
Misconduct is behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, PG&E policies, standards or procedures, or laws or regulations.
Misconduct may be a willful or intentional act, an unintentional act, or a failure to act. Misconduct is serious and may result in
discipline or termination of employment.
Examples of misconduct include but are not limited to:
    Retaliation
    Improper use of drugs or alcohol
    Acts or threats of violence
    Fraud, bribery or corruption
    Unethical conduct
    Falsification of company records, including inspection forms, time sheets and expense reports
    Conflicts of interest
    Theft and inappropriate sharing of company data
    Harassment and discrimination
    Failure to comply with accounting procedures or practices, such as submitting or approving false or misleading information    
    Violations of the law
    Any conduct inconsistent with our Virtues
Read our Employee Conduct Standard. (CDT-1004S)
REQUESTING GUIDANCE AND REPORTING CONCERNS
It’s your responsibility to raise concerns about safety or misconduct, including violations of laws, regulations or internal
requirements. If you are uncertain about a situation, you have a duty to seek clarification and guidance on interpretations of the
Code, safety issues, ethics, compliance and legal issues. We all have a responsibility to identify and internally report potential
safety and operational issues (you can read about this in more detail in the Building Trust with Governments section of this Code in
Section 08).
HOW YOU CAN SPEAK UP
You have many ways to speak up to voice a concern. You can contact your immediate leader. If the issue involves your leader or
you are uncomfortable with that approach, consider elevating your concern to the next level of management. Know that you are not
required to go to a leader. Here are some additional options.
Emergency concerns
If there is a life-threatening or emergency situation, contact 911 and seek emergency care immediately.
If there is workplace violence concern, contact Corporate Security at 1-800-691-0410. If the concern is urgent, contact 911.
Coworker conduct and guidance
Contact the E&C Helpline 24/7 at 1-888-231-2310 or www.pgecorp.ethicspoint.com to report violations of our Code of
Conduct, accounting issues or illegal activity. You may remain anonymous if you wish. To request guidance or ask questions
about the Code of Conduct, policies, standards or procedures, contact the Ethics & Compliance Department at
EthicsComplianceHelp@pge.com. If you are not sure where to turn, the E&C Helpline will determine where to take the issue
and provide you with guidance on next steps.
Unsafe work practices and process concerns
Contact the Corrective Action Program (CAP) at 1-855-85-GO-CAP to report safety and equipment issues, non-compliance,
ineffective or inefficient work processes and procedures, and process improvement ideas. You may remain anonymous if you wish.
Safety incidents and injuries
If you experience a work-related illness or injury, including any injury that affects your ability to work pain-free, you should call the
24/7 Nurse Care Line at 1-888-449-7787 right away and notify your supervisor.
In life-threatening or emergency situations, call 911 and seek emergency care immediately.
In addition, Diablo Canyon Power Plant and Humboldt Bay Power Plant coworkers and contractors may contact the Employee
Concerns Program (ECP) Hotline at 805-545-4994
or ECPHotline@pge.com to request guidance or report nuclear safety and nuclear quality concerns.
GOOD FAITH REPORTING AND OUR POLICY AGAINST RETALIATION
At PG&E, we don’t tolerate retaliation against anyone who raises good faith concerns or has cooperated in an investigation.
Coworkers may not retaliate or threaten retaliation. Leaders may not tolerate retaliation that they observe against another coworker,
and have a duty to act to prevent and report retaliatory actions that come to their attention. Retaliation is harmful and can have a
chilling effect on other coworkers in raising concerns.
What is retaliation?
Retaliation is adversely changing a coworker’s condition of employment for a non-business reason. It occurs when a coworker or
leader takes or threatens to take an adverse, non-business-related action against a coworker who has raised a concern or
cooperated in an investigation. Examples include threatening a coworker for raising a concern or moving their physical location
without a legitimate business reason. A coworker who speaks up in good faith will not be put at any disadvantage by PG&E as a
result of their report.
INVESTIGATING REPORTS OF MISCONDUCT AND UNSAFE WORK PRACTICES
PG&E takes reports of misconduct and unsafe work practices seriously. Your role is to bring forward allegations and unsafe work
practices to leaders. You must cooperate with investigations by promptly responding to information requests. Be sure to provide
complete, truthful and accurate information. Leaders must take action on issues brought to their attention, including reaching out to
other resources such as:
    E&C Helpline for misconduct issues and guidance on policies
    CAP for unsafe work practices, non-compliance and process improvements
OUR MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS PROCESS:
1.    Report: A coworker, supplier or customer raises a potential misconduct allegation to their leader, Human Resources or the
E&C Helpline.
2.    Assign: Ethics & Compliance reviews the report and determines the appropriate next step, which in many cases will
include an investigation. The investigation may be conducted by PG&E resources, including Human Resources or
Corporate Security, or by outside investigators. If no investigation is needed, move to step 5.
3.    Investigate: The internal or external investigator begins an investigation, if warranted. This may include interviews and/or a
review of relevant documents, data or materials.
4.    Record: The investigator documents the case findings. When the investigation is complete, the appropriate PG&E leaders
are notified and the outcome is recorded in PG&E’s case management system.
5.    Resolve: Based on the findings, Human Resources and the business group work together to determine the appropriate
next steps, which may include training, policy modification, disciplinary action or termination of employment. Regardless of
the outcome of the investigation, the coworker, supplier or customer who raised the concern will be notified that the
investigation has been concluded.
6.    Track and analyze: Ethics & Compliance tracks, analyzes and provides guidance to lines of business and PG&E
leadership on trends and issues.

PG&E does not tolerate harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment. This policy includes any conduct, communication,
text message, image, data, sound, social media post or other information that is inappropriate, offensive or contains material of a
sex-based nature. Coworkers who witness or experience harassing behavior have a duty to speak up and report it. Coworkers who
engage in harassment will face disciplinary action, including potential termination of employment.

PG&E does not tolerate harassment of any kind. If you see something, speak up.
CONDUCT OUTSIDE OF WORK
Your conduct away from company property and outside of business hours could have a negative effect on your coworkers, the
public, workplace safety, on PG&E’s reputation and on our ability to serve customers. Conduct outside of work includes social
media posts brought to PG&E’s attention that violate our Code of Conduct.
PG&E will assess off-duty conduct that is potentially harmful to PG&E, our coworkers, or customers on a case-by-case basis and
determine appropriate action(s).
HEALTH AND SAFETY
VIOLENCE-FREE WORKPLACE
PG&E maintains a safe and secure workplace and working environment. Coworkers who engage in acts or threats of physical
violence, intimidation, harassment, stalking, sabotage or vandalism may be disciplined or terminated from employment.
Weapons
We do not permit weapons in our workplace or on our job sites. Weapons may not be brought, carried, stored or used on property
or in vehicles that are PG&E-owned, leased or rented, or in a personal vehicle while being used for PG&E business, unless there is
an authorized and legitimate business reason to do so.
What is permitted on PG&E property or job sites?
    Tools used for legitimate PG&E business purposes
    A personal defense product (including pepper spray or electric shock products that do not fire a projectile; firearms are NOT
permitted)
    Small pocketknives with a blade length of three inches or less
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I won’t bring a weapon onto company property or a job site, a company vehicle or a personal vehicle used for company
business unless authorized by Corporate Security.
SECURING OUR PEOPLE, PROPERTY AND ASSETS
PG&E is committed to creating a safe environment and taking care of our assets. All coworkers must perform their work in a
manner that safeguards the public, our customers, coworkers and PG&E. Doing so is critical for providing safe, reliable, affordable
and clean energy.
Securing our people
As a member of PG&E’s workforce, you are crucial in the fight against acts of sabotage, crime and terrorism. Your daily duties place
you in a position to observe and report such instances as
unknown people or packages and open doors or gates on our premises. If you see something, speak up. This is how we improve
our safety.
Protecting our technology
As an energy provider, we share the responsibility for keeping California’s energy networks running. Securing our technology is
integral to carrying out this responsibility. Helping to secure that technology is the personal responsibility of every PG&E coworker.
Coworkers must follow these technology practices:
    Only authorized computers and equipment may be connected to PG&E networks
    Only approved, authorized and properly licensed software and applications may be used on PG&E IT assets, including
computers, tablets and smartphones
    Never click on links or open email attachments unless the email is expected and you know and trust the sender
    Only use technology assets outside the U.S. if you’ve received pre-approval and follow security guidelines for international
travel
    Never transfer company data or personal information outside PG&E without following company guidelines. This includes:
o    Transferring PG&E information to a personal computer, phone, cloud storage, external hard drive or any other
device or location
o    Emailing PG&E information to a personal email account
o    Exception: Your personnel information, such as W2s, pay stubs and benefits, may be sent to your personal email
account
Limited personal use of certain PG&E assets is permitted if the use is minor and incidental to business. This includes personal
computers, phones, scanners, copy machines and conference rooms. For example, you can occasionally make a personal phone
call using your PG&E-owned device. However, personal use of company vehicles is not permitted. PG&E assets are monitored,
and coworkers should have no expectation of privacy when using them.
Coworkers who are issued PG&E-owned devices, such as smartphones, should conduct company business on their PG&E-owned
devices—not on their personal devices.
Communications, including emails and text messages, should always be respectful of our coworkers, customers, and other
stakeholders. PG&E will take action in response to communications that are in conflict with our Virtues.
Read our Software Management Standard (IT-1001S) and User Responsibilities Standard. (SEC-1001S)
Property and other PG&E assets
Proper treatment of PG&E assets, including digital assets, protects PG&E’s critical infrastructure, the safety of the electric grid,
generation assets and gas pipeline system, and our customers’ and coworkers’ data. Coworkers are responsible for the proper
acquisition, use, maintenance, protection and disposal of PG&E assets. Misuse or theft of PG&E assets,
including taking or using company materials for personal use, will result in disciplinary action or termination of employment.
Misuse or theft of PG&E assets, including taking or using company materials for personal use, will result in disciplinary action or
termination of employment.
What are PG&E assets?
Does PG&E own it, rent it, or lease it? If the answer is yes, it’s a PG&E asset.
Tangible assets include materials, computers, phones, tablets, tools, real property, vehicles, physical structures, meters and
equipment.
Intangible assets include data, information and records concerning PG&E coworkers, suppliers or customers, and intellectual
property and non-public information about PG&E.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
•    I will be diligent in protecting PG&E’s technology system.
•    I will physically secure mobile devices.
•    I will observe all information security controls and never try to circumvent them.
•    I will immediately report any suspected or actual breach of PG&E’s computer
•    systems and networks to the Technology Solution Center (TSC) at 415-973-9000.
•    I will speak up about security concerns, including unknown people or packages and open doors or gates.
•    I won’t let others tailgate into PG&E facilities and will follow proper badge protocol.
•    I won’t take, misuse or divert any PG&E assets for any reason.
•    I will respect limits on personal use of PG&E assets.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
I will be diligent in protecting PG&E’s technology system.
FITNESS FOR DUTY
Coworkers are expected to be mentally and physically fit for duty, and to remain fit while on duty. If your fitness for duty is called into
question, you may be subject to a mandatory fitness for duty assessment and/or U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) or non-
DOT Reasonable Suspicion testing.
Violation of fitness for duty policies or alcohol-free and drug-free workplace standards will result in disciplinary action or termination
of employment.
Alcohol-free and drug-free workplace
Working under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including recreational and medical marijuana, is prohibited. This includes working
remotely, on company property or at a jobsite. Coworkers may not transport alcohol or drugs in a company-owned, rented or leased
vehicle, or a personal vehicle while on company business.
Authorized use of alcohol
In rare circumstances, coworkers may seek and obtain prior consent from a director or officer to transport alcohol in a company-
owned, rented or leased vehicle. Alcohol is not permitted at company events unless an officer provides prior written approval for
consuming alcohol for special occasions or certain business meetings. This must be limited and must not violate regulations. Do not
operate a company vehicle after consuming alcohol.
If you attend a conference on behalf of PG&E and alcohol is served in the evening at a reception or meal, you may consume
alcohol in moderation. However, be mindful that your actions impact PG&E’s reputation, and you may not conduct official business
while under the influence of alcohol. Also, you may not drive a company-owned, rented or leased vehicle or a rental vehicle after
consuming alcohol at an event.
Read PG&E’s Employee Business Expenses and Travel Standard. (FIN-2210S)
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
•    I won’t report to work under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or marijuana.
•    I won’t consume, possess, display, transport or sell alcohol, recreational or medical marijuana or illegal drugs while on
duty, on PG&E property or a jobsite, in a PG&E vehicle, or in a personal vehicle while on company business.

•    I won’t report to work under the influence of prescription or over-the-counter medications that could impair my ability to
work safely and efficiently.
•    I will comply with PG&E’s alcohol and drug standards and all fitness-for-duty policies and regulations.
ACCURATE DATA, RECORDS AND REPORTING
Accurate data  
 
Capturing and managing data effectively is critical for PG&E’s operations. 
 
Data management is a business-driven, enterprise-wide, shared responsibility that covers the full lifecycle of data. It includes the
creation, storage, access, controls, governance, quality, meta-data, usage, analysis, security, retention and disposal of data. 
 
Read the Enterprise Data Management Policy. (GOV-09)  
 
What is data? 
 
Data refers to the raw facts or figures that form the building blocks of information. 
 
How is data different than information or a record? 
 
Data are raw, unorganized facts that need to be processed. Information is a collection of data that has been given value through
analysis, interpretations or compilations in a meaningful form.
Information may be deemed a record or a non-record. Information, regardless of format, that documents business actions,
transactions, decisions, and/or contractual, legal or regulatory obligations are defined as records. 
 
ACCURATE RECORDS  
 
Accurate records are an essential part of PG&E’s operations. To keep our system safe and reliable, we must always complete and
document our work. 
 
Each coworker creates records and information. We are all responsible for managing PG&E records and information to verify they
are complete, accurate, reliable, secure and available throughout their lifecycle. 
 
Records must be managed and stored in accordance with specific PG&E policies, standards and procedures, including the
Enterprise Records Retention Schedule. The schedule lets coworkers know how long records need to be retained.   
Some company records may contain personal information or personal health information. See the Personal Information section for
more details. These should only be accessed by coworkers with a business need to know and should be stored according to PG&E
requirements for storage of confidential or restricted information.
Read the Enterprise Records and Information Management Standard. (GOV-7101S)
 
For guidance on recording meetings, read the PG&E Recording of Meetings Standard. (GOV-7116S) 
 
What is a record? 
 
Any information, regardless of format, that is created, received and/or maintained that documents business actions, transactions or
decisions, including supporting documents. Records also include contractual, legal or regulatory requirements or obligations, and
PG&E policies, standards and procedures. 
Examples of company records
    Maintenance records and inspection documents
    As-built drawings
    Personnel documents
    Reports to government agencies or other public communications
    Workers’ compensation or other benefit-related information, such as dependent eligibility
    Financial reports
    Payroll records, including timecards
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
I will follow proper record management practices.
What is fraud?
Fraud is an intentional, deceitful act, committed to obtain some illegal or unfair gain or advantage. There are numerous types
of fraud. For example, fraud can occur when a person misrepresents or conceals facts, or makes intentionally misleading
allegations. Some additional examples of fraud may include falsifying documents, misusing company
credit cards, splitting invoices or expense reports to avoid approval thresholds, intentionally overcharging customers or
changing a family member’s account in our billing system.
Coworkers who engage in this type of misconduct—or who assist suppliers in this type of misconduct—are subject to discipline
or termination of employment, and may also face criminal prosecution.
Fraud also includes falsifying time reporting for purposes of a personal advantage. Coworkers are responsible for the accuracy
of their own work-time submissions, even if timecards are completed by others. Review your claimed work times to confirm
accuracy before you submit them into the timekeeping system.
For guidance on timecards, read our Time Reporting Standard. (HR-1250S)
Fraud prevention and internal accounting controls
PG&E is committed to maintaining accurate books, records and accurate financial and non-financial reporting. PG&E actively
monitors for many types of fraud and continues to put controls in place to detect fraudulent activity. Fraud will not be tolerated and
leaders may not direct their coworkers to commit fraud on their behalf.
Business expenses
Misrepresentation of business expenses is also fraud. Use PG&E funds for PG&E business expenses only, whether paying by
credit card, cash or another method. No personal use is allowed on PG&E credit cards.
Business expenses must be:
    Reasonable
    Prudent
    Actual
    Necessary
    Incurred while on PG&E business
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I will follow proper record management practices.
    I won’t use company funds to make unauthorized or personal purchases.
    I won’t incur unreasonable expenses on behalf of PG&E.
Read our Employee Business Expenses and Travel Standard. (FIN-2210S)
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
You must not use PG&E property, corporate assets, corporate opportunities, company information or the influence of your position
in a manner that places your personal interests and/or the interests of a competitor before the interests of PG&E.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I will disclose any potential conflict of interest to my leader.
    If I find myself facing a situation that might be perceived as a conflict of interest, I won’t proceed without a written agreement
from my leader or appropriate decision maker.
What is a conflict of interest?
A conflict of interest occurs when a coworker’s private interests interfere, or even appear to interfere, with the interests of PG&E.
Influencing business decisions for personal gain
A potential or actual conflict of interest exists if you influence or try to influence a decision or transaction that could materially affect
the value of a financial interest that you hold or that is held by a member of your family or another person with whom you have a
close relationship.
Review our Conflicts of Interest Standard. (CDT-1005S)
Favored treatment
We don’t tolerate favored treatment, which is using your position to obtain preferential or advantageous treatment for yourself or
your close personal relationships. This includes hiring or promoting coworkers, selecting contractors or suppliers, or participating in
investment or other opportunities to which you’re made privy as a coworker of PG&E.
Refer to the Nepotism Policy. (HR-01)
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I will treat all fellow coworkers fairly.
    If I’m in a leadership position, I’ll make personnel decisions based on merit and performance.
    I will disclose close personal relationships to my leader to combat the appearance of favoritism or a conflict of interest.
As a PG&E coworker—
I will treat all fellow coworkers fairly.
Gifts
We protect our ability to make business decisions free of undue influence. If you give or receive a gift in a business setting, it can
create a sense or appearance of obligation that taints neutral decision-making. That’s why PG&E has very specific standards about
what you may receive from suppliers, business contacts and customers.
We may not offer or accept gifts of any value, other than items of no intrinsic value. Items of no intrinsic value include promotional
items, such as a pen or baseball cap with a logo, valued at $15 or less. PG&E coworkers, immediate family members, contractors,
consultants, those seeking to do business with PG&E and our suppliers, are all subject to the same rules regarding gifts.
    Check our standard. Before you accept or reject, go or don’t go – know what’s permitted in the Conflicts of Interest
Standard (CDT-1005S).
    If you’re not sure, ask. If the right course of action is not clear after consulting the standard, seek guidance from your
supervisor or the E&C Helpline at EthicsComplianceHelp@pge.com.
Return gifts that violate this policy to the giver with an explanation of our no-gift policy, and notify the E&C Helpline at
EthicsComplianceHelp@pge.com. If you return a gift to the giver within 30 days, or reimburse the giver from personal funds, it is
not considered a gift.
The rules surrounding providing items of value to federal, state and local government officers, officials and coworkers may be more
restrictive than PG&E’s gift policy.
Refer to our Conflicts of Interest Standard (CDT-1005S) for more guidance.
What is a gift?
A gift can be anything of value, including:
    A ticket to a sporting event, concert, play or other entertainment event
    A round of golf
    A non-business meal
    A bottle of wine
    A free service (car detail, free parking, etc.)
    A special discount not available to all coworkers
    An all-expenses-paid trip to a conference or trade show
    A ticket to a charitable or fundraising event given to a PG&E coworker by a third-party
    Perishable food items, such as a fruit basket or box of chocolates
    Cash
    Tips or gratuities
    Gift cards
What is a supplier?
An individual or organization that does or is actively seeking to do business with PG&E.
A supplier sent me a supplier-branded baseball cap. What should I do with it?
Keep it. It is OK to accept an item of no intrinsic value, such as a promotional pen or baseball cap with a logo valued at $15 or less.
A supplier sent me a bottle of wine as a holiday gift. What should I do with it?
Return the bottle of wine to the supplier with an explanation of our no gift standard.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I won’t accept or give gifts.
    I will ask my leader or Ethics & Compliance if I have questions about gifts.
    I will check with my leader if I plan to pursue outside employment opportunities.
Customary business meals and conference attendance
Customary business meals are not considered gifts. These are routine meals that are similar in cost to PG&E coworkers’ meals
when they travel for business.
If a coworker is a guest speaker at a conference hosted by a supplier or other third party, the conference host may pay the
coworker’s conference registration fee, in addition to customary business meals. PG&E is responsible for paying the coworker’s
airfare, lodging, entertainment and other expenses associated with attending the conference.
Outside employment
You’re not permitted to engage in outside employment or activities such as joining the board of directors of companies that
compete with products or services offered by PG&E. Additionally, coworkers are not permitted to take outside employment that has
or could have a negative effect on their ability to do their job at PG&E, or which otherwise could create a conflict of interest. If you
are, or plan to be, engaged in outside employment or activities, notify your leader and contact Ethics & Compliance for more
guidance.
Loans, wage advances or guarantees of obligations
PG&E prohibits loans, wage advances or guarantees of corporate funds to its coworkers or their friends and family members.
Coworkers or members of their families must never accept a loan, guarantee, service or payment from a contractor, supplier,
consultant or others doing business with PG&E under terms that are not available to the public.
Insider trading
Insider trading is illegal. Never disclose or “tip” inside information to others, or buy and sell securities based on material
information you receive as a coworker of PG&E.
Refer to PG&E’s Insider Trading Policy for more information. (CDT-1002S)
What is material information?
Information is “material” if a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision. Examples include
financial results, earnings projections, significant developments in major rate cases or other proceedings, matters before the
California Public Utilities Commission, significant cybersecurity issues, major litigation, changes in dividend policy or senior
management, major events regarding PG&E’s securities, mergers and acquisitions, or disposition of significant assets.
What is insider trading?
Insider trading is buying and/or selling stock or other securities—including PG&E Corporation Retirement Savings Plan (the
401(k) plan) transactions—while in possession of material non-public information.
(Section 06)
As our suppliers are an extension of PG&E, we expect them to deliver on our safety stand that everyone and everything is always
safe.
Section 06
Building Trust with Our Business Contacts
We do business honestly, fairly and lawfully.
DOING BUSINESS FAIRLY
We do business honestly, fairly and lawfully. We respect our competitors and do not make inaccurate or derogatory statements
about their products or services.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Intellectual property and other confidential information should remain within PG&E and not be shared with outsiders. Examples of
protected information are competitive strategy, costs and financing methods, trade secrets, pricing policy, contract terms, market
surveys, and capacity plans and capabilities. If you are authorized by a director or officer to share confidential information outside
PG&E, you must obtain a signed non-disclosure agreement from the third party to whom you disclose the information.
Works created by a coworker within the scope of their employment are considered the sole intellectual property of PG&E—not the
property of any coworker. Tell your leader about inventions and developments that you create within the scope of your employment
and with the use of PG&E resources.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I won’t view confidential information for a non-business reason.
    I won’t use confidential information for personal gain.
    I won’t share confidential information without the appropriate approval.
Copyright laws make it illegal to copy or reproduce materials without permission of the owner. Examples of copyright-protected
materials are books, newspapers, movies, computer software, drawings and musical recordings.
Patents are exclusive rights granted by a government to an inventor to manufacture, use or sell an invention for a certain number
of years.
Trademarks are words, symbols, slogans and phrases that distinguish goods and services from others and are used to build brand
identity.
Trade secrets include any information used by a business, such as formulas, devices or customer lists that have economic value
but are not generally known and for which reasonable efforts have been made to preserve secrecy.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I will keep PG&E’s intellectual property and trade secrets confidential and will not disclose them to any outside party without
prior approval from my director or officer.
    I won’t make unauthorized copies of software licensed to or created by PG&E.
    I won’t load unlicensed software onto PG&E computer equipment or download unauthorized software from the internet.
    I will tell my leader about inventions and developments that I create within the scope of my employment and with the use of
PG&E resources.
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
PG&E does not tolerate any form of bribery, corruption, extortion or embezzlement and we expect our suppliers, coworkers and
contractors to adhere to this same standard. We neither offer nor accept bribes, kickbacks, facilitation payments or any other similar
inducements.
Bribery and corruption have a negative effect on PG&E’s reputation. Coworkers who engage in this type of misconduct are subject
to discipline, including termination of employment, and may also face criminal prosecution.   
  
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits giving or offering anything of value to a foreign official, inside or outside the
United States, to influence or induce the recipient to misuse their official position to obtain or retain business or secure an improper
advantage. When you are traveling and working with foreign officials, be careful not to violate the FCPA. Contact the E&C Helpline
at EthicsComplianceHelp@pge.com with any questions, particularly concerning gifts and meals.
Read the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Standard. (CDT-1006S)
Antitrust and other laws, sanctions and controls
PG&E complies fully with all the following:
Antitrust laws were established to promote economic competition among businesses. Activities that limit competition, restrict trade
or otherwise dominate a market may violate antitrust laws. Such violations can expose PG&E and individual coworkers to criminal
penalties, fines and civil lawsuits.
Anti-boycott laws make it illegal to participate in any boycott between foreign countries if not otherwise sanctioned by U.S. law.
Treasury embargo sanctions prohibit U.S. companies and their foreign subsidiaries from doing business with certain countries,
agencies and individuals.
Export and import controls restrict or prohibit the export and import of sensitive goods, technology or software to certain
countries or individuals.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I won’t accept or make any offers from/to a supplier that could be viewed as a bribe or unethical payment in expectation of
favored treatment.
    I will promptly report any such instance of attempted bribery, corruption or extortion to my leader or the E&C Helpline.
What is a kickback?
A kickback is a “thank you” for favorable treatment under a contract. Examples of kickbacks can include:
    A customer gives a coworker a gift card to expedite their service connection
    A supplier thanks a coworker for a bid selection by offering them a trip
What is a facilitation payment?
A payment made to a government official to facilitate approval of a business transaction or activity.
What is a bribe?
Money or a favor given or promised to influence the judgement or conduct of another person.
WHO WE WORK WITH AND WHY
Suppliers are vital to PG&E’s success. Because suppliers are a visible extension of PG&E in our communities, we choose them
carefully based on fair and objective criteria. We expect
all our contractors and suppliers to behave ethically and comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies, and our Supplier
Code of Conduct.
SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT
As our suppliers are an extension of PG&E, we expect them to adhere to our Purpose, Virtues and our Stands and put safety
first. The PG&E Supplier Code of Conduct is the standard of conduct that all suppliers, as well as their employees, subcontractors
and sub-suppliers, must follow as they provide goods and services to PG&E. Failure to comply with the expectations covered in the
Supplier Code of Conduct could result in termination of an assignment and/or contract, and may also result in criminal prosecution.
If you are aware of any supplier misconduct or unsafe practices, please speak up by contacting the E&C Helpline at 1-888-
231-2310.
Read our Supplier Code of Conduct.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I will report suspected supplier misconduct.
    If I am in a leader or managerial role, I will ensure that any suppliers I work with understand and comply with the Supplier
Code of Conduct.
What does the Supplier Code of Conduct cover?
Topics include:
    Health and safety
    Environmental leadership
    Supplier diversity
    Labor issues and human rights
    Ethical business conduct
    Conflicts of interest
    Engagement with external third parties
    General administrative topics
As a PG&E coworker—

Building Trust with Our Communities and Customers
At the center of our Purpose, Virtues and Stands is our commitment to a sustainable energy future.
[Section introduction below appears on next page]
PG&E’s responsibilities as an energy provider go far beyond our core mission of providing safe, reliable, affordable and clean
energy to our 16 million customers. We also have a responsibility to build a better future for everyone whose lives we touch.

environment and carbon-neutral energy system shall be the reality for all Californians.

policy and a critical priority for our customers.  
 
PG&E serves our communities by protecting and preserving our environment, protecting sensitive information and communicating
honestly and openly about our business. We strive to represent ourselves consistently and with integrity. We work in partnership
with our communities to improve the quality of life everywhere we serve.
As a PG&E coworker—

PRESERVING OUR ENVIRONMENT
PG&E is committed to environmental leadership and to conducting business in an environmentally sensitive manner. The
cornerstone of our environmental policy is strict compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
We also seek opportunities to exceed current standards of environmental protection, including in the areas of pollution prevention,
climate protection, and habitat and species protection. Our annual Corporate Sustainability Report is one way we measure and
communicate our progress; we hold ourselves accountable and report on our performance with transparency.
Read our Environmental Policy. (ENV-01)

How to respond to inquiries from the media, including during emergencies
If you are contacted by the news media, immediately refer the contact to PG&E Marketing
and Communications at 415-973-5930. Do not attempt to improvise an answer, speculate, or downplay the seriousness of the
situation. A Marketing and Communications representative is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to respond to the news
media. Marketing and Communications also handles requests for PG&E subject matter experts.
Social media
PG&E respects your right to participate in social media and understands that your time outside of work is your own. Social media
used appropriately and effectively can help PG&E build and strengthen relationships with our customers, coworkers and community
members.
Social media activity brought to PG&E’s attention that violates PG&E’s Code of Conduct will be reviewed for potential disciplinary
action or termination of employment. PG&E will assess such social media activity on a case-by-case basis and determine
appropriate action(s). The assessment will include whether the activity includes threats or allusions to violence and/or offensive
content (e.g., hate speech) and whether it could reasonably lead to reluctance on the part of other coworkers or customers to work
with the coworker.
PG&E applies the requirements in this Code of Conduct in a manner that does not interfere with or limit coworkers’ rights under the
National Labor Relations Act. Legally protected social media discussions include discussions about wages, hours and working
conditions; the right to self-organize, form, join or assist labor organizations; the right to bargain collectively through representatives
of your choosing regarding your wages, hours and working conditions; the right to engage in other concerted activities about the
same topics or other mutual aid or protection; or to refrain from engaging in such activities.

Read the Charitable Contributions Standard. (CR-5002S)
(Section 08)
PG&E is committed to complying with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.
Section 08
Building Trust with Governments
Coworkers must comply with all requirements related to government business.
PG&E is committed to complying with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. We expect coworkers to meet all legal
and regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental bodies that regulate our business.
We are also fully committed to abiding by all laws governing interactions between PG&E and various governmental bodies. We
respond appropriately to all government inquiries and investigations.
ENHANCED OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT PROCESS 
 
The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process is a framework designed to make sure that PG&E meets our safety and
operational commitments to better serve our customers and communities. Reporting systemic safety issues for gas, electric or
generation to the CPUC is a key component of the process. The focus is preventive—tracking our progress and performance to
identify issues early, before they become a problem, and to correct any issues promptly if they arise.  
 
Read the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process Policy (GOV-11) and the GOV-CPUC Enhanced Oversight and
Enforcement Process Standard. (GOV-1041S)
 
What is the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process?  
The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process was established by the CPUC and outlines a six-step process of escalating
CPUC oversight and enforcement measures based on specific Triggering Events (PG&E refers to these as Compliance Events).
What is my role in the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process?  
 
It is critical that we work with integrity, meet our compliance commitments and protect public, coworker and contractor safety. That
means doing your day-to-day job well and following all regulatory and internal requirements.  
 
The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process underscores our virtues of being trustworthy and owners. If you see
something that doesn’t feel right, speak up. Help to identify potential safety and operational issues early so that we can address
them. We need everyone’s engagement to stay safe and compliant. This will help us improve our safety and operational outcomes
and enable us to better serve our customers. Report safety issues to the Corrective Action Program (CAP), any Event Owner or
Business Lead, or contact enhancedoversightquestions@pge.com. Read more about reporting safety issues in the Speak Up,
Listen Up, Follow Up section of this Code. 
PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS
PG&E encourages coworkers to be informed voters and become involved in the political process. As a coworker you must make it
clear that any contributions you make, views you may express or activities you undertake are your own and not those of PG&E. If
you choose to contribute or participate, your contributions must be on a personal basis, using your own time and funds.
Participation in company-approved political action committees is voluntary.
PG&E will not reimburse you for any contribution of money donated or time spent by you on that activity.
Serving in federal, state or local government
If you seek election or appointment to a public office while employed by PG&E, contact PoliticalCompliance@pge.com to seek
guidance regarding potential conflicts of interest and how those issues should be addressed.
INTERACTING WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS
The California Public Utilities Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other state and federal agencies have
rules that restrict and require disclosure of certain communications with decision makers about issues in proceedings before those
agencies. All communications with regulatory personnel must also be truthful and accurate. Ex parte communications (see
definition below), in particular, are strictly regulated.
When engaging in communications with regulatory agencies, PG&E coworkers and agents are expected to seek guidance from the
Law Department or Regulatory Affairs and follow PG&E policies and standards.
Read our Ex Parte CPUC Communications Procedure. (CR-2001P-06)
What denotes a public official?
A public official is any government employee or representative, including elected or appointed officials in foreign, federal, state and
local governments, regulatory commissions and other oversight agencies.
What is an ex parte communication?
An ex parte communication is a communication between a decision maker and an interested person concerning an issue in a
formal proceeding that does not occur on the record. Ex parte communications can occur when information is not shared in a public
forum or is kept out of the record of the proceeding.
DOING BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT
We are proud to provide services to the United States federal government and state and local government entities. As a federal
contractor, we must comply with a number of laws, regulations
and contractual requirements that are unique. Many of these requirements are different from and more restrictive than requirements
in the commercial marketplace.
An example of these restrictive requirements is when certain government officials visit, we may not be able to provide them with
common business courtesies, like a bottle of water or a meal.
Coworkers must comply with all requirements related to government business:
    We always act with integrity and communicate honestly.
    Fraudulent or dishonest acts in fulfilling a government contract can trigger severe penalties under the False Claims Act,
including fines and jail sentences.
    This includes making false statements or representations, submitting false claims or charging for hours not worked.
As a federal contractor, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has certain obligations that we must meet. Our existing policies meet
U.S. government standards, including a zero-tolerance policy on human trafficking, procuring commercial sex acts and using forced
labor.
Any coworker who violates these policies may be subject to disciplinary action or termination of employment. These policies apply
to consultants, contractors and subcontractors working with or for Pacific Gas and Electric Company. As these are also government
policies, the government may remove us from a contract if we violate these provisions. Government contracts may also have other
special provisions and reporting requirements.
Be aware of those special provisions and immediately contact the Ethics & Compliance Department if any questions arise.
For more information, refer to our Federal Contract Compliance Program Charter (GOV-1028S) and Federal Government
Contracts Compliance Standard. (RISK-4201S)
Political contributions and gifting
The rules surrounding providing items of value to federal, state and local government officers, officials and employees may be more
restrictive than PG&E’s gift policy. Contact the State and Regulatory Affairs Compliance, Risk and Operations team to receive
advance approval for all contributions (monetary and in-kind) or gifts (including food and beverages) made to government officers,
officials or employees on behalf of PG&E.
For more information, refer to our Conflicts of Interest Standard. (CDT-1001S)
Lobbying
Direct lobbying or similar political activity on behalf of PG&E may be done only by coworkers who are properly registered and who
are specifically approved by State and Regulatory Affairs and/or Federal Affairs. Contact PoliticalCompliance@pge.com with any
questions.
For more information, refer to our Federal, State, and Local Lobbying Standard. (CR-1003S)
Disclosures and public communications
PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company must comply with federal laws and regulations that require the disclosure
of certain information related to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. If you are asked to review a draft SEC report,
respond promptly to help ensure that the SEC reports, other public disclosures, and the information contained within, are full, fair,
timely, accurate, understandable and complete.
AS A PG&E COWORKER—
    I will understand the laws and regulations applicable to my job, including specific rules related to government contracting or
interacting with governmental bodies.
As a federal contractor, we must comply with a number of laws, regulations, and contractual requirements that are unique.
