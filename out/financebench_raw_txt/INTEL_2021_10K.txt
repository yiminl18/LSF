A Year in Review
Total revenue of $79.0 billion  was up year over year, with CCG revenue 
up 1% and DCG revenue down  1%, both amid the effects of industry-
wide supply constraints. We experienced strength in notebook demand 
and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook 
ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. 
DCG was down on lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive 
environment, partially offset by higher platform1 volume from recovery 
in the enterprise and government market segment. IOTG and Mobileye 
both achieved strong results on higher demand amid recovery from the 
economic impacts of COVID-19. We invested $15.2 billion  in R&D, 
made capital investments of $18.7 billion , and generated $30.0 billion  in 
cash from operations and $11.3 billion  of free cash flow.
"We achieved solid results amid a highly constrained industry-
wide supply environment while continuing to maintain a strong 
balance sheet and liquidity position. With our IDM 2.0 strategy, we 
enter a phase of significant investment, positioning us for product 
leadership and long-term growth."

Investing  in our IDM 2.0 strategy for the long term
To support our IDM 2.0 strategy , we are making significant capital investments  to increase our  manufacturing capacity  and accelerate our 
process technology roadma p, as well as increasing our investments in R&D. We believe these investments will position us for 
accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect o ur long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth 
rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect 
gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-
GAAP  gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%2 over the next several years  before moving upward. We also expect our capital 
expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our 
capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term.

New CEO and leadership team  changes
Our new CEO Pat Gelsinger joined Intel on February 15, 2021 and made several senior leadership changes throughout the year. We also 
named our new CFO David Zinsner in January 2022. Mr. Gelsinger returns to Intel, where he previously spent 30 years of his career, 
learned at the feet of Intel’s founders, and served as our first Chief Technology Officer.
IDM 2.0
On March 23, 2021, we announced our "IDM 2.0" strategy , the next evolution of our IDM model . Our IDM 2.0 strategy combines our 
internal factory network, strategic use of external foundries, and our new IFS business to position us to drive technology and product 
leadership. To accelerate this strategy, we announced plans to invest $20 billion to build two new fabs in Arizona, which we broke ground 
on in September, and we recently announced plans to invest more than $20 billion in the construction of two new leading-edge fabs in 
Ohio. We also announced approximately $10.5 billion total investment to equip our Rio Rancho, New Mexico and Malaysia sites for 
advanced packaging manufacturing. In August, the US Department of Defense announced that IFS will lead the first phase of its multi-
phase RAMP-C program to facilitate the use of a domestic commercial foundry infrastructure.
Process and packaging technology roadmaps
At the Intel Accelerated event in July 2021, we provided an update on our manufacturing process and packaging technology roadmaps. 
We introduced future nodes, including Intel 3 and Intel 20A, and discussed future process and packaging technologies, such as our 
PowerVia, RibbonFET, Foveros Omni, and Foveros Direct technologies. As part of the update, we also introduced a new naming structure 
for our manufacturing process nodes, which includes the name changes summarized in " Key Terms " within Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements .
12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors
We announced the 12th Gen Intel Core processor family (Alder Lake), the first on 
the Intel 7 process, with real-world performance for enthusiast gamers and 
professional creators. Alder Lake is the first processor based on our performance 
hybrid architecture featuring a combination of Performance-cores, the highest 
performing CPU cores Intel has built, and Efficient-cores designed for scalable 
multi-threaded workload performance.
Ice Lake Server processors
We launched the 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable CPU (Ice Lake), which boasts 
up to 40 cores and delivers a significant increase in performance, on average, 
compared to the previous generation. The chips include a set of built-in security 
features, cryptographic acceleration, and AI.

including an SoC for wireless base stations, structured ASICs for 5G network 
acceleration, and a 5G network-optimized Ethernet NIC.
Intel® Arc™ graphics
We revealed the brand for our upcoming consumer high-performance graphics 
products: Intel Arc. The Arc brand will cover hardware, software, and services, 
and will span multiple hardware generations, with the first generation discrete 
GPU (Alchemist) based on the Xe HPG microarchitecture and shipping to OEMs 
in Q1 2022.
First closing of divestiture of NAND memory business
On December 29, 2021 , subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end, we completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory 
business to SK hynix, Inc. (SK hynix). We intend to invest transaction proceeds to deliver leadership products and advance our long-term 
growth priorities.Table  of Contents
Fundamentals of Our Business 5
Our Strategy
The world is becoming more digital, and computing more pervasive. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering the 
digitization of everything , which is being accelerated by four superpowers: ubiquitous comput e, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, pervasive 
connectivity, and AI. Together these superpowers reinforce and amplify one another, and will exponentially increase the world’s need for 
computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing these 
superpowers for our customers’ growth and our own.
We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our software , silicon and platforms, and packaging  and process technology with 
at-scale manufacturing . With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers, our strategy to win is focused o n three key themes : 
product leadership, open platforms, and m anufacturing at scale. 
Our Priorities
Product Leadership
Lead and democratize compute  with Intel x86 and  xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from edge computing 
to 5G networks, the cloud, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.
At our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines 
of code written and optimized for x86 CPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on 
performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application performance, and microarchitectures focused on 
efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance. Our innovative new 12th 
Gen client processors (Alder Lake)  combine both performance cores and efficient cores in a performance hybrid architecture that can 
direct workloads to the right core depending on whether they require higher performance or power efficiency. We can also combine  these  
architectural advances with our innovations in process and packaging technology, as in our next-generation Intel Xeon data center CPU  
(Sapphire Rapids) , which will utilize performance cores on multiple compute tiles connected through our EMIB  packaging technology in a 
scalable design, rather than being built on a monolithic silicon die. 
Beyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and 
other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad 
portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading 
products across each of these architectural categories. Our vision is that our products will help enable a future in which every human can 
have one petaflop of computing power and one petabyte of data less than one millisecond away.Table  of Contents
Fundamentals of Our Business 6
Open Platforms
We aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards . Around the globe, companies are building their 
networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic 
contributions in developing standards such as CXL, ThunderboltTM, and PCle. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of 
new open-source products in the industry such as Linux, Android, and others. The world's developers constantly innovate and expand the 
capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability , and security.  In addition, microservices have enabled the 
development of flexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via APIs to create end-to-end processes. We use industry 
collaboration, co-engineering, and open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Through our oneAPI initiative, developers 
use a unified language across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to cut down on development time and to enhance productivity. We also deliver a 
steady stream of open-source code and optimizations for projects across virtually every platform and usage model. We are committed to 
co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology 
advancements and help new software and hardware work better together . Our commitment extends to developers through our developer -
first approach based on openness, choice, and trust. 
Manufacturing at Scale 
In March 2021 , we introduced IDM 2.0, the next evolution and expansion of our IDM model. IDM 2.0 is a differentiated strategy that 
combines three capabilities:
Internal factory network.  Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, 
improved economics, and supply resilience. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of 
semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.
Strategic use of foundry capacity.  We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with 
increased flexibility and scale to optimize our product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity 
will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. 
Foundry services . We intend to build a world-class foundry business to meet the growing global demand for semiconductors. We plan to 
differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, 
committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as 
well as other ecosystem IP . 
We believe our IDM 2.0 strategy will enable us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing demand, while 
providing superior capacity and supply resilience and an advantageous cost structure.
Delivering on our IDM 2.0 strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. 
Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive 
workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every 
person on the planet.
Growth Imperative
We are investing to position the company for accelerated long-term growth, focusing on both our core businesses and our growth 
businesses. In our client and server businesses, our strategy is to invest to strengthen the competitiveness of our product roadmap and to 
explore opportunities in both client  and data center adjacencies. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow and gain share in 
graphics; mobility, including autonomous driving ; networking and edge; and foundry services. 
Focus on Innovation and Execution
We are focused on executing our product and process roadmap and accelerating our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed 
process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering leadership 
products in every area in which we compete. We are seeking to return our culture to its roots in innovation and execution, drawing on 
principles established by our former CEO Andy Grove that emphasize discipline and accountability.Table  of Contents

We take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities, and subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end, we 
completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory business. Additionally, in 2020 we completed the divestiture of the 
majority of Home Gateway Platform, a division of CCG, and in 2019 we divested the majority of our smartphone modem business.
Return  Cash to Stockholders
Our third allocation priority is to return cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We 
expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years.

Intellectual Capital
Research and Development
R&D investment is critical  to enable us to deliver on our accelerated process technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and 
develop new businesses and capabilities in the f uture . We seek to protect our R&D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&D 
initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.
Areas Key to Product Leadership
Every year we make significant investments in R&D and we have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective 
with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances  in performance, power, cost, 
connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus o n reducing our design complexity,  re-using IP, and increasing 
ecosystem collaboration  to improve our efficiency .
Process and packaging.  At our Intel Accelerated event in July 2021, we provided an update on our manufacturing process and 
packaging technology roadmaps. As part of the update, we also introduced a new naming structure for our manufacturing process 
nodes, which includes the name changes summarized in "Key Terms". In addition, we introduced future nodes and discussed future 
process and packaging technologies on our roadmap. Our updates included the following: 
▪We introduced further optimizations to our Intel 7 process node, which is now in production for our 12th Gen Intel Core (Alder 
Lake) processors.
▪Intel 4 will make use of EUV to print incredibly small features using ultra-short wavelength light. Intel 4 will be used for our future 
Meteor Lake client processors.
▪Intel 3 will leverage further FinFET optimizations and increased EUV to deliver additional performance-per-watt and area 
improvements over Intel 4.
▪Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies: Ribbon FET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, Intel’s 
implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, will be our first new transistor architecture since we pioneered FinFET in 2011. 
The technology is expected to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins 
in a smaller footprint. PowerVia will be our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery, optimizing signal 
transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.
▪Beyond Intel 20A, we are developing our Intel 18A node, with expected refinements to RibbonFET to deliver additional 
transistor performance improvements. We are also working to define, build, and deploy next-generation High Numerical 
Aperture EUV in our process technology roadmap.
▪Our future Foveros Omni advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of our 3D stacking Foveros 
technology, enabling us to mix multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles across mixed fab nodes and giving us greater 
flexibility for disaggregated chip designs. With our future Foveros Direct technology, we will move to direct copper-to-copper 
bonding for low-resistance interconnects and blur the boundary between where the wafer ends and the package begins.
xPU architecture. The future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, accelerator, and 
FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building 
processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing: 
▪CPU. We started shipping our 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable  processors (Ice Lake) with the new Sunny Cove core, built-in AI 
acceleration, crypto graphic  acceleration, and advanced security capabilities. We also launched our 12th Gen Intel Core 
processors (Alder Lake), which will scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook platforms . They utilize 
the new breakthrough Performance-core  (Golden Cove) and Efficient-core (Gracemont)  microarchitectures and work with Intel® 
Thread Director  for scheduling optimization.
▪GPU . We announced Alchemist, our first Intel Arc branded high-performance discrete GPU family of products focused on gaming 
and content creation, which began shipping to OEMs in Q1 2022. We also powered on  Ponte Vecchio , our discrete GPU focused 
on high-performance computing applications, which delivers leading floating-point operations per second (FLOPS)  and compute 
density  to accelerate AI, high-performance computing, and advanced analytics workloads. Ponte Vecchio will be released in 
2022 for HPC and AI markets.
▪Interconnect.  Mount Evans, Intel’s first ASIC IPU, is designed to address the complexity of diverse and dispersed data centers. 
An IPU is designed to enable cloud and communication service providers to reduce overhead and free up performance for 
CPUs.
▪Matrix Accelerator. Habana Gaudi accelerators are at the forefront of AI solutions for data centers. Amazon Web Services 
launched the EC2 DL1 instance featuring Habana Gaudi in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud for training deep learning models.Table  of Contents
 
 Fundamentals of Our Business Our Capital 10
Software.  Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures . 
▪In 2021, oneAPI adoption expanded across the industry. oneAPI enables developers to build cross-architecture applications 
using a single code base across xPUs that take advantage of unique hardware features and lower  software development and 
maintenance costs. Developers can choose the best architecture for the problem at hand without rewriting their entire code base, 
accelerating their time to value.
▪We seek to accelerate adoption of oneAPI and Intel software developer  tools through diverse ecosystem activities including 
developer trainings, summits, centers of excellence, and access to Intel hardware and software through a developer cloud. The 
Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI  hosts  globa l users spanning AI, data science, high-performance computing, and media & graphics 
and other  accelerated computing workloads .
▪We believe AI will be ubiquitou s, and with our tools and the broad open software ecosystem, we are well-positioned to scale AI.  
We optimize for the most widely used AI frameworks and libraries, including TensorFlow, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, XGBoost, 
and Spark, with certain optimizations delivering up to 1 0 to 100 times performance improvements  to support end-to-end AI, as 
well as  OpenVINOTM and oneAPI AI Analytics toolkits .
▪We seek to continually improve our BIOS and firmware in support of our client, data center, networking, and graphics products, 
including delivering simplified and cloud-optimized open firmware for data center customers  through our Firmware  Support 
Package and Minimum Platform Architecture. 
IP Rights
We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities 
and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to 
protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. 
We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products 
are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases may be obsolete before the patents are granted. As we 
expand our product offerings into new areas, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to 
developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. 
The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To 
distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain 
cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. 
We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we 
believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized 
international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we 
will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable 
terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see " Risk Factors " within Other Key Information . While our IP rights are important to 
our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.
"Here at Intel, we take pride in attracting some of the world’s best engineers, technologists, and 
innovators. We are advocates for a patent system that eliminates abuse by hedge funds and 
others who exploit weaknesses in the system to drive their profits at the expense of those of us 
who actually invent, create, and produce products that are central to the modern economy."
—Steve Rodgers,  Executive Vice President and General Counsel
Manufacturing Capital
Inspired by Moore's Law, a law of economics put forth  by our co-founder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago, we continuously work to 
advance the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address our customers' greatest challenges. This makes possible the 
innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size. We continue to work across our 
supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and increase overall capacity and output to meet customer expectations. In 
2021 , our factories performed well in a highly dynamic environment, where we adapted to rapid demand shifts and industry component 
shortages affecting  us and ou r customers.
Our IDM 2.0 strategy allows us to deliver leadership products through the use of internal and external capacity while leveraging our core 
strengths for growth via providing foundry services to others. IDM 2.0 combines three factors. First, we will continue to build the majority of 
our products in Intel fabs. Second, we expect our use of third party foundry capacity to grow and to include manufacturing for a range of 
modular tiles on advanced process technologies. Third, we intend to build  a world-class foundry  business with IFS, which will combine 
leading-edge process and packaging technology, committed capacity in the U S and Europe , and a world-class IP portfolio for customers, 
including x86 cores.  During the year we began shipping packaging units for our first IFS customer, Amazon Web Services .Table  of Contents

“In alignment with our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are repositioning Intel for growth by increasing our 
investment in internal manufacturing, expanding our global capacity for supply chain resiliency, 
and delivering on world class manufacturing execution.”
—Keyvan Esfarjani, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and 
Operations
"Process and packaging are at the very heart of Intel’s heritage and are the foundation of 
everything we build. With the roadmaps we unveiled this year, we plan to accelerate our rate of 
innovation to reach process performance-per-watt parity by 2024 and leadership by 2025, and to 
maintain advanced packaging leadership." 
—Dr. Ann Kelleher, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Technology Development
Network and Supply Chain
Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and 
operations, sales and marketing, and business units, and our supply ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our mission is 
to enable product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost of ownership, and uninterrupted supply for our cus tomers. In addition 
to our own manufacturing capacity, we continue to expand our use of third-party foundries . 
The majority of our logic wafer manufacturing is conducted in the U S. As of our fiscal 2021 year-end, we had ten manufacturing sites — 
six are wafer fabrication and four  are assembly/test facilities . The following map shows these factory sites and the countries where we 
have a significant R&D and/or sales  presenc e. In response to COVID-19,  we maintained operational changes and measures  to enable a 
continued safe environment for our employees and operation of our manufacturing sites .
Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, and testing of our platform products. We 
operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, allowing us to better 
analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new process technologies are transferred identically from a 
central development fab to each manufacturing facility. After transfer, the network of factories and the development fab collaborate to 
continue  driving operational improvements. This enables fast ramp of the operation, fast learning, and quality control . We are expanding 
manufacturing capacity across multiple sites , including Arizona, Ireland, Israel, and Oregon . To accelerate our IDM 2.0 strategy, we 
announced plans to invest $20  billion to build two new fabs in Arizona, which we broke ground on in September, and we recently 
announced plan s to invest more than $20 billion in the construction of two new leading-edge fabs in Ohio , while actively searching for 
additional manufacturing locations in Europe. Our plans include utilizing a "smart capital" strategy in which we focus first on aggressively 
building out fab shells, which are the smaller portion of the overall cost of a fab but have the longest lead time, giving us flexibility in how 
and when we bring additional capacity and tools online. We also announced approximately $10.5 billion total investment to equip our Rio 
Rancho, New Mexico and Malaysia sites for advanced packaging manufacturing.
Note : The Dalian factory, presented above, was sold subsequent to year-end as part of the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND Memory business.

Human Capital
Our human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our IDM 2.0 strategy 
and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. We are committed to creating an 
inclusive workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the 
life of every person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce of 121,100  people through creating practices, programs and 
benefits that support the evolving world of work and our employees’ needs. 
Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our IDM 2.0 strategy. We are focused on reinvigorating 
our culture to strengthen our execution and accelerate our cadence of innovation. Our values— customer first, fearless innovation, results 
driven, one Intel, inclusion,  quality, and integrity —inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. This year, we added a new value—
results driven—as we seek to return to our roots of innovation and execution, making data-driven decisions quickly and setting disciplined 
goals that drive business results. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's Global 
Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.
"At Intel we tackle hard problems, think boldly, and create technology that improves the life of every 
person on the planet. Our culture unleashes the diverse perspectives, experiences, and potential of 
our employees to drive innovation and business results for Intel and our customers ."
—Christy Pambianchi , Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer
Talent Management
The digitization of everything is driving growth and global demand for semiconductors. Combined with the tightening labor market and 
economic recovery from COVID-19, this has driven a significant increase in competition throughout the industry to attract and retain talent 
– especially technical talent. In 2021, we intensified our efforts to continue to attract and retain talent, including introducing new employee 
referral programs, expanding wellness benefits and time off, heightening our focus on revitalizing our culture, and increasing mentoring in 
our technical community. In 2021, our undesired turnover rate1 was 5.6%, compared to 4.0% in 2020.
We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. 
We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities. We evolved our performance management system 
to support our culture evolution and increase our focus on disciplined goal setting and results. Through our annual Employee Experience 
Surveys and Manager Development Feedback Surveys, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their 
work experience, and learning and development opportunities.
Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion are core to Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation and positioning us 
for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and inclusion expectations 
into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus 
metrics. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we recognize 
we still have work to do, including beyond the walls of Intel. We also recognize the additional challenges 
that COVID-19 has presented to our employees, including women and individuals with disabilities. Our 
RISE strategy and 2030 goals set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including doubling the 
number of women in senior leadership; doubling the number of underrepresented minorities in US senior 
leadership; and embedding inclusive leadership practices across our business. Our goals also include 
increasing the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10%; and exceeding 
40% representation of women in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with 
technical job requirements. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and 
employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics. 
We have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work 
with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across 
industries. In 2021, we partnered with other technology companies to launch the Alliance for Global 
Inclusion to create and implement an Inclusion Index with unified goals and metrics. This collective effort 
will allow the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on closing persistent 
gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. We will also continue to 
collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, 
make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world.

Compensation and Benefits
We structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees. Our total rewards package includes market-
competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an e mployee stock purchase plan , healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time 
off and family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules , sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we 
have achieved gender pay equity  globally and we continue  to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US.  We achieve pay equity by 
closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for 
legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure.  We have also advanced 
transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019.  We believe that our holistic 
approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees 
develop and progress in their careers at all levels . Though flexible work schedules  are part of our existing total rewards package, the 
COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to further reimagine how our employees work and collaborate. In designing the future of our 
workplace, we surveyed employees around the globe to inform our “hybrid-first” approach, where the majority of our employees will split 
their time between working remotely and in the office, with no company-wide mandate on the number of days per week employees should 
be on-site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and on-site work where it drives the best output, while ensuring 
our employees have equitable access to systems, resources, and opportunities that allow them to succeed.
 
Health, Safety, and Wellness
Our commitment in Intel's Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace . We continually invest in 
programs designed to improve physical, mental, and socia l well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and 
convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers.  Throughout our response to COVID-19, our priority has 
remained protecting the health and safety of our employees.  This includes mental health , as we aim to increase awareness of and support 
for mental and behavioral health.  In support of our 2030 goals, we will continue to build our strong safety culture and drive global 
expansion of our corporate wellness program through employee education and engagement activities.
Social and Relationship Capital
We are committed to engaging in corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives that support our communities and help us develop 
trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, 
including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen  and 
create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities .
Economic and social.  The health of our business and local economies depends on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-
skill, high-paying jobs around the world. Many of these are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our own domestic and international 
factories. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, consumer spending by our employees, 
and t ax payments . We make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in  public-private partnerships to spur economic growth 
and innovation. We engage third-party organizations to conduct analyses of the economic impact of our operations, including a US impact 
study  in 2021 that found that for every US Intel job, Intel's economic activity in the US indirectly supports an additional 13 jobs. 
We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments 
around the world to solve global challenges. We also aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to create 
career pathways into the technology industry . This has included our global Intel Digital Readiness Programs,  such as  AI for Youth and AI 
for Workforce, scaled in partnership with governments and institutions to empower individuals with digital readiness and AI skills . 
Additionally, we have invested in multi-year partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities in the US to increase the number 
of Black/African  Americans who pursue electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and 
retirees share their expertise through volunteer initiatives in the communities where we operate, volunteering more than 1.71 million hours 
over the past two years. These efforts contribute to the 2030 goal we established last year to volunteer 10 million hours over a decade. 
COVID-19 presented challenges over the last two years for in-person volunteering , but we continued to see an outpouring of support from 
employees in 2021 for virtual volunteering, donations, and innovative technology projects to support our communities.  In 2020 we 
announced the Pandemic Response Technology Initiative to combat COVID-19. We expanded the initiative in 2021 and renamed it the 
RISE Technology Initiative to reflect a broader platform for action. It provides an expanded channel to build deeper relationships with our 
customers and partners aligned with our corporate purpose and work to create shared value through our 2030 RISE strategy. Specifically, 
we are funding projects in areas that include using technology to improve health and safety; making technology more inclusive while 
expanding digital readiness; and carbon neutral computing to help address climate change . 
Human rights commitment.  We are committed to maintaining and improving processes to avoid  complicity in human rights violations 
related to our operations, supply chain, and products . We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our 
business, including board-level oversight and the involvement of senior-level Management Review Committees. We also meet throughout 
the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight 
processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may 
develop, we do not tolerate our products being used to violate human rights. Where we become aware of a concern that our products are 
being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we restrict or cease business with the third party  until we 
have high confidence that our products are not being used to violate human rights .

Supply Chain Responsibility
We actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve 
overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices 
throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. 
We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate 
and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing  collaboration across our 
industry on responsible minerals sourcing.  Through these efforts we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit 
processes, and conduct training.
Over  the past decade, we have directly engaged with our suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and 
bonded labor and other human rights issue s. We perform supplier audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-
building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and our 
Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and 
supplier diversity.  To achieve our 2030 RISE goals, we will significantly expand the number of suppliers covered by our engagement 
activities.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation 
and value for our business. We have set additional  spending targets with women-owned suppliers outside the US and with minority-
owned suppliers globally to accelerate progress toward our goal to increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers by 100% to 
reach  $2 billion in annual spending by 2030 . Continuing  in 2022,  we wil l only retain or use outside law firms in the US that are above 
average on diversity for their equity partners. We are applying a similar rule to firms used by our tax department, including non-legal firms.
Natural Capital
Driving  to the lowest possible environmental footprint  as we grow helps us create efficiencies, lower costs, and respond to the needs of 
our stakeholders. We invest in conservation projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions, energy use, water use, and waste generation. We build energ y efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their 
own emissions and energy costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address 
environmental challenges.  Through our 2030 goals we will continue  to drive to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a goal of a 
further  10% reduction in our carbon emissions on an absolute basis even as we continue to grow. In 2021 , we continued  to take action on 
emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, additional investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment 
optimization, and energy conservation. Our 2030 strategy and goals also focus on improving product energy efficiency and increasing our 
"handprint"—the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions  that enable 
intelligence in machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. 
Climate and Energy
We focus on reducing our own climate impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct emissions and indirect emissions 
associated with energy consumption.  Through our 2030 goals we have committed to conserve an additional 4 billion kWh of energy over 
10 years. We have conserved  more than 310  million  kWh1 of energy since 2020. We also continue to link a portion of our executive  and 
employee performance bonus to our corporate sustainability metrics. In 2021, this included our target to save 125 million  kWh of energy  
during the year . We also invest in green power and on-site alternative energy projects in support of our 2030 goal to achieve 100% 
renewable energy use across our global manufacturing operations . We have reached  81%1 renewable energy globally . We are committed 
to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on 
climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an integrated approach 
to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and policies. Strategies and 
progress toward goals are reviewed with senior executives and the Intel Board of Directors' Corporate Governance and Nominating 
Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and describe our climate-related risks and 
opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, and " Risk Factors " within this Form 10-K. In 
addition to what is included within this Form 10-K, information about and progress toward our 2030 goals is included in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report. Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD , the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board framework, and our CDP Climate Change Survey, all of which are available on our website.2

Water Stewardship
Water is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and 
we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems.  Through our 2030 goals, we have committed to conserve an 
additional 60 billion gallons in this decade. As part of this commitment, we plan to achieve net positive water use globally.  We have 
conserve d 15.4 billion gallons1 of water and enabled restoration of 3.5 billion gallons1 of water since 2020.  In 2021,  we linked a portion  of 
our executive and employee performance bonus to our target s to conserve 7.5 billion gallons of water in our operations and complete 
projects to restore more than 1.5 billion gallons to local watersheds. 
Circular Economy and Waste Management
We have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies  that enable the recovery and productive 
re-use of waste streams.  Our 2030 goals include a target of zero total waste2 to landfill, as well as i mplementation of circular economy 
strategies for 60%  of our manufacturing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers . This can include reuse of waste streams directly 
in our own operations or enabling  reuse of our waste streams by other industries. Our 2030 goal of 60% will be challenging, given our 
projected operational growth  and new waste streams, suppliers, and locations that will require new circular economy strategies. We 
continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle waste by working further on waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers 
to evaluate new technolog ies for waste recovery.

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, t ime spent on PCs has increase d dramatically across all major  usage categories— as did PCs 
per household —reinforcing the importance of bringing  innovative platforms and form factors to market that unlock  real-world experiences. 
This trend is expected to remain in a post-pandemic wo rld, driving  a year over year growth in revenue TAM1. The ecosystem is shipping 
over one million PC units a day and we believe there is sustained strength in PC demand. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven 
significant behavior changes that have positioned the PC as an essential tool in people's lives. 
PC density, or PCs per household, is increasing as COVID-19 has irreversibly changed the way we focus, create, connect, and care for 
each other. In addition, we con tinue to see an increase in PCs per student . There is a significant opportunity in the commercial  segment , 
driven by refresh of older Windows devices. Currently, there are approximately 140 million devices that are more  than  four years old2. The 
experience and capabilities delivered on new PCs are dramatically better today , reinforcing the opportunity to drive a refresh cycle among 
enterprise customers . 
Products and Competition
We operate in a particularly competitive market. In processor s, we compete with AMD and vendors who design applications processors 
based on ARM* architecture, such as Qualcomm Inc. (Qualcomm ), and, increasingly, Apple  Inc., (Apple) with its most recent launch of M1 
Max and M1 Pro . We expect this competitive environment to intensify in 2022.
Our role as a technology leader is more important than ever, and our commitment to creating an open ecosystem is critical to delivering 
on our ambition. That is why we embrace and collaborate with a vibrant ecosystem of OEM partners to identify innovation vectors. The 
breadth of a robust ecosystem like Windows/x86 is an incredibly powerful combination, bringing together hundreds of companies and 
creative and innovative advancements that are  not possible  for one company alone to deliver.
We launched our 12th Gen Intel Core desktop processors based on our first performance hybrid architecture, which combines two all-new 
core microarchitectures instead of one and can scale across PC segments and out to the edge. The 12th Gen processor family is set to 
deliver superior computing performance for every PC segment and out to the edge.  In total, we expect to deliver more than 60 processors 
and 500  desktop and mobile designs from partners across major multinational corporations and leading manufacturers.
Unique to Intel , we innovate beyond the CPU to deliver  premium PC experiences with Intel Evo and Intel vPro platforms.  More than 100 
advanced laptop designs have been built on the Intel Evo platform, which signals they are tested and verified in Intel labs. This ensures 
they deliver key experience indicators defined by real-world usage models and innovation across areas like responsiveness, battery life, 
instant wake, and connectivity. Intel vPro is designed for enterprise needs and delivers increased productivity improvements, connectivity, 
security features, and remote manageability.
We are leading Intel as we embark on our new IDM 2.0 strategy  to develop more competitive products and more capabilities for 
customers. As a result, we are designing  our product roadmap to drive product leadership grounded in a philosophy of openness and 
choice. We deliver value to our customers by leveraging our engineering capabilities and working with our partners across an open, 
innovative ecosystem to deliver technology that drives every major vector of the computing experience, including performance, battery 
life, connectivity, graphics, and form factors to create the most advanced PC platforms. 
We continue to face industry-wide supply constraints, which are expected to persist into 2022 . Given our unique position in the industry, 
we have taken major actions along the supply chain to eliminate bottlenecks—increasing substrate capacity, removing third-party 
component bottlenecks, increasing our own internal capacity, and obtaining more external capacity. We are also working with the industry 
to provide TAM forecasts that help our suppliers better deliver on industry needs.

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
While the vehicle industry show s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic with approximately 2 %3 growth year over year,  production is still 
roughly 15%  below 2019 levels . We expect ADAS volume to overcome the COVID-19 effects faster than overall global vehicle production, 
given the significant growth shown in 2021.  We anticipate  long-term ADAS growth from a strong build-up in L1-L2 ADAS fitment rate s, 
increasing the number of vehicles that will have basic ADAS features from the factory. In addition, we expect increased demand for new 
generations of cloud-enhanced ADAS as OEMs continue to look to boost current L2 solutions by improving system fidelity, availability, and 
performance. A crucial building block for L4 autonomy, our REM high-definition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and crowd-
based semantics provide a unique value proposition for enhanced L2 systems. We see great traction from leading OEMs (including VW 
and Ford, as recently announced) as REM-based enhancements can be achieved based on economical configuration. 
We believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial services like Robotaxi and cargo, followed by series-
production passenger car consumer AVs. We expect consumer AVs to materialize only after the Robotaxi industry deploys and matures. 
The main inhibitors of a mass market product offering of consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, 
regulatory framework, public acceptance, and the ability to scale geographically. Thus, we see the Robotaxi phase as a necessary 
corridor to consumer AV. Because of our scalable approach, Mobileye is well-positioned to play a significant role in both the Robotaxi 
market and the future consumer AV market. This is driven by three elements in our strategy: lean compute enabled by the tight co-design 
of hardware and software, REM crowdsourced maps that provide unparalleled global coverage and constant updates, and development of 
high-resolution imaging radars to reduce the use of costly LiDAR sensors.

MD&A 28
In Robotaxi, Mobileye is active via two major business models: First, we are positioning ourselves to be an end-to-end service provider 
together with Moovit's complementary go-to-market assets and service layers. Second, w e are  also engaging  with various public 
transportation operators, goods delivery, and mobility providers via a Vehicle-as-a-Service business model in which we provide a fully 
integrated self-driving platform. 
Regulatory approval and  framework are a prerequisite for AV proliferation. In 2021, Germany became the first country in the world to allow 
autonomous vehicles onto public roads without requiring a human backup safety driver behind the wheel. We anticipate one or more  
additional countries will soon provide similar regulation, enabling regular deployment and operation of MaaS fleets with self-driving 
vehicles starting in 2022.
Products and  Competition
Our offering for ADAS and AV is propelled by our computer vision, AI expertise, and software assets, deployed on our EyeQ SoC family. 
The tight co-design of hardware and software gives the EyeQ SoC the ability to support complex and computationally intense tasks and 
sets it apart from competition because it is purpose-fit for high-compute, low-power, automotive-compliant mission profiles. Our 5th Gen 
EyeQ5 SoC is designed to act as the core building block of central compute for fully autonomous driving vehicles. We have been able to 
achieve power, performance, and cost targets by employing proprietary computational cores that are optimized for a wide variety of 
computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning tasks, including deep neural networks. Starting with EyeQ5, we are supporting 
an automotive-grade standard operating system and providing a complete software development kit to allow customers to differentiate 
their solutions by deploying their algorithms on EyeQ5. The EyeQ5 SoC is already available for commercial vehicles and is already 
operational in our autonomous test vehicles.
EyeQ5 serves as the computational foundation for our scalable camera-only surround sensing system. The system consists of multiple 
independent computer vision engines and deep networks for algorithmic redundancy. The result is a robust and comprehensive model of 
the environment that allows end-to-end autonomous driving. The surround computer vision system is the backbone of Mobileye's AV 
architecture and the flagship offering for next-generation ADAS.
We recently introduced EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H, which are designed to provide a scalable solution from entry level ADAS to L2+ and L4 
systems. The EyeQ6 platform opens Mobileye to host and process parking and DMS data. EyeQ6L is expected to be deployed  in 2023, 
while EyeQ6H will start production in 2024.
We also introduced the EyeQ® Ultra™, our most advanced, highest performing SoC purpose-built for autonomous driving. EyeQ Ultra 
maximizes  both performance and efficiency at 176 tera operations per second. This efficiently designed SoC builds on six generations of 
proven EyeQ architecture and four classes of proprietary accelerator cores to deliver the power and performance needed for AVs . The first 
silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC is expected at the end of 2023, with full automotive-grade production in 2025.
The next significant building block in our complete offering is REM mapping technology, which compiles crowdsourced mapping data from 
EyeQ SoC-equipped vehicles. Together with our OEM partners, we are utilizing our strong presence in ADAS to gain crowd knowledge 
that is required for building AV maps. After five years of intense development, the REM technology is fully functional for L2/L2+ 
applications and provides a variety of advanced features, including predictive adaptive cruise control, lane-level localization in all weather 
and road conditions, hands-free driving application, and real-time alerts. REM also provides intelligent speed adaptation functionality for 
regulation required by  GSR and EUNCA P starting in 2022. REM technology  is one of our key differentiators.
The third building block in our full stack offering is our unique formal model for AV safety (RSS). At its core, RSS is a pragmatic method to 
design and then efficiently validate  the safety of an AV, serving as the governing safety layer for the decision-making system. RSS 
formalizes human decision making for safe driving. It acknowledges the need to balance safety with useful driving by making plausible 
worst-case scenario assumptions for other road users. By using induction and analytical calculations, the RSS model allows for a lean 
driving policy with high computational efficiency. 
The fourth building block  is True Redundancy™, which manifests our approach to AV sensing. True Redundancy combines two 
independent perception sub-systems— one powered by cameras, and another by radar and LiDAR— and supports full end-to-end 
autonomous capabilities. Our Level 4 self-driving system, Mobileye Drive, incorporates both systems.
Our last building block is active sensors development. Mobileye and Intel's combined competencies put us in a unique position to advance 
with the development of a  software-defined imaging radar designed t o deliver rich point cloud modeling capabilities to enable sensing-
state and driving decisions solely on radar. Our  imaging radars would replace most of the field of view covered by today's costly LiDARs. 
LiDAR would be retained only for the front-facing field of view, where it would operate in three-way redundancy with cameras and radar, 
enabling a major cost reduction for the entire sensor configuration . The proof of concept and modelling using this new radar technology  
has already been demonstrated. We are also developing a unique Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave LiDAR designed to provide 
high point density with relative speed measurement and superior immunity for additional safety in time-critical decisions.Table of Contents

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
With the rise of pervasive connectivity and autonomous transactions, vast networks of devices and systems are linked from the edge 
through infrastructure to the cloud. Our FPGA and structured ASIC technologies enhance Intel's ability to meet the needs of customers in 
the data center, across the network, and at the edge by extending platform capabilities, intercepting evolving requirements when 
standards are still changing, and enabling customers to validate next-generation technology proof points early in the market transition. 
The Intel FPGA portfolio enables this transformation with discrete FPGAs and software-defined, hardware-based, multi-function 
acceleration cards and IPUs that allow faster development times, high performance, and power efficiency with lower overall total cost of 
ownership.
We enable a broad range of solutions targeting applications across our embedded, communications, and cloud and enterprise market 
segments. The configurability and efficiency of FPGAs provide advantages to enable transformative applications such as 5G wireless, 
network function virtualization acceleration, and edge acceleration for video analytics and Industry 4.0. At the edge, where systems ingest 
large amounts of data, Intel FPGAs are ideal for pre-processing data to accelerate Intel processors. In the network, where data traffic is 
increasing and network functions are being virtualized to improve transport efficiency, Intel FPGAs are built to deliver high-bandwidth 
aggregation and processing. In the cloud, where workloads shift dynamically and algorithms change, Intel FPGAs are the ideal solution for 
adapting to new demands through reconfigurability  and enabling the offload of infrastructure processing tasks from CPUs as part of an 
IPU platform .
Prod ucts and Competition
We deliver solutions in the PLD market, primarily FPGAs and structured ASICs, to accelerate applications that help secure, power, and 
connect billions of devices and the infrastructure of the smart, connected, data-centric world. We face competition from other 
programmable logic companies, as well as companies that make other types of semiconductor products, such as ASICs, application-
specific standard products, GPUs, digital signal processors, and CPUs. Targeted growth areas for our programmable solutions include 
5G, AI, intelligent edge, and cloud applications. The FPGA life cycle generally takes three or more years from the time that a design win is 
secured before a customer starts volume production and we receive the associated revenue.
We continue to leverage our heterogeneous architecture on advanced nodes to deliver 
innovative products at an accelerated pace, allowing the integration of analog, 
memory, custom computing, custom I/O, and Intel eASIC chiplets into a single 
package. Our Intel Agilex FPGA family, built on Intel 10nm SuperFin technology, is now 
shipping. The Agilex family delivers leading performance and power efficiency for 
diverse workloads.
We continue to invest in our Intel eASIC portfolio. Our Intel eASIC N5X, the next-
generation Intel eASIC device, is now in production. Structured ASIC products serve as 
an intermediary technology between FPGAs and standard-cell ASICs that provides 
lower unit cost and lower power compared to FPGAs, and faster time-to-market and 
lower non-recurring engineering cost compared to standard-cell ASICs. Intel eASIC 
products have growth opportunities through adoption in 5G applications and scale 
across a wide range of markets.
We continue to execute to our developer-first strategy with oneAPI support for several 
Intel FPGA families and the Intel® FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card. The 
oneAPI programming model allows users to save significant development time and 
enhance productivity while using a single, unified language for CPUs, GPUs, and 
FPGAs.
We introduced several new platforms, solutions, and partnerships during the year. We 
announced Arrow Creek, an FPGA-based Acceleration Development Platform 
SmartNIC adapter that can flexibly accelerate several infrastructure workloads and 
enable high-performance 100G connectivity by combining Intel’s Agilex FPGA and the 
Intel Ethernet 800 Series controller. We introduced RedHat support for Intel Open 
FPGA Stack, further enabling solution and board providers to build their own 
differentiated FPGA platforms for servers with Intel Xeon CPUs. We also announced 
with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency a three-year partnership to 
advance the development of domestically manufactured structured ASIC platforms.  
Intel FPGAs play a critical role in Intel’s announced IPU vision, enabling cloud and 
communications service providers to reduce overhead and free up performance for 
CPUs. Intel FPGA-based IPU platforms are currently deployed at multiple cloud 
service providers. We also announced Oak Springs Canyon, an IPU reference platform 
built with our Intel Xeon D processor and our Intel Agilex FPGA.Table of Contents

2021 vs. 2020
In 2021 , revenue was $79.0 billion , up $1.2 billion , or 1%, from 2020 . CCG revenue grew 1% due to continued strength in notebook 
demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market 
segments. CCG adjacent revenue decreased primarily due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem and 
Home Gateway Platform businesses. IOTG and Mobileye were both up 33% and 43%, respectively, on higher demand amid recovery 
from the economic impacts of COVID-19. DCG revenue decreased  1% primarily due to lower ASPs driven by product mix and a 
competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment. NSG 
revenue decreased  primarily driven by lower ASPs due to market softness and pricing p ressure . Our "all other" revenue increased 
primarily due to $584 million  from a prepaid customer supply agreement settled in Q1 2021 for which we recognized related revenue for 
completing performance.
We saw impacts from ongoing industry component , substrate, and foundry silicon shortages across a majority of our businesses and we 
expect these constraints to continue.  
2020 vs. 2019
In 2020 , revenue was $77.9 billion , up $5.9 billion , or 8%, from 2019 . Our DCG revenue grew 11% due to increased platform volume as 
cloud service providers increased capacity to serve customer demand. We also saw continued growth in DCG communications service 
providers, partially offset by enterprise and government decline. We saw growth in DCG adjacencies driven by 5G networking deployment 
and saw improved NAND pricing and higher demand in NSG, partially offset by weaker core mix and higher demand in IOTG platform 
products due to COVID-19. Our CCG revenue was up 8% year over year driven by strength in notebook and Wi-Fi sales. That growth was 
slightly offset by lower desktop volume and lower notebook ASPs resulting from higher demand for consumer and education PCs, and 
volume decline in LTE modem and connected home following the exit of those businesses. Table of Contents

Our effective tax rate decreased  in 2021  compared to 2020 , primarily driven by one-time tax benefits due to the restructuring of certain 
non-US subsidiaries as well as a higher proportion of our income in n on-U S jurisdictions.  As a result of the restructuring, we established 
deferred tax assets and released the valuation allowances of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets 
established in 2021 fully offset the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2020 driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion 
with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of our planned divestiture of our NAND memory business.  
Our effective tax rate increased in 2020  compared to 2019 , primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with 
respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of our planned  divestiture of our NAND memory business.  It also increased due to 
the reduction in our foreign derived intangible income benefit in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash 
generated by operations , supplemented by our t otal cash and investments1, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic 
business requirements . Our short-term requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, 
including investments in our process technology roadmap ; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, 
and dividends. Our long-term requirements incrementally contemplate additional investments in the significant manufacturing expansion 
plans we announced as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy and additional investments  to accelerate our process technology. These plans include 
investment to build two new fabs in Arizona as well as plans for a next phase of capacity expansions in Ohio , Europe, and other global 
locations. Our plans include  utilizing a "smart capital" strategy in which we focus first on aggressively building out fab shells, which are the 
smaller portion of the overall cost of a fab but have the longest lead time, giving us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity 
and tools online. Additionally, as we have faced industry shortages of substrates and other components, we have increasingly entered into 
long-term agreements with suppliers and foundry service providers, some of which involve prepayments that will help us secure future 
supply. 
As we invest in these expansions and in the acceleration of our process technology roadmap, we expect our capital expenditures to 
increase above historical levels for the next several years . The prepayments  for future supply of substrates and other components 
accelerate cash outflows into the near term, and we expect to apply the prepayments to future purchases, resulting in a positive impact on 
our liquidity in subsequent periods . 
We expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. As of December 25, 2021  we had 
commitments for capital expenditures of $22.3 billion  for 2022, and we expect our total capital expenditures for 2022 to be above that 
amount. We also had $4.6 billion  in capital expenditures committed in the long term.  As of December 25, 2021 , other purchase obligations 
and commitments in 2022 under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $3.1 billion  with an additional $9.3 
billion  committed in the long term.
We have additional obligation s as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other 
purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see " Note 19: Commitments and 
Contingencies " within Consolidated Financial Statements  for information about our lease obligations, which include supply agreements 
structured as leases, " Note 8: Income Taxes " within Consolidated Financial Statements  for information about our tax obligations related to 
Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings, and " Note 13: Borrowings " within 
Consolidated Financial Statements  for information about our long-term debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our 
obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the 
timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing 
requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these requirements 
are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.
We anticipate that we will continue to primarily  rely on operating cash flows, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, to fund 
IDM 2.0 and other cash requirements in the ordinary course of business. We also expect to benefit from government incentives under 
pending legislation, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 
investments.  Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements. We expect our increased 
capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. When assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total 
cash and investments1 as shown in the following table:

Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the 
SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, 
we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion . During 2021 , we issued a total of $5.0 billion  
aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and entered into a $5.0 billion  variable-rate revolving credit facility that matures in March 
2026 . We repaid $500 million  of our 1.70%  senior notes that matured in May 2021 and $2.0 billion  of our 3.30%  senior notes that matured 
in October 2021. As of December 25, 2021 , we had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowing on the revolving credit facility.
We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all  of our 
investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade securities.
In the  first quarter of 2021 , we repurchased the remaining $2.4 billion  in shares of our planned $20.0 billion share  repurchases announced 
in October 2019. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years.  
Sources and Uses of Cash
(In Millions)
Table of Contents
MD&A 43
In summary , our cash flows for each period were  as follows :
Years Ended (In Millions) Dec 25, 2021 Dec 26, 2020 Dec 28, 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 29,991 $ 35,384 $ 33,145 
Net cash used for investing activities  (25,167)  (20,796)  (14,405) 
Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities  (5,862)  (12,917)  (17,565) 
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,038) $ 1,671 $ 1,175 
Operating Activities
Cash provided by  operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
For 2021  compared to 2020 , the $5.4 billion  decrease  in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in net 
working capital contributions and cash paid to settle a prepaid customer supply  agreement in Q1 2021, partially offset by a McAfee special 
dividend received in Q3 2021 .
For 2020  compared to 2019 , the $2.2 billion  increase  in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working 
capital. Changes in working capital were driven by accounts receivable, inventory, and income taxes, offset by other assets and liabilities.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals, and proceeds from 
divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.  Our capital expenditures were $18.7 billion  in 2021  ($14.3 billion  in 2020  and $16.2 billion  in 
2019 ). 
The increase  in cash used for investing activities in 2021  compared to 2020  was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures, 
partially offset by a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments.
The increase  in cash used for investing activities in 2020  compared to 2019  was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-
for-sale debt investments and trading assets, offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale debt investments and 
trading assets, and a decrease in capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, 
repurchases of common stock, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
The decrease  in cash used for financing activities in 2021  compared to 2020  was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common 
stock and a decrease in repayments of debt and debt conversions, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by long-term debt 
issuances.
During 2021 , we repurchased $2.4 billion  of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $14.2 
billion  in 2020 . Our total dividend payments were $5.6 billion  in 2021  compared to $5.6 billion  in 2020 . We have paid a cash dividend in 
each of the past 117 quarters. 
The decrease  in cash used for financing activities in 2020  compared to 2019  was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by long-
term debt issuances, offset by an increase in repayments of debt and debt conversions and an increase in repurchases of common stock.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding 
matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that 
were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate 
methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial 
Statements . While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available 
when the estimate was made.Table of Contents
MD&A 44
Refer to " Note 2: Accounting Policies " within the Consolidated Financial Statements  for further information on our critical accounting 
estimates and policies, which are as follows :
▪Inventories —the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory , excluding factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the 
lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market conditions; 
▪Long-lived assets —the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property, plant and equipment, 
identified intangibles, and goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings  and the identification and allocation of goodwill to 
reporting units;
▪Non-marketable equity investments —the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments; and
▪Loss contingencies —the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial 
measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our 
operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of 
business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and 
measuring our performance. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our annual 
cash bonus plan.
Long-term gross margin outlook range is provided on a non-GAAP basis and excludes the impact of amortization of acquisition-related 
intangible assets  and share-based compensation expense . We are unable to provide a full reconciliation of this measure to the 
corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, as the amount and timing of such adjustments on a long-term basis are 
subject to considerable uncertainty . We believe such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this 
forward-looking measure. 
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax 
effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP 
financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, 
and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.
NAND memory 
businessOur NAND memory business is subject to a pending sale 
to SK hynix, as announced in October 2020. While the 
second closing of the sale is still pending, we completed 
the first closing on December 29, 2021, subsequent to 
our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our 
ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first 
quarter of 2022. We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in 
certain non-GAAP measures. While the second closing 
of the sale is still pending and subject to closing 
conditions, management does not currently view the 
business as part of the company’s core operations or its 
long-term strategic direction. We believe these 
adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through 
the eyes of management, of the company’s core 
business model and how management currently 
evaluates core operational performance. We believe they 
also provide investors with an additional means to 
understand the potential impact of the divestiture over 
time. In making these adjustments, we have not made 
any changes to our methods for measuring and 
calculating revenue or other financial statement amounts.
Acquisition-related 
adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 
consists of amortization of intangible assets such as 
developed technology, brands, and customer 
relationships acquired in connection with business 
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of 
these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales 
and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. 
Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated 
useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and 
thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-
related intangible assets for purposes of calculating 
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are 
inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the 
timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These 
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current 
operating performance and comparison to our past 
operating performance and provide investors with 
additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.Non-GAAP 
adjustment or 
measure Definition Usefulness to management and investorsTable of Contents
MD&A 45
Restructuring and 
other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a formal 
restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee 
severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges 
include a charge related to the VLSI litigation, goodwill 
and asset impairments, pension charges, and costs 
associated with restructuring activity.We exclude restructuring and other charges, including 
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because these costs do not reflect our core operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our core operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results and provide 
investors with additional means to evaluate expense 
trends.
(Gains) losses 
from divestitureGains or losses are recognized in connection with a 
divestiture.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because they do not reflect our current operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our current operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results.
Ongoing mark-to-
market on 
marketable equity 
securitiesAfter the initial mark-to-market adjustment is recorded 
upon a security becoming marketable, gains and losses 
are recognized from ongoing mark-to-market 
adjustments of our marketable equity securities. We exclude these ongoing gains and losses for purposes 
of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we 
do not believe this volatility correlates to our core 
operational performance. These adjustments facilitate a 
useful evaluation of our current operating performance 
and comparisons to past operating results. 
Free cash flow We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of free 
cash flow, which is used by management when 
assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and 
quality of earnings. Free cash flow is operating cash flow 
adjusted to exclude additions to property, plant and 
equipment.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in 
understanding our capital requirements and provides an 
additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our 
business. We exclude additions to held for sale NAND 
property, plant and equipment because the additions are 
not representative of our long-term capital requirements 
and these assets were sold upon the first closing of the 
transaction that occurred on December 29, 2021, 
subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. 
Total cash and 
investmentsTotal cash and investments is used by management 
when assessing our sources of liquidity, which includes 
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, 
trading assets, other long-term investments, and loans 
receivable and other.This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our

Other Key Information
Sales and Marketing
Customers
We sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to 
branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as 
industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud  service providers, who buy our products through distributor, 
reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted 
for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see " Note 3: Operating Segments " within the Consolidated Financial Statements .
Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers ; systems  builders that purchase Intel processors  and 
other products from our distributors. We have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in 
small quantities to systems integrators. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.
Sales Arrangements
Our products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order 
acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as 
indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities . Because our customers generally order from us 
on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and 
without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our 
standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using 
electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods 
ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other 
incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.
In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to 
the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms.  Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that 
payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days  after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative 
analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support 
protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.  Credit losses may still be incurred 
due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. 
Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on 
stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between 
the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price 
protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of 
a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the 
distributor. 
Distribution
Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. 
Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity 
to key customers.
Seasonal Trends
Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the 
third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2021, c ontinued strong COVID -driven notebook demand in the first half of the year 
contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. 
Marketing
Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives 
preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid 
businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, 
Celeron®, Pentium®, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year, we introduced the Intel Arc brand for our 
upcoming high-performance graphics products .Table of Contents
Other Key Information 48
We promote  brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing 
programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer 
and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations . We market to consumer and business audiences and 
focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved 
energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity .
Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs 
broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on 
computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The 
program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined 
criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. 
We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management 
programs are designed to reduce, but may not eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on 
sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 25, 2021  and December 26, 2020 . Actual results may differ 
materially. 
Currency Exchange Rates
We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments  and loans 
receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest 
rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related 
hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-US-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness  and may use 
foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.
Substantially all  of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a significant  portion of our operating expenditures and capital 
purchases are incurred in other currencies , primarily the European Union euro, the Israeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the Japanese yen, 
and the Chinese yuan . We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks 
associated with non-US dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge 
currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as 
currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs.  We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and 
determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be 
experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded 
monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 25, 2021  and December 26, 2020 , would result in an adverse impact on 
income before taxes of less than  $38 million  and less than $61 million , respectively .
Interest Rates
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our 
investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally 
track the US dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt 
investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into US dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We also enter into swaps to 
convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these 
instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.
A hypothetical increase in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a decrease 
in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $68 million  as of December 25, 2021  (a hypothetical decrease of 1% would 
have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $75 million  as of December 26, 2020 ).
Taking into account floating-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 
1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $132 million  from debt outstanding as of December 25, 2021  
(a hypothetical increase of 1% would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $132 million  from debt 
outstanding as of December 26, 2020 ). 
Equity Prices
We are exposed to equity market risk through our  investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce 
or eliminate through hedging activities. Table of Contents
Other Key Information 49
As of December 25, 2021 , the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $2.2 billion  ($1.8 billion  as of December 26, 2020 ). The 
substantial majority  of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 25, 2021  was concentrated in securities traded on the 
Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board.  To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market 
value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 
60% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $1.3 billion , based on the 
value as of December 25, 2021  (a decrease in value of approximately  $1.1 billion , based on the value as of December 26, 2020  using an 
assumed decline of 60%). 
We utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation 
arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the 
related liabilities.
Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, 
although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the 
companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through 
liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and 
there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our 
investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.1 billion  as of December 25, 2021  ($3.3 billion  as of 
December 26, 2020 ) and include s our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion  ($658 million  as of December 26, 2020 ). 
Commodity Price Risk
Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We 
have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use 
commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that 
are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. 
Risk Factors
When any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and 
results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors 
do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently 
consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a 
reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also 
to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K , including in the MD&A  and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details  sections.
Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. 
Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our 
products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to 
grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; 
however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize or we may fail to 
capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products, can reduce our revenue, 
lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.
Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:
▪business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;
▪consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, 
including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, 
employment, and energy or other commodity prices;
▪geopolitical conditions, including trade policies;
▪our ability to timely introduce competitive products; 
▪competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;
▪the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;
▪customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' 
products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the ongoing 
industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;
▪market acceptance and industry support of our products, including the introduction and availability of software and other products 
used together with our products; and
▪customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user 
computing workloads, such as work- and learn-from-home trends.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 50
Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may 
incur significant charges and costs.  Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are 
fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and 
equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to 
forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross 
margin. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we 
may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful 
lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. As we make substantial investments in increasing our 
manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened.  Conversely, at times demand 
increases or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or 
increase production fast enough, we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, 
which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships . 
Our IDM 2.0 investments in capacity and our process technology roadmap will require capital expenditures above our historical levels, 
and if demand for our IFS business grows rapidly, we anticipate that we would need to accelerate our planned investments to meet that 
demand. To the extent we do not generate expected cash flows, we may be required to increase our use of external funding sources to 
fund our investments and operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. There is legislation under consideration in 
the US and EU to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions , but there can be no 
assurance that such funding will be enacted, and there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to 
any restrictions on recipients. To the extent such funding is below  our expectations, our anticipated cash requirements would increase.   
Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such 
sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or 
approvals; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects.
We face significant competition.  The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market 
developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent 
product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can 
weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and we 
expect it to continue to do so in the future.
Our products primarily  compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload 
optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap 
execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and 
market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements 
and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business, for 
example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive 
factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive 
landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.
We face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; 
accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific 
standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. 
Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, 
and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and 
application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and 
servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed 
semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically 
integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For 
example, in 2020,  Apple  introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our 
client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.
Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) or Samsung 
Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. 
Manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive 
offerings by our competitors. While we have set out a process technology roadmap to attain future process performance-per-watt parity 
and leadership relative to TSMC, our plans are subject to a number of risks and we could fail to realize our goals, including due to 
changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and 
the risks described in the section "We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks." As an IDM, we have higher capital 
expenditures and R&D spending than many of our "fabless" competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes 
in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which 
could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's 
programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 51
Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand 
for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business . For example, our DCG revenue 
and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021.  Additionally, a number of business 
combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in 
the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreemen t to 
acquire Xilinx, Inc . Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our 
financial results.
If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and 
we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.
We invest significantly in R&D, and to the extent our R&D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may 
not realize a return on our investments.  To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and 
manufacturing processes , and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&D efforts 
across several key areas , including process and packaging technology, our  xPU products and features, and software. These include 
ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools.  We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the 
benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, 
and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To 
the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or 
transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face 
cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new 
products,  including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges.  To the extent our 
R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, 
and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We 
have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be 
manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces 
new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of 
which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated 
designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component 
design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the 
associated product.
We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies 
fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant 
investments in R&D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not 
contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even 
cover the costs of such investments. 
Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new 
areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud 
to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete 
GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our 
IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, 
establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to 
compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing 
processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; 
customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our "big bets" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, 
we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to 
profitability for the business. 
These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce 
new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer 
bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant 
investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate 
return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to 
develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our 
investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to 
the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to 
cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings.  Despite our ongoing 
efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these 
various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring 
charges, as well as opportunity costs.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 52
Changes in the mix of products sold can materially impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and 
market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our 
platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end 
platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced 
platform products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in 
any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent a greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage 
may decrease.
We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.
We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technologies.  Production of integrated 
circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly 
advanced nodes as we seek to realize the benefits of Moore's Law. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced 
nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the 
manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our 
manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the 
effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially understood. 
We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We 
experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode  in the 
development of our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. These delays have 
allowed competitors using third-party foundries such as TSMC to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced 
ahead of us by foundries, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the 
competitiveness of their products. Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience greater adverse 
competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products. 
Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-
generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of 
the technology introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, 
including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and 
R&D investments, particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be 
required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.
Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated 
manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, 
and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can 
result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation 
process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing 
supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to 
previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing 
supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher 
depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. As the die size of 
our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown 
increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and 
lower yields.
From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising permits and 
licenses, interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment, adverse changes in equipment productivity, and 
disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment 
malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues 
periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the 
results of operations. In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose revenue 
opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development 
stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.
We face supply chain risks.  We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide 
direct materials for our production processes ; supply tools, equipment, and IP for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; 
and supply software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business.  We also rely on suppliers to provide 
certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From time to time 
we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including the following:
▪suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers 
including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;
▪supplier quality issues;
▪cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, manmade or natural disasters, operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;
▪long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; andTable of Contents
Other Key Information 53
▪increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, or supplier conduct that does not meet 
such standards, which can cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation.
These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us 
from meeting customer demand, and damage our customer relationships. They may keep us from successfully implementing our 
business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition. From time to 
time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During 
2021, the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry 
manufacturing capacity, and we anticipate that such shortages will continue in 2022. These shortages have limited our ability to supply 
customer demand in certain of our businesses, such as for our  PSG products , and have adversely affected customer demand for our 
products, including in our CCG and DCG businesses, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party 
components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these ongoing 
shortages.
To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we 
have increasingly entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large 
prepayments. These arrangements could still prove inadequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed 
volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of these arrangements 
falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments 
may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable. 
We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as  
networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect 
to increase our use of third-party foundries for manufacturing, which will include modular tiles manufactured on advanced foundry process 
technologies for use in our core computing offerings. Delays in the development of foundries’ future manufacturing processes could delay 
the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting 
customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing 
yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties.  
Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials , and equipment, we 
rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. For example, ASML  is currently the sole supplier of 
EUV photolithography tools that we will be deploying in our Intel 4 and other future manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly 
complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their 
development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example,  a limited 
number of third-party foundries offer lea ding-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. 
Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers. Sole- or limited-source suppliers can impact the 
nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us and intensify the other risks described in this risk factor.
Our disaggregated design strategy introduces additional production risks. Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical 
risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, 
including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a 
timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and 
capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues 
with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to 
combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are 
unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.
We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues.  From time to time, we identify product defects, errata 
(deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our 
manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain 
through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-
party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal 
injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are 
introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, 
communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. 
Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:
▪writing off some or all of the value of inventory;
▪recalling products that have been shipped;
▪providing product replacements or modifications;
▪providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;
▪defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and
▪paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 54
These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation 
techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or 
at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as 
hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent 
development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues 
and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or 
unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or 
change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. Product issues can damage our reputation, 
negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, 
which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of 
the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities 
incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which 
could harm our financial condition.
We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to 
our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact 
with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard 
specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are 
being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and 
process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The 
security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred 
to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown." Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. 
Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third 
parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely 
secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. 
Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always 
promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a 
vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a 
security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of 
additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer 
satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.
Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative 
measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve 
vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services 
vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and 
performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, 
when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. We and  such third parties  make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to 
address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities 
and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of 
functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the 
applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.
Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, 
financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, 
whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to 
developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, 
responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product 
replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities 
or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may 
be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively 
mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before 
mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, 
or otherwise harm our business and reputation. 
We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations.  The manufacturing and assembly and test of our 
products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and 
regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of 
production; alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations 
or sales. In addition, failure to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 55
Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to 
increased costs or future liabilities. E nvironmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements , may impede our ability to 
expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire 
additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Regulations in response to 
climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For exampl e, semiconductor 
manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or 
increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional 
abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter our production processes. In addition, new or increased climate change 
regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. As we expand our 
manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we 
are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm 
our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test 
processes.
The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of 
operations. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected significant portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition and results of operations. Authorities have imposed, and businesses and individuals have implemented , 
numerous measures to try to contain the virus or treat its impact, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter -in-place/stay-
at-home and social distancing orders, shutdowns, and vaccine requirements. These measures have impacted and may further impact our 
workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective suppliers and partners. We have experienced, 
and could in the future experience, reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some 
of our suppliers. We have significant manufacturing operations in the US, Ireland, Israel, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and each of these 
countries is taking measures in response to the pandemic. Restrictions on our manufacturing or support operations or workforce, similar 
limitations for our suppliers, and transportation restrictions or disruptions can limit our ability to meet customer demand and could have a 
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our customers have experienced, and may in the future 
experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or cancelled orders, or collection 
risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. 
The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including with respect to employee travel; employee work locations; 
cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences; and social distancing measures. As a US federal government 
contractor, we are subject to a federal executive order requiring our US employees to be vaccinated unless they qualify for medical or 
religious exemptions. The order has been challenged in court and its ultimate status, and the impact on our business, is uncertain. 
However, this requirement or other future vaccine mandates could adversely affect our workforce retention and hiring. Similarly, this 
requirement would apply to our suppliers working at our US sites, and to the extent such suppliers refuse to comply or decline to work with 
us based on the requirement or other future vaccine mandates, our business may be adversely affected, including higher costs or delays 
for our construction projects. We may take further actions as required by government authorities or others, or that we determine are in the 
best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, and partners. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional 
operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, validation, and 
qualification, customer support, and other activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty 
that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to 
unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions.
The pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has led to volatility in capital markets and credit 
markets. Risks related to adverse changes in global economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled "Global or regional 
conditions can harm our financial results," and include the risk that demand for our products will be significantly harmed. Given the 
continued and substantial economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of 
impacts on demand for our products. For example, the increased demand for notebook products as a result of work- and learn-from-home 
dynamics may not continue as the pandemic progresses .
The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the duration and severity of the pand emic ; the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact; other actions taken 
by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the virus and resulting economic disruption; and how quickly and to what 
extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to 
respond to effectively. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, and other 
partners, but a material effect on these parties could also materially adversely affect us. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate 
other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section and throughout this report.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 56
We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.
Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results.  We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations 
in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US 
accounted for 82% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021 , with revenue from billings to China contributing  27% of 
our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, 
develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors 
outside of our control. 
Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth, changes or 
uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses 
including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending.  Adverse changes in economic 
conditions, i ncluding those related to the COVID-19 pandemic , can significantly harm demand for our products and make i t more 
challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our 
business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs 
or reduced availability of capital and credit markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties 
including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.
We can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:
▪geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and 
terrorist activity, including, for example, geopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters 
and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;
▪natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic) , and other catastrophic events;
▪inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of 
services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;
▪formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and 
changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;
▪government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from 
a particular country;
▪adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives 
provided to competitors;
▪differing employment practices and labor issues;
▪ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;
▪local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;
▪continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U S and abroad; and
▪fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit 
deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.
We are also  subject to risks related to the cessation of US dollar LIBOR. Certain of our derivatives and floating-rate investments reference 
US dollar LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on US dollar LIBOR. No new 
US dollar LIBOR-based activity should be conducted after 2021, and US dollar LIBOR will be unavailable for use in our existing contracts 
and financial instruments beyond June 30, 2023. While reasonable alternatives to LIBOR have been introduced into markets, our 
transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates could result in an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest 
income.
We are subject to risks related to trade policies and regulations. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade 
barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce 
demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or 
slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade 
policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our 
products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. 
In particular, trade tensions between the US and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to 
some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. The US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated 
products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced 
our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance , result  in reputational harm to us, or lead 
such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions 
governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short 
notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions. Table of Contents
Other Key Information 57
Trade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence 
and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with 
us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, and decoupling of 
global trade networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.
Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business.  We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among 
jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export 
requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization requirements; 
competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. 
Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For 
example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and 
MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. 
Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers 
and their products and services, particularly  in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our 
products used for those workloads.
Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance 
that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can 
result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to 
our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to 
government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.
We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency 
exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the 
dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the US where we sell in dollars, and a 
weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital 
expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to 
offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can 
harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.  Our operations and business, and those of 
our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues (including the COVID-19 
pandemic) ; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; 
manufacturing equipment failures; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our 
manufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or 
components, including due to cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities 
are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters 
occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the 
availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities, including facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as 
Arizona and Israel. In addition, to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be 
harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the US has experienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major 
manufacturing facilities. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are 
unclear, but could be severe. 
Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials 
from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and 
expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we 
cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover 
quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced 
or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.
We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we 
obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and 
broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by 
insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 58
Damage to our reputation can damage our business.  Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, 
governments, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise 
to reputational risk, including those described throughout this Risk Factors section, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. 
Our reputation can be impacted by catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic); incidents involving unethical 
behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal control failures; corporate 
governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; our response to climate change, including our 
greenhouse gas emission levels; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications, including AI and machine learning 
applications that present ethical, regulatory, or other issues; marketing practices; media statements;  the conduct of our suppliers or 
representatives; and other issues, incidents, or statements that , whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. To the extent we 
fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our 
reputation and our brands and could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or 
restrictions. 
Damage  to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could 
reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when 
competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.
We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.
We face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.  We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the 
Internet, or to introduce malicious software, to our IT systems. Individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored 
organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times 
attempt to gain unauthorized access and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our 
associated software and services. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and 
organizations that intend to sabotage, compromise, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, 
and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our 
suppliers, customers, partners, or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, and 
customers; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such 
systems and services. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the 
affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our 
manufacturing operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can 
experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our 
systems and our proprietary or confidential information.
From time to time , we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure, as well as those 
of third parties who provide products and services to us. For example,  in the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s network 
was breached, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information, in connection with a suspected unsuccessful 
ransomware attack. The breach was confined to our subsidiary's network and has not had a material impact on Habana Labs’ business. 
We are also subject to risks associated with attacks involving our supply chain, such as the compromise of IT infrastructure management 
software provided by SolarWinds Corporation, reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. During 2021, we have observed an increase in 
ransomware attacks in our supply chain. I n December 2021, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java 
logging library, Apache Log4j 2. We have reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our IT environment 
and have taken steps to mitigate the vulnerability.  To date,  cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our 
business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Such incidents, whether or not successful, 
could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, writing down inventory value, 
implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, 
responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, 
or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, 
thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. As a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to our systems has increased significantly, which also increases our 
cybersecurity attack surface. We have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication driven by the global 
enablement of remote workforces. W e seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, 
and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools and 
changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats.  In 
some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of an incident or its 
magnitude and effects. There is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, 
which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 59
Theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our 
reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.  The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by 
us to run our business, including data stored with vendors or other third parties, could result in significantly increased business and 
security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. We anticipate that our collection of such personal data will increase as we enter 
into the MaaS market in our Mobileye business, and it may increase as we enter into other new or adjacent businesses. Global privacy 
legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. 
Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could 
expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and 
even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws 
and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.
We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
We cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights.  We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as 
important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, 
employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to 
general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to obtain 
protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. 
When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing 
party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time 
to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or 
governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these 
circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our 
innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could 
harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product 
development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our 
employees .
Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. 
Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of 
our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of 
the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to  licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards 
organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard 
specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant 
licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the 
value of our IP rights may be impaired.
Third  parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business.  We face claims based on IP 
rights from individuals, companies, non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties, including claims from 
those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other 
companies. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, 
increasing the number of parties who own IP rights previously all held by a single party. We have seen an increase in patent assertions 
and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by investment firms and other third parties. In some 
instances, these entities have filed multi-jurisdiction litigation seeking large monetary damages and/or injunctions against us. These 
lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. 
For example, in the multi-jurisdiction litigation brought against us by VLSI, a jury in one of the pending U S federal court cases returned a 
verdict in February 2021 awarding approximately $2.2 billion in damages to VLSI, as discussed in Note 19: Commitments and 
Contingencies  within the Consolidated Financial Statements. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to 
the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters, including the 
availability of injunctive relief for non-practicing entities, and the US Patent and Trademark Office’s reduction of inter partes patent review  
under the America Invents Act. As a result, we believe we are facing a more hostile IP litigation environment.
We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP 
rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the 
efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims 
based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information , or end-user data that we 
obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, 
including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain 
IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' 
businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.
As a result of IP rights claims, we could:
▪pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, or penalties;
▪stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims; Table of Contents
Other Key Information 60
▪need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or
▪enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.
These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop 
production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.
We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  Many of our products are 
designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, 
from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that necessary licenses to such 
third-party IP can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that our existing licenses to third-party IP will continue to be 
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on 
commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our 
financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source 
software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source 
licensing terms.
We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time,  we face legal claims or regulatory matters 
involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance , and other issues on a global basis. As 
described in "Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of 
litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings, excessive verdicts, or 
other events could occur, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain 
products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable 
outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the 
outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and 
distracting to management.
We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. 
Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. The 
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is increasingly intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire 
our employees, and the increased availability of work-from-home arrangements, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has both 
intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair 
our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. We have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent. These efforts 
have increased our expenses , and they may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver 
on our strategy. Changes in employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and 
less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-
based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price, or lower stock price 
performance relative to competitors, can reduce the retention value of our share-based awards. Our employee hiring and retention also 
depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the 
extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate 
employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations . 
Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business. For example, we appointed a new CEO effective in February 2021 and 
a new CFO in January 2022 and made several other changes to our senior leadership during the past year.  The failure to successfully 
transition and assimilate key employees could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, 
retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.
We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions.
Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our 
ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations.  Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial 
capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other 
strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:
▪our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;
▪failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;
▪disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;
▪failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all 
or without materially burdensome conditions, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, 
or other unforeseen factors;
▪our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and 
restructuring charges;
▪our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired 
businesses;
▪our inability to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and 
technology;Table of Contents
Other Key Information 61
▪controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, 
and our failure to identify compliance issues or liabilities;
▪our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or 
assets; and
▪the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.
Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, 
particularly in the case of a large acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to 
pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of 
entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. 
Where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures 
and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms; 
changes in market conditions or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate; failure to 
receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approvals, litigation, contractual 
terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support by third parties; actions by competitors; adverse effects on our business 
relationships, operating results, or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transactions; and continued financial 
obligations, unanticipated liabilities, or transition costs associated with such transactions . In some cases, we are not able to divest 
investments on acceptable terms or at all .
We invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments.  We make investments in public and 
private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can 
include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and 
illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize 
a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a 
public offering or acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which at times includes 
bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.
There are risks associated with our previously-announced proposed IPO of Mobileye. We announced that we intend to take Mobileye 
public in the US via an IPO of newly issued Mobileye stock, and that we expect to retain majority ownership of Mobileye following the 
completion of the IPO. The IPO may not be completed in our expected timeframe, or at all, due to factors that include adverse changes in 
economic or market conditions or in our business; delays in regulatory, stock exchange, or other approvals; loss of Mobileye key 
employees, and changes in our business strategy. If we do not complete the IPO, our ability to retain and attract Mobileye employees 
could be adversely affected, and we will have incurred expenses that we will be unable to recover, and for which we will not receive any 
benefit. If completed, the IPO may not produce any increase for our stockholders in the market value of their holdings in our company. In 
addition, the market price of our common stock could be more volatile after the IPO.
We are subject to sales-related risks. 
We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.  We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties 
such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We 
depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to 
customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material 
change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our 
ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and 
stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end 
customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many 
risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products that 
compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. 
From time to time, they face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and 
financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could 
have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce 
sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.
From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized "gray market." Gray market products can distort demand 
and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. 
Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes 
include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be 
substandard.
We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers.  Collectively, our three largest customers accounted 
for 43% of our net revenue in 2021  and 39% of our net revenue in 2020 . We expect a small number of customers will continue to account 
for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 62
Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing 
power of certain customers, particularly cloud service providers , in some of our data center-focused businesses.  The cloud and cloud 
applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in 
the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and 
customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and 
applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; 
and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across 
these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including in serving cloud service provider customers, and the 
competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCG in 2021 . 
Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including 
designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service 
levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more 
difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely 
affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to 
migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order 
changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. 
The loss of a key customer, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our 
revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our 
customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see " Note 3: Operating Segments " 
within the Consolidated Financial Statements .
We face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from US federal, state, local, and foreign government 
entities associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected 
by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval 
of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and 
performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US 
government are subject to special rules  on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, and/or employees, 
and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, 
and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.
Changes  in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
A number of factors can increase our effective tax rate, which could reduce our net income, including: 
▪changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;
▪the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;
▪changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;
▪adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;
▪increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;
▪changes in available tax credits;
▪changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;
▪changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the US to the taxation of manufacturing 
enterprises and of non-US income and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD  recommendations 
or other legislative actions;
▪changes in accounting standards; and
▪our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred 
upon repatriation.
We have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. 
We are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases 
fluctuate based on factors that include prioritizing cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational 
spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Our stock repurchase 
program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that repurchases will enhance long-term 
stockholder value. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years. Table of Contents

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchang e Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates 
knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions 
during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 
2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one 
such sanction. From time to time, our local subsidiary is required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in 
order to conduct business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the 
US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly 
associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. We plan to continue these activities as required to conduct business in the Russian 
Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law.
On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security 
firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive 
Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a 
license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such 
activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.Table of Contents

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockh olders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 25, 2021  and 
December 26, 2020 , the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Stockholders' Equity for 
each of the three years  in the period ended December 25, 2021 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company at December 25, 2021  and December 26, 2020 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three 
years  in the period ended December 25, 2021 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021 , based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our 
report dated January 26, 2022  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our 
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or 
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was 
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to 
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical 
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to 
which it relates.Table of Contents

Inventory Valuation
Description of the 
MatterThe Company's net inventory totaled $10.8 billion  as of December 25, 2021 , representing 6.4%  of total assets. 
As explained in " Note 2: Accounting Policies " within the Consolidated Financial Statements , the Company 
computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of 
products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to 
assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the 
products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the 
determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing 
overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost 
or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable 
quality. 
Auditing management's assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the 
determination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is 
judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as 
customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain 
new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.
How We Addressed 
the Matter in Our 
AuditWe evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over the 
costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the calculation of lower of 
cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices, and the 
determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory.
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product 
costs and selling prices, and product demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management's 
inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current 
industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, 
including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory 
valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the 
changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021 , based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the 2021  Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and our report dated January 26, 2022  expressed an unqualified opinion 
thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our 
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2021 , 2020 , and 2019  were 52-week fiscal 
years; 2022  is a 53-week fiscal year . Our Consolidated Financial Statements  include the accounts of Intel and our subsidiaries. We have 
eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period 
presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements  in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that 
affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements  and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience 
may differ materially from our estimates.
Note 2 : Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or 
services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales . In accordance with contract terms, revenue for 
product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the 
agreed upon shipping terms. 
We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable 
consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists 
primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer 
based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable 
balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued 
liabilities .
We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products . We 
generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct 
service, which we record as expense when the marketing activities occur.
Inventories
We compute  inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive 
engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities 
and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales , and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. 
For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous 
technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to 
manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million  in the 
quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the 
period incurred.
The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal 
capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in 
a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion 
of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in 
that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges are insignificant in the years presented. 
Charges in years prior to those presented have ranged up to $1.1 billion  taken in connection with the 2009 economic recession .
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of 
the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net 
realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies , with costs improving over time due to scale and 
improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing 
environment.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 77
The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable  quality. 
We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build 
decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate 
of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. 
When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we 
write off amounts considered to be excess inventory.  
Property, Plant  and Equipment
We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings 
related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that 
asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.
We evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors 
such as the process technology cadence between node transitions , changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of 
machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory 
planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, 
primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of 
assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.
Assets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding 
when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, 
significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an 
asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be 
impaired. 
Fair Value
When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions 
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative , equity method investments, and grants 
receivable . We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying 
instrument type.
The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: 
▪Level 1 . Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining 
whether a market is active.
▪Level 2.  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active 
markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or 
can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable  market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
We use  LIBOR -based  yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves , currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant 
inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted 
for security-specific restrictions . When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices 
for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally  developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.
▪Level 3.  Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or 
liabilities.  We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are 
reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus 
prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.
Debt Investments
We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash 
equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and 
reverse repurchase agreements.
Marketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a 
related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk 
from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising 
from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains 
on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 78
Marketable debt investments are considered available-for-sale investments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not 
hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. Available-for-sale debt 
investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash 
equivalents. Available-for-sale debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months 
and remaining maturities of  less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments with 
remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments are reported at 
fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost 
of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level, and record the interest income and realized gains or 
losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.
Our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews . For investments in an unrealized loss position, we 
determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and 
reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the 
unrealized  loss when appropriate,  and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required 
or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for  credit losses and write-downs are 
recognized in interest and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income 
(loss).
Equity Investments
We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments 
are measured and recorded as follows: 
▪Marketable equity secu rities  are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with 
changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement. 
▪Non-marketable equity securities  are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement 
alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable 
price changes.
▪Equity method investments  are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise 
significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity 
method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments  is recognized on a 
one-quarter lag.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains 
(losses) on equity investments, net.  The carrying value  of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price 
changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an 
observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.  
Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes 
requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of 
estimates. 
Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also 
subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may 
have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee's financial condition and business 
outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events 
and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-
marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including 
discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. 
▪Non-marketable equity securities  are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long-
lived assets. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value 
and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
▪Equity method investments  are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which 
considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient 
period of time to allow for recovery. 
Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 79
Derivative Financial Instruments
Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a 
lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk . We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in 
derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty.  We also enter into collateral security 
arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments 
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds . For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value 
amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related 
collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other 
accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.
Cash flow hedges  use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for 
variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital 
purchases spending.
The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects 
earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign 
currency contracts hed ging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are 
recognized in earnings in  the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item . If the cash flow 
hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would 
be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in 
the same section as the underlying item.
Fair value hedges  use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our 
fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the 
offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are 
recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities.
Non-designated hedges  use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized 
monetary assets and liabilities, non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and non-US-dollar-denominated 
loans receivable  recognized at fair value. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollar-
denominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as trading assets. The change in fair value of these derivatives  is recorded through 
earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and 
other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the 
changes in the fair value of the related derivatives.  
Loans Receivable
We elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the 
loan with a related derivative instrument. When the fair value option is not elected, the loans are carried at amortized cost . We measure 
interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated 
coupon rate. We classify our loans within other current and long-term assets.  
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, 
derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements,  and trade receivables. We generally place investments 
with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our 
analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing . As required per our investment policy, substantially all  of our investments in debt 
instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. 
We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions 
with the same counterparty.  Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are 
generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of 
December 25, 2021 , our total credit exposure to any single counterparty , excluding money market funds invested in US treasury and US 
agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not excee d $2.6 billion . To 
further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure 
collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions  when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral 
exchanged under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued 
liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the 
collateral as an asset or a liability  unless the collateral is repledged.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 80
A substantial majority  of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs . We also have accounts receivable derived 
from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the 
net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers ( 42% as of December 25, 2021 ) do not represent a significant credit 
risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. 
We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are 
moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this 
analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, 
such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.
Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their 
estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in 
determining the fair value of the following:
▪inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration, each as may be 
applicable; 
▪intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, 
and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;
▪deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the 
acquisition date; and
▪goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired 
and the liabilities assumed.
Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the 
management of the acquired companies. We allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the 
business combination.
Goodwill
We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently 
if indicators of potential impairment exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an 
impairment. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, 
excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. 
Qualitative  factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors 
affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative 
factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.
Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. 
Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, operating 
expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital.
We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In the current 
year, the fair value for all of our reporting units substantially exceeds  their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not 
indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary.  
Identified Intangible Assets
We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life. Acquisition-related in-
process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of 
acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, 
the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to amortization from 
that point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.
We perform a quarterly review of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as 
industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines.  
Employee Equity Incentive Plans
We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net 
of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we 
eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if 
each vesting period were a separate award.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 81
For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum 
statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to 
pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is 
based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.
Income Taxes
We compute  the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets 
and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently 
enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. 
We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for 
taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe 
that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our 
deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such 
changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that 
the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such 
positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred 
income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for 
outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. 
Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and 
investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment 
needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable 
non-US income and withholding taxes.  
Leases
Leases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably 
certain that we will exercise that option. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and the non-lease 
components are accounted for separately and not included in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be 
fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.
Loss Contingencies
We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related 
to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects , as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that 
arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable 
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  We evaluate developments that could affect the 
amount of liability that has been previously accrued and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. 
Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters .
Note 3 : Operating Segments
We manage our business through the following operating segments :
▪CCG
▪DCG
▪IOTG
▪Mobileye
▪NSG
▪PSG
We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class of 
product. We offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a 
stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, based on Intel architecture . Platform products are used in various form factors across our CCG, 
DCG, and IOTG  operating segments. Our non-platform, or adjacent, product s can be combined with platform products to form 
comprehensive platform solutions to meet customer needs.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 82
CCG and DCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, Mobileye, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify 
as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our 
Internet of Things portfolio, presented as Internet of Things, is comprised of the IOTG and Mobileye operating segments. For 2021, the 
results of our Intel Optane memory business are included in our DCG operating segment, and our NSG segment is comprised of our 
NAND memory business to align to the pending  divestiture of our NAND  memory business. Refer to " Note 10 : Acquisitions and 
Divestitures " within Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements  for further information on the d ivestiture . 
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally 
allocated to the operating segments.
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
▪results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented;  
▪historical results of operations from divested businesses;  
▪results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;  
▪amounts included within restructuring and other charges;  
▪a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and  
▪acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.  
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about 
the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset 
information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing 
and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is 
included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. 
Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense 
included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment 
revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. 
Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other 
segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a who le.Table of Contents

In 2021 , our three largest customers accounted fo r 43% of our net revenue ( 39% in 2020  and 41% in 2019 ), with Dell Inc. accounting 
for 21% (17% in 2020  and 17% in 2019 ), Lenovo Group Limited accounting for 12% (12% in 2020  and 13% in 2019 ), and HP Inc. 
accounting for 10% (10% in 2020  and 11% in 2019 ). These three customers accounted for 42% of our accounts receivable as 
of December 25, 2021  (43% as of December 26, 2020 ). Substantially all  of the revenue from these customers was from the sale of 
platforms and other components by the CCG and DCG operating segments.

We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock 
outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock 
from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock 
options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP.  In January 2020, 
we fully redeemed the  remaining principal of our 2009 Debentures. We included our 2009 Debentures in the calculation of diluted 
earnings per share of common stock in 2019 by applying the treasury stock method because the average market price was above the 
conversion price.
Securities that would have been anti-dilutive are insignificant  and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all 
periods presented.
Note 5 : Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities consist of prepayments  received on long-term prepaid customer supply agreements  toward future product delivery and

Effective tax rate  8.5 %  16.7 %  12.5 %
Our effective tax rate decreased  in 2021  compared to 2020 , primarily driven by one-time tax benefits due to the restructuring of certain 
non-US subsidiaries as well as a higher proportion of our income in non-US jurisdictions. As a result of the restructuring, we established 
deferred tax assets and released the valuation allowances of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets 
established in 2021 fully offset the deferred  tax liabilities recognized in 2020 driven by  a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion 
with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of the planned divestiture of our NAND memory business.
Our effective tax rate increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with 
respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of the planned divestiture of our NAND memory business. It also increased due to 
the reduction in our foreign derived intangible income benefit in 2020.
We derive the effective tax rate benefit attributed to non-US income taxed at different rates primarily from our operations in Hong Kong, 
Ireland, Israel, and Malaysia. The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5%  to 24.0% . We are subject to reduced tax rates 
in Israel and Malaysia as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and make certain capital investments. We have conditional reduced 
tax rates that expire at various dates through 2056  and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration.Table of Contents

Deferred and Current Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.  Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at 
the end of each period  were as follows:

Deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets .
The valuation allowance as of December 25, 2021  included allowances primarily related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $2.0 
billion .
As of December 25, 2021 , our federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $644 million  and $1.1 
billion , respectively. Most  of the non-US net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-US and US federal 
net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2040 . A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the 
US relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year.  The federal and non-US net 
operating loss carryforwards include $357 million  and $860 million , respectively, that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced 
by a valuation allowance.
At December 25, 2021 , we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $18.9 billion  that we have 
indefinitely invested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable 
because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.Table of Contents

Current income taxes receivable of $23 million  as of December 25, 2021  ($131 million  as of December 26, 2020 ) are included in other 
current assets. Current income taxes payable of $1.1 billion  as of December 25, 2021  ($756 million  as of December 26, 2020 ) are 
included in other accrued liabilities.
Long-term income taxes payable of $4.3 billion  as of December 25, 2021  ($4.6 billion  as of December 26, 2020 ) is primarily comprised of 
the transition tax from Tax Reform, which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018, as well as amounts for uncertain tax positions, 
reduced by the associated deduction for state taxes and non-US tax credits.

If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $721 million  as 
of December 25, 2021  ($550 million  as of December 26, 2020 ) and a reduction in the effective tax rate . Interest, penalties, and accrued 
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.
We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we 
conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain 
US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our 
gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021  could decrease by as much as 
$327 million  in the next 12 months. 
We file federal, state, and non-U S tax returns. Excluding pre-acquisition Altera tax years, we are no longer subject to US federal and non-
US tax examinations for years prior to 2013 . For U S state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2014 .

McAfee  Corp.
McAfee completed its initial public offering in October 2020 . Due to our 41% ownership  and significant influence as of December 25,

December 26, 2020 . During 2021 , we recognized McAfee dividends of $1.3 billion , which includes a special dividend of $1.1 billion  paid in 
connection with the sale of McAfee's Enterprise Business to Symphony Technology Group and $228 million  related to the partial sale of 
our investment in McAfee . We reco gnized McAfee dividends of  $126 million  in 2020   and $632 million  in 2019 .
In November 2021 , McAfee announced an agreement to be acquired by an investor group, which is subject to closing conditions.
Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd.

Acquisitions
We completed four acquisitions in 2021  and six acquisitions in 2020 , all of which qualified as business combinations. The consideration 
for the acquisitions in 2021  and 2020  primarily consisted of cash and was allocated to goodwill and identified intangible assets. For 
information  on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments, see " Note 11: Goodwill ," and for information on the classification of 
intangible assets, see " Note 12: Identified Intangible Assets ."Table of Contents

Moovit
On May 4, 2020, we acquired Moovit, a MaaS  solutions company, for total consideration of $915 million . The fair values of the assets 
acquired relate to goodwill of $638 million  and intangible assets of $331 million . The goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributed to 
the expected synergies and other benefits that will be generated from the combination of Intel and Moovit. Substantially all  of the goodwill 
will not be deductible for local tax purposes. The acquisition-related intangible assets are primarily related to Moovit's monthly active user 
base and application platform. The goodwill and operating results of Moovit are included in our Mobileye operating segment.
Divest itures
NAND  Memory Business
In October 2020, we signed an agreement  with SK hynix  Inc. (SK  hynix) to divest our NAND memory business  for $9.0 billion  in cash. The 
NAND memory business includes our NAND memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China and certain related equipment and tangible 
assets (the Fab Assets ), our NAND SSD business (the NAND SSD Business), and our NAND memory technology and manufacturing 
business ( the NAND OpCo Business ). The transaction will be completed in two closings. 
The first closing was completed on  December 29, 2021 , subsequent to our fiscal 2021  year-end. At first closing,  SK hynix  paid $7.0 billion  
of consideration, with the remaining $2.0 billion  to be received at the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than 
March 2025 . In connection with the first closing, we expect to recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 billion  within interest and 
other, net, and tax expense of approximately $450 million . Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and 
sale agreement, approximately $600 million  of the initial closing consideration will be deferred and recognized between first and second 
closing within interest and other, ne t.
At the first closing, we sold to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business and transferred certain employees, IP, and other 
assets related to the NAND OpCo Business to separately created wholly owned subsidiaries of Intel. The equity interest of the NAND 
OpCo Business will transfer to SK hynix at the second closing.  In connection with the first clos ing, we and certain affiliates of SK hynix 
also entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND 
memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, C hina until the second closing . We have concluded based on the 
terms of the transaction agreements that the subsidiaries will be variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary, 
because the governance structure of these entities does not allow us to direct the activities that would most significantly impact their 
economic performance. In line with this conclusion, we will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the 
first quarter of 2022, and will record a receivable for the second closing proceeds of $1.9 billion . 
The carrying amounts of the major classes of NAND assets held for sale included the following:

agreement provided for continued capital purchases through first closing and we invested $1.6 billion  in 2021 , which is classified as 
assets held for sale at period end  and sold at first closing. 
Home Gateway Platform Division
On July 31, 2020, we completed the divestiture of the majority of Home Gateway Platform, a division of CCG, for proceeds of $150 
million . The divestiture included the transfer of certain employees, equipment, and an ongoing  supply agreement for future units.
Smartphone Modem Business
On December 2, 2019, we completed the divestiture of the majority of our smartphone modem business, including certain employees, IP, 
equipment, and leases. Net assets sold were $267 million . We recognized a pre-tax gain of $690 million  on the divestiture . Table of Contents

1To manage foreign currency risk associated with the Australian-dollar-denominated notes issued in 2015, we entered into currency interest rate 
swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $396 million  at December 25, 2021 , which effectively converted these notes to US-dollar-denominated 
notes. For further discussion o n derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships,  see " Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments ." Principal and

Senior Notes
In 2021 , we issued a total of $5.0 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Net proceeds from the offerings  are being used for 
general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing outstanding debt, funding for working capital, and capital expenditures . During 
2021 , we repaid  $500 million  of our 1.70%  senior notes that matured in May 2021 and $2.0 billion  of our 3.30%  senior notes that matured 
in October 2021. 
In 2020 , we issued a total of $10.3 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes and repaid $1.0 billion  of our 1.85%  senior notes that 
matured in May 2020 and $1.8 billion  of our 2.45%  senior notes that matured in July 2020. We also repaid $700 million  in floating-rate 
senior notes that matured in May 2020. 
Our floating-rate senior note  pays interest quarterly and our fixed-rate senior notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed-
rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the 
notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank 
junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
Revolving Credit Facility
In 2021, we entered into a $5.0 billion  variable-rate revolving credit facility  that, if drawn, is expected to be used for general corporate 
purposes. The revolving credit facility matures in March 2026 and had no borrowings outstanding as of December 25, 2021 .
Convertible Debentures
In 2009, we issued the 2009 Debentures, which were convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock and paid 
a fixed rate of interest semiannually . In 2020 , we paid $1.1 billion  in cash to settle  our remaining $372 million  in principal, resulting in a 
loss of $109 million  in interest and other, net and $750 million  as a reduction in stockholders' equity related to the conversion feature.

Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current 
period. If an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we 
classify these assets as Level 3. 
We classify non-marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity method investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on 
these investments held as of December 25, 2021  were $138 million  ($266 million  on investments held as of December 26, 2020  and $113 
million  on investments held as of December 28, 2019 ).
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method 
investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, and issued  debt . 
We classify the fair value of grants receivable  as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their 
carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 25, 2021  was $317 million  (the aggregate carrying 
value of grants receivable as of December 26, 2020  was $139 million ).
We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding commercial paper and drafts payable) as Level 2. The fair value of these instruments 
was $41.5 billion  as of December 25, 2021  ($40.9 billion  as of December 26, 2020 ).

variable, receive-fixed interest rate  swaps  was $12.0 billion  as of December 25, 2021  and $12.0 billion  as of December 26, 2020 . In 2019, 
we unwound $7.1 billion  of these swaps, resulting in a $111 million  gain to be amortized over the remaining life of the debt.

Note 17 : Retirement Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Plan s
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the US and 
certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred 
basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan 
for certain highly compensated employees. 
We expensed  $444 million  in 2021  and $398 million  in 2020  for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions 
under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Prior to 2020, the contributions were 
discretionary and we expensed $379 million  in 2019 .
US Retiree Medical Plan
Upon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree Medical Plan. 
The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.
As of December 25, 2021  and December 26, 2020 , the projected benefit obligation was $682 million  and $741 million , which used the 
discount rate of 2.8%  and 2.4% . The December 25, 2021  and December 26, 2020  corresponding fair value of plan assets was $669 
million  and $600 million .
The investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future 
benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively 
managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. 
The t ax-aware fixed-income long credit portfo lio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with 
market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges,  which are  65% 
equity and  35% fixed income investments. As of December 25, 2021 , the majority  of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in 
exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs.  The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets 
were invested in fixed income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.
The estimated benefit payments  for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:

Postretirement Medical Benefits $ 37 $ 38 $ 39 $ 41 $ 42 $ 219 
Pension Benefit Plans
We provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly Ireland, the US, Israel, and Germany. The  majority  of the 
plans' benefits have been frozen. 
Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit Plans
The vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee 
is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement .Table of Contents

4All plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan asset s for all periods presented.  
Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the 
corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger 
of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis .

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  2.7 %  3.3 %  4.7 %
Rate of compensation increase  3.2 %  3.2 %  3.5 %
We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity 
with the average duration of the pension liabilities. 
We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund 
asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate 
of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for 
each asset class.Table of Contents

Funding
Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and 
regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the US Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under 
applicable laws and regulations; additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate.
On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 68% funded as of December 25, 2021 . The US Pension Plan, which 
accounts for 28% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations , was 99% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our 
ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for US retirement plans is 
determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions . Cumulative company funding to the US Pension Plan 
currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost
The net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was $162 million  in 2021  ($164 million  in 2020  and $135 million  
in 2019 ).

US Plan Assets
The investment strategy for US Pension Plan assets is to manage the funded status volatility, taking into consideration the investment 
horizon and expected volatility to help ensure that sufficient assets are available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation 
to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when 
outside the target ranges, which are 90% fixed income and 10% equity investments. During 2021 , the US Pension Plan assets were 
invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value. 
Non-US Plan Assets
The investments of the non-US plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with 
regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within 
the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard 
contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to 
set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through 
index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, 
asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help ensure  that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as 
they come due. The target allocation of the non-US plan assets that we have control over was approximately 45% fixed income, 35% 
equity, and 20% hedge fund investments in 2021 .
The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the US, 
and emerging markets throughout the world.
We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority  of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in 
hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity index funds.

Note 18 : Employee Equity Incentive Plans
Our equity incentive plan s are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder 
and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP .
Under the 2006 Plan, 866 million  shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-
employee directors through June 2023. As of December 25, 2021 , 128 million  shares of common stock remained available for future 
grants.
Under the 2006 Plan, we grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, 
performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees . For 
PSUs granted in 2021 , the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200%  of the target 
grant amount, equally based on two metrics: our three-year cumulative non-GAAP EPS growth relative to a target rate and TSR of our 
common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of the S&P 500 IT Sector Index over a three -year period. TSR is a measure of 
stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period . As of December 25, 2021 , 15 million PSUs  were outstanding. 
PSUs vest three years from the grant date. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over  four years  from the grant date.  
Stock options generally expire 10 years  from the date of grant. 
Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation recognized in 2021  was $2.0 billion  ($1.9 billion  in 2020  and $1.7 billion  in 2019 ). During 2021 , the tax benefit 
that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $377 million  ($380 million  in 2020  and $359 million  in 2019 ).
We estimate the fair value of RSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of 
grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting . We estimate the fair 
value of RSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility.  
Restricted Stock Units
Weighted average assumptions used in estimating grant values were as follows:
Dec 25, 2021 Dec 26, 2020 Dec 28, 2019
Estimated values $ 50.82 $ 54.82 $ 48.06 
Risk-free interest rate  0.2 %  0.4 %  2.3 %

December 25, 2021  118.0 $ 51.29 
Expected to vest  105.9 $ 51.47 
The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2021  was $1.7 billion  ($1.9 billion  in 2020  and $1.9 billion  in 2019 ), which represents the 
market value of our common stock on the  date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2021  was $1.4 
billion  ($1.3 billion  in 2020  and $1.3 billion  in 2019 ). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on 
behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated 
future forfeitures.
As of December 25, 2021 , unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $3.8 billion . 
We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of  1.5 years.
Stock Purchase Plan
The 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific 
dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million  shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 25, 
2021 , 227 million  shares of common stock remained available for issuance.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 104
Employees purchased 22 million  shares of common stock in 2021  for $925 million  under the 2006 ESPP ( 21 million  shares of common 
stock for $876 million  in 2020  and 17 million  shares of common stock for $688 million  in 2019 ). As of December 25, 2021 , unrecognized 
share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled  $48 million . We 
expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months .
Note 19 : Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
We recognized operating leased assets in other long-term assets of $549 million  and corresponding accrued liabilities of $180 million , and 
other long-term liabilities of $295 million  as of December 25, 2021 . Our operating leases have remaining terms of 1 to 14 years  and may 
include options to extend the leases for up to 37 years . The weighted average remaining lease term was 3.8 years , and the weighted 
average discount rate was 2.5%  as of December 25, 2021  for our operating leases. 
Operating lease expense was $798 million  in 2021  ($416 million  in 2020  and $185 million  in 2019 ), including $620 million  in variable lease 
expense in 2021 . 
In 2021, we signed finance leases for supplier capacity extending over approximately eight years.  The leases will commence upon start of 
supplier production expected in 2023 with prepayments totaling approximately $980 million  in 2022 and 2023. These prepayments will be 
recognized in property, plant and equipment upon payment.
Discounted and undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of December 25, 2021 , excluding non-lease components, 
were as follows:

Commitments
Commitments for capital expenditures  totaled $27.0 billion  as of December 25, 2021  ($8.6 billion  as of December 26, 2020 ), a substantial 
majority  of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $12.4 billion  
as of December 25, 2021  (approximately $2.6 billion  as of December 26, 2020 ). Other purchase obligations and commitments include 
payments due under supply agreements and various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. Contractual 
obligations for purchases of goods or services relate to agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant 
terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. 
For obligations with cancellation provisions, amounts are limited to the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee under the 
agreement.  
Legal Proceedings
We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. In the first quarter 
of 2021, we accrued a charge of $2.2 billion related to litigation involving VLSI, described below. Excluding this charge, management at 
present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially  harm our financial 
position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject 
to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include 
substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate 
monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could 
include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular 
business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results 
of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests 
of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically 
described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. Table of Contents

European Commissio n Competition Matter
In 2001, the EC commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business 
practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the 
EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that 
Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision 
finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC 
found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" 
that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by 
making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival products." The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion  ($1.4 billion  as 
of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately bring to an end the 
infringement referred to in" the EC decision.
The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated 
that we should "cease and desist" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are 
subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the 
decision and to explain changes to our business practices.
We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our 
appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with 
the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of 
Intel's grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a 
rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the 
Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision 
in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether 
the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court appointed a panel of five judges to consider our appeal of 
the EC's 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice's clarifications of the law. In November 2017, the parties filed initial "Observations" 
about the Court of Justice's decision and the appeal and were invited by the General Court to offer supplemental comments to each 
other's "Observations," which the parties submitted in March 2018. Responses to other questions posed by the General Court were filed 
in May and June 2018. The General Court heard oral argument in March 2020, and on January 26, 2022 issued a decision annulling the 
EC’s finding against Intel regarding rebates as well as the fine on Intel. Any appeal of the General Court’s decision must be brought before 
the Court of Justice by early April 2022.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly 
referred to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown") that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings 
like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate 
software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly 
reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. 
Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our current and former executives and directors, in US federal and 
state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, as well as other variants 
of these vulnerabilities that have since been identified.
As of  January 25, 2022 , consumer class action lawsuits relating to the above class of security vulnerabilities publicly disclosed since 2018 
were pending in the United States, Canada, and Israel. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our 
products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and 
assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, numerous 
individual class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated in April 2018 for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court 
for the District of Oregon. In March 2020, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the complaint in that consolidated action but granted 
plaintiffs leave to amend. In March 2021, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the amended complaint but granted plaintiffs leave to 
further amend in part. Plaintiffs filed a further amended complaint in May 2021, which Intel moved to dismiss in July 2021 . In Canada, in 
one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled. In a second case 
pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec,  a stay of the case was in effect until December  2021, and the parties' joint request for 
a further stay to May 2022 is pending with the court . In Israel, two consumer class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Haifa. 
The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the first lawsuit in July 2021. Intel filed a motion to stay the second case pending resolution of the 
consolidated proceeding in the US, and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for April 2022.  Additional lawsuits and claims may 
be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend 
those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the 
early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified 
or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved,  we are unable 
to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 106
In addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders filed multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits since January 2018 against certain current 
and former members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former officers, alleging that the defendants breached their duties 
to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. 
The complaints sought to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. Some of the derivative actions were filed in the US 
District Court for the Northern District of California and were consolidated, and the others were filed in the Superior Court of the State of 
California in San Mateo County and were consolidated. The federal court granted defendants' motion to dismiss in August 2018 on the 
ground that plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to show they were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. The 
federal court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, but subsequently dismissed the cases in January 2019 at plaintiffs' request. 
The California Superior Court entered judgment in defendants' favor in August 2020 after granting defendants' motions to dismiss 
plaintiffs' consolidated complaint and three successive amended complaints, all for failure to plead facts sufficient to show plaintiffs were 
excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the California court's judgment in October 
2020. In January 2021, another Intel stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court in San Mateo County against certain 
current and former officers and members of our Board of Directors. The lawsuit asserts claims similar to those dismissed in August 2020, 
except that it alleges that the stockholder made a pre-lawsuit demand on our Board of Directors and that the demand was wrongfully 
refused. In May 2021, the court granted defendants' motion to stay the action pending the outcome of any litigation plaintiff may choose to 
file in Delaware where Intel's bylaws require such claims to be filed.
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Starting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California 
against Intel and certain current and former officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who 
purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July 2020, generally allege that the defendants violated 
securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced delays. 
In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a 
consolidated complaint. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above 
and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending 
proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or 
classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be  
resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. 
In July 2021, Intel introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now Intel 4.
Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain 
of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial 
fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, 
or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could 
result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to 
indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require 
that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse 
ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as 
a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.
Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences v. Intel China, Ltd., et al.
In February 2018, the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS) sued Intel China, Ltd., Dell China, Ltd. 
(Dell), and Beijing Jingdong Century Information Technology, Ltd. (JD) for patent infringement in the Beijing Higher People's Court. 
IMECAS alleges that Intel's Core series processors  infringe Chinese patent CN 102956457 ('457 Patent). The complaint demands an 
injunction and damages of at least RMB 200 million  plus the cost of litigation. Intel is indemnifying Dell and JD. The Beijing Higher 
People's Court held a final trial hearing in September 2021. No ruling has been issued. In March 2018, Intel filed an invalidation request 
on the '457 patent with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). The CNIPA held an oral hearing in September 
2018 and in February 2019 upheld the validity of the challenged claims . Intel filed a complaint in April 2019 with the Beijing Intellectual 
Property (IP) Court challenging the February 2019 CNIPA ruling. The Beijing IP Court held oral arguments in July and October 2021 and 
in November 2021 affirmed the CNIPA ruling. In December 2021, Intel filed an appeal with the Supreme People's Court challenging the 
Beijing IP Court's affirmance of the CNIPA ruling. In January 2020, Intel filed a second invalidation request on the '457 patent with the 
CNIPA, for which the CNIPA heard oral argument in July 2020 and in November 2020 held the challenged apparatus claims invalid. 
IMECAS filed a complaint in February 2021 with the Beijing IP Court challenging the November 2020 CNIPA ruling. In December 2020, 
Intel filed a third invalidation request on the  '457 patent with the CNIPA. The CNIPA held an oral hearing in June 2021 and in September 
2021 upheld the validity of the challenged claims. Intel filed a complaint in December 2021 with the Beijing IP Court challenging the 
September 2021 CNIPA ruling. In September 2018 and March 2019, Intel filed petitions with the US Patent and Trademark Office 
(USPTO) requesting institution of inter partes  review (IPR) of US Patent No. 9,070,719, the US counterpart to the '457 patent. The 
USPTO denied institution  of Intel's petitions in March and October 2019, respectively. In April 2019, Intel filed a request for rehearing and 
a petition for a Precedential Opinion Panel (POP) in the USPTO to challenge the denial of its first IPR petition, and in November 2019 
Intel filed a request for rehearing on the second IPR petition. In January 2020, the USPTO denied the POP petition on the first IPR 
petition. In June 2020, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) denied Intel's rehearing requests on both petitions.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 107
In October 2019, IMECAS filed second and third lawsuits in the Beijing IP Court, alleging infringement of Chinese Patent No. CN 
102386226 ('226 Patent) based on the manufacturing and sale of Intel® Core  i3 microprocessors . Defendants in the second case are 
Lenovo (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (Lenovo) and Beijing Jiayun Huitong Technology Development Co. Ltd. (BJHT). Defendants in the third case 
are Intel Corp., Intel China Co., Ltd., the Intel China Beijing Branch, Beijing Digital China Co., Ltd. (Digital China), and JD. The complaint 
in the second lawsuit demands an injunction plus litigation costs and reserves the right to claim damages in unspecified amounts. Intel is 
indemnifying Lenovo in the second lawsuit. The Beijing IP Court held a trial hearing in the second lawsuit in November 2021, but no ruling 
has been issued. The complaint in the third lawsuit demands an injunction plus litigation costs and claims damages of RMB 10 million. 
Intel China's jurisdictional challenge in the third lawsuit was denied  in June 2021 by the Beijing IP Court and in November 2021 by the 
Supreme People's Court. A trial hearing in the third lawsuit was held in January 2022 , but no ruling has been issued. In July 2020, Intel 
and Lenovo filed invalidation requests on the '226 patent with the CNIPA. The CNIPA heard oral arguments in December 2020, during 
which IMECAS proposed amendments to two claims. In April 2021, the CNIPA upheld the validity of the challenged and amended claims 
on both invalidation request s. Intel and Lenovo filed complaints in July 2021 with the Beijing IP Court challenging the April 2021 CNIPA 
rulings; the Beijing IP Court held oral arguments in October 2021.
Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, the unspecified nature and extent of damages claimed by IMECAS, and 
uncertainty regarding the availability of injunctive relief under applicable law, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential 
loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. We dispute IMECAS's claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel  
In October 2017, VLSI filed a complaint against Intel in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging infringement of 
eight patents acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). The patents, which originated at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. and NXP 
B.V., are US Patent Nos. 7,268,588; 7,675,806; 7,706,207; 7,709,303; 8,004,922; 8,020,014; 8,268,672; and 8,566,836. VLSI accuses 
various FPGA and processor products of infringement. VLSI estimated its damages to be at least $5.5 billion, and its complaint further 
sought enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. In May, June, September, and October 2018, Intel filed 
IPR petitions challenging the patentability of certain claims in all eight of the patents in-suit. The PTAB instituted review of six patents and 
denied institution on two patents. As a result of the institution decisions, the parties stipulated to stay the District Court action in March 
2019. In December 2019 and February 2020, the PTAB found all claims of the '588 and '303 patents, and some claims of the '922 patent, 
to be unpatentable. The PTAB found the challenged claims of the '014, '672 and '207 patents to be patentable. Intel appealed the PTAB’s 
decision as to ‘014, ‘672 and ‘207 patents. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB’s decision as to the ‘672 and ‘207 patents, but reversed 
and remanded as to the ‘014 patent. Intel moved for a continuation of the stay in March 2020 pending the appeal. In June 2020, the 
District Court issued an order continuing the stay through August 2021. The court lifted the stay in September 2021 and scheduled a trial 
for March 2024. 
In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement by various Intel 
processors  of five additional patents acquired from NXP: US Patent Nos. 6,212,663; 7,246,027; 7,247,552; 7,523,331; and 8,081,026. 
VLSI accused Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys' 
fees and costs, and interest. In March 2019, the District Court dismissed VLSI's claims for willful infringement as to all the patents-in-suit 
except the '027 patent, and also dismissed VLSI's allegations of indirect infringement as to the '633, '331, and '026 patents. In June 2019, 
Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of certain claims in all five patents-in-suit . In January 2020, VLSI said that it was no 
longer asserting any claims of the '633 patent. In January and February 2020, the PTAB instituted review of the '552, '633, '331 and '026 
patents, but declined to institute review of the '027 patent. As a result, the District Court stayed the case as to the '026 and '552 patents 
but allowed the case to proceed on the '027 and '331 patents. In January 2021, the PTAB invalidated certain asserted claims of the '026 
patent, and in February the PTAB invalidated all asserted claims of the '552 patent. Both parties filed notices of appeal regarding the 
PTAB's decision as to the '026 patent in March 2021, and in April 2021, VLSI filed a notice of appeal of the PTAB's decision as to the '552 
patent. The case remains stayed as to both of those patents. For the '027 and '331 patents, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately 
$4.13  billion plus  enhanced damages for the '027 patent. Intel is  filing summary judgment motions and challenges to expert witnesses in 
accordance with the court's January 2022 deadline. 
In March 2019, VLSI filed a third suit against Intel, also in US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of six more 
patents acquired from NXP: US Patent Nos. 6,366,522; 6,663,187; 7,292,485; 7,606,983; 7,725,759; and 7,793,025. In April 2019, VLSI 
voluntarily dismissed this Delaware case without prejudice. In April 2019, VLSI filed three new infringement suits against Intel in the US 
District Court for the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of infringement. The three suits collectively 
assert the same six patents from the voluntarily dismissed Delaware case plus two additional patents acquired from NXP, US Patent Nos. 
7,523,373 and 8,156,357. VLSI accuses Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, 
enhanced damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and interest. In the first Texas case, VLSI asserted the '373 and '759 patents (in December 
2020, the court granted Intel summary judgment of non-infringement on the '357 patent, which had also been asserted  in the first Texas 
case). That case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded a “lump sum” to VLSI of $1.5 billion for literal infringement of the 
‘373 patent and $675 million for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of the ‘759 patent. The jury found that Intel had not willfully 
infringed either patent. Intel has challenged the verdict with post-trial motions, including filing in May 2021 a motion for a new trial and a 
motion for judgment as a matter of law that the ‘373 and ‘759 patents are not infringed and the ‘759 patent is invalid. The court denied the 
motion for new trial in August 2021, but other post-trial motions, including the motion for judgment as a matter of law, remain pending. If 
the court does not vacate the verdict, Intel will challenge it on appeal. 
The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that Intel does  not infringe the ‘522 and ‘187 patents. VLSI had 
sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement of those patents, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has 
not yet entered a judgment following the first or second trials in Texas. Table of Contents

The third Texas case has been postponed and is not currently set for trial. In that case, VLSI seeks approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 
billion for alleged infringement of the ‘983, ‘025 and ‘485 patents, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. In October and 
November 2019 and in February 2020, Intel filed IPR petitions on certain asserted claims across six of the patents-in-suit  in WDTX. 
Between May and October 2020, the PTAB denied all of these petitions on a discretionary basis and without reviewing the merits. Intel 
requested a rehearing, as well as review from the POP, as to all petitions. All requests for POP review and rehearing were denied. Intel 
filed notices of appeal regarding the discretionary denials for all petitions in February and March of 2021. The Federal Circuit dismissed 
the appeals in May 2021 for lack of jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit denied Intel's petition for hearing en banc in August 2021. In 
December 2021, Intel petitioned the Supreme Court to hear its appeal as to whether the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to review the 
PTAB’s discretionary denials of Intel’s IPRs.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) 
Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201410094015.9, accusing certain Intel Core processors of 
infringement. VLSI requests an injunction as well as RMB 1 million  in damages and RMB 300 thousand in expenses. Defendants filed an 
invalidation petition in October 2019 with the CNIPA, which held a hearing in September 2021. In May 2020, defendants filed a motion to 
stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court held the first evidentiary hearing in November 2020 and 
the second in July 2021. The court also held trial proceedings in the hearing in July 2021 and concluded that further trial proceedings 
were needed but indicated those would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants’ invalidity challenge at the CNIPA. In July 2021, 
VLSI dismissed its case, but refiled it in August 2021. In November 2021, Intel moved for a stay of the August 2021 action pending a ruling 
on invalidity. The court has not yet ruled on that motion.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a second case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) 
Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201080024173.7. VLSI accuses certain Intel Core 
processors and seeks an injunction, as well as RMB 1 million in damages and RMB 300 thousand in expenses. Defendants filed with the 
CNIPA an invalidation petition in October 2019 and the CNIPA held a hearing in September 2021, but has not yet issued a decision. In 
June 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court held its first 
evidentiary hearing in September 2020. The court held a second evidentiary hearing in December 2020, and a trial the same month. At 
trial, VLSI dropped its monetary damages claim, but still requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. The court has not 
yet issued a decision following the trial. Rather, the court stayed the case in December 2020 pending a determination on invalidity by the 
CNIPA.
In November 2019, Intel, along with Apple Inc., filed a complaint against Fortress Investment Group LLC, Fortress Credit Co. LLC, Uniloc 
2017 LLC, Uniloc USA, Inc., Uniloc Luxembourg S.A.R.L., VLSI, INVT SPE LLC, Inventergy Global, Inc., DSS Technology Management, 
Inc., IXI IP, LLC, and Seven Networks, LLC. Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act by certain defendants, Section 7 of 
the Clayton Act by certain defendants, and California Business and Professions Code section 17200 by all defendants based on 
defendants' unlawful aggregation of patents. In 2020 and 2021, the court twice dismissed plaintiffs' complaint with leave to amend. In 
December 2020, the court granted a joint motion by Apple and Seven Networks to dismiss with prejudice Apple’s claims against Seven 
Networks. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in March 2021. Defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in 
May 2021. Apple withdrew from the case and dismissed its claims in June 2021. The court heard defendants’ motion to dismiss the 
Second Amended Complaint in September 2021, and dismissed Intel’s claims with prejudice that same month, entering judgment in favor 
of defendants. Intel filed a notice of appeal in December 2021.
In June 2020, affiliates controlled by Fortress Investment Group, which also controls VLSI, acquired Finjan Holdings, Inc. Intel had signed 
a "Settlement, Release and Patent License Agreement" with Finjan in 2012, acquiring a license to the patents of Finjan and its affiliates, 
current or future, through a capture period of November 20, 2022. The agreement also contains covenants wherein Finjan agrees to 
cause its affiliates to comply with the agreement. As such, Intel maintains that it now has a license to the patents of VLSI, which has 
become a Finjan affiliate, and that Finjan must cause VLSI to dismiss its suits against Intel. In August 2020, Intel started dispute resolution 
proceedings under the agreement. As a part of this dispute resolution process, Intel and Finjan held a mediation in December 2020, but 
failed to resolve their differences. Intel filed suit to enforce its rights under the License Agreement with Finjan in January 2021 in Delaware 
Chancery Court . In March 2021, defendants filed motions to dismiss the Chancery Court proceedings. The court heard those motions in 
May 2021, and dismissed all of Intel’s claims—except the breach of contract claim—with prejudice in September 2021 for lack of 
jurisdiction because, the court reasoned, Intel’s license defense has been raised in the other US suits between Intel and VLSI and could 
be adjudicated in one of those actions. The court stayed Intel’s breach of contract claim pending a determination on whether Intel is 
licensed to VLSI’s patents. In September 2020, Intel filed motions to stay the Texas, Delaware, and Shanghai matters pending resolution 
of its dispute with Finjan. In November 2020, Intel filed a motion to stay the Shenzhen matter pending resolution of its dispute with Finjan. 
In November 2020, the Delaware court denied Intel's motion to stay. The other stay motions remain pending. Finally, Intel filed a motion to 
amend its answer in the Texas matters to add a license defense in November 2020, and filed a motion to amend its answer in the 
Delaware matter to add a license defense in February 2021. The Texas court has not yet ruled on Intel’s motion to amend, but the 
Delaware court granted Intel’s motion in July 2021. 
In June 2021, OpenSky Industries LLC (OpenSky) requested IPR of certain claims of the ‘373 and ‘759 patents, including the ones a jury 
said Intel infringes. Both petitions copied Intel’s earlier petitions, and used the expert declarations previously submitted by Intel. Another 
entity named Patent Quality Assurance LLC (PQA) also petitioned for IPR of certain claims of the ’373 patent, including ones a jury said 
Intel infringes. PQA also largely copied Intel’s petition, but added a challenge to an additional claim and included newly signed 
declarations from Intel’s experts. In December 2021, the PTAB instituted OpenSky’s petition on the ‘759 patent, but declined to institute on 
the ‘373 patent. In December 2021, Intel filed a motion to join OpenSky’s ‘759 IPR. A decision on PQA’s IPR petition is expected in 
January 2022 .Table of Contents

Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and 
procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how 
well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The 
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered 
relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute 
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been 
detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of 
the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that  our disclosure controls 
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) , are effective to provide reasonable assurance 
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, 
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding 
required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange 
Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 25, 2021  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, 
our internal control over financial reporting.
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and 
the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.
Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021 . Management based its assessment on 
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission ( 2013 framework ). Management's assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating 
effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the 
fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial 
Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the 
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's 
internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and 
Supplemental Details. Table of Contents
