ITEM 1.
BUSINESS Our Company
With
 a history dating back to 1886 ,  American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility companyin
 the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936 , we employ approximately 
6,900 professionals who  provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to an estimated 15 million people in 46 states, the District ofColumbia
 and Ontario, Canada. The largest component of the Company’s business includes rate regulated subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services,collectively
 presented  as  our “ Regulated  Businesses .”  We conduct  the majority  of our business  through the Regulated  Businesses segment.  We also operateseveral
 market-based  businesses  that  provide  a  broad  range  of  related  and  complementary  water  and  wastewater  services  within four operating  segments thatindividually
 do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Thesefour 
,  non-reportable operating segments are collectively presented as our “ Market-Based  Businesses ,”  which is consistent with how management assesses theresults of these businesses.
Throughout
 this Annual  Report on Form 10-K (this  “Form 10-K”), unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,”and
 “American  Water”  mean  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries,  taken  together  as  a  whole.  References  to  “parent  company”  meanAmerican Water Works Comp
any, Inc., without its subsidiaries.Regulated Businesses
Our
 primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority,fire
 service  and  sale  for  resale  customers.  Our  utilities  operate  in  approximately 1,600 communities  in 16 states  in  the  United  States,  with  approximately 3.4 million 
active  customer  connections  to our water  and wastewater  networks. Services  provided  by our  utilities  are  generally  subject  to  economic  regulation  bycertain
 state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs” or “Regulators”).Certain
 federal,  state  and  local  governments  also  regulate  environmental,  health  and  safety,  and  water  quality  matters.  We  report  the  results  of  the  servicesprovided by
 our utilities in our Regulated Businesses segment. Operating  revenues for our Regulated Businesses were $2,958 million for 2017 , $2,871 million for 2016 
and $2,743 million for 2015 , accounting for 88% , 87% and 87% , respectively, of the Company ’s total operating revenues for the same periods.The

Table of ContentsCustomers
Our 
Regulated Businesses have  a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or any otherentity
 that purchases our water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase our services for use bymultiple individuals or bus
inesses, as is the case in many homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.The vast majority
 of our regulated water customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water usage, typically on a monthlybasis.
 We employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers whereconsumption is
 manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices (touch read)or via radio frequency to 
mobile or fixed network data collectors. Our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption.Residential
 customers make up a substantial portion of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate. We also serve: (i) commercial customers,such as hospitals, food and beverag
e providers and energy suppliers; (ii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations;and
 (iii) public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools. In addition, we supply water through our distributionsystems
 to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes, to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, and toother water utiliti
es and community water systems in the form of bulk water supplies for distribution to their own customers.The following chart depicts 
the allocation of our Regulated Businesses ’ operating revenue by type, including a breakout of the total water services revenuesby class of customer, for th

In  2017, we acquired substantially all of the wastewater collection and treatment system assets of the Municipal Authority of the City of McKeesport, Pennsylvania (the “McKeesportsystem”). This acquisition included approximately 
22,000 customer equivalents  in total; comprised of 11,000 customer connections, which are reflected in  the 2017 residential customercount in the table above, as well as service to an additional 
11,000 customers under bulk contracts to 13 municipalities in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.Customer
 growth in our Regulated  Businesses is  primarily driven by: (i) adding new customers to our customer base through acquisitions of water and/orwastewater utility
 systems; (ii) organic population growth (or decline) in our authorized service areas; and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and communitywater systems.
Capital Investment
On
 an annual basis, approximately 2  trillion gallons  of treated water are lost in the United States through more than 240,000 main  breaks at an estimatedcost
 of $2.6  billion .  This represents approximately 20% of  all treated water in the country. In addition, every year approximately 900  billion gallons  of untreatedsewage
 is  discharged  into  the  country’s  rivers  and  streams.  The  aging  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure  in  the  United  States  is  in  need  of  replacement  andmodernization.
 In 2017, the American Society of Civil Engineers published its Report 
Card
for
America’s
Infrastructure,
in  which it gave the drinking  waterindustry
 a grade of “D” and the wastewater infrastructure a grade of “D+,” primarily because much of the infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life. Asdocumented in the Americ
an Water Works Association’s (the “AWWA”) Buried
No
Longer:
Confronting
America’s
Water
Infras tructure
Challenge
, restoring the country’s
 existing water systems as they reach the end of their useful lives and expanding them to serve a growing population will cost at least $1 trillion between2011
 and 2035, if we are to maintain current levels of water service. In addition, increased regulation related to water quality and the management of water andwastewater
 residuals’ discharges, which began with the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, is also a primary driverfor the need to modernize.
To address
 the growing infrastructure needs in the areas we serve, we plan to invest $7.2 billion over the next  five years, including a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion 
in 2018, for  capital improvements to our Regulated Businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure, largely aimed for pipe replacement and upgradingaging
 water and wastewater treatment facilities. We have proactively doubled our pipe renewal rate over a five year period, from 2011 to 2016, from a 250 yearreplacement
 cycle to a 120 year replacement cycle, which we anticipate will enable us to replace nearly 2,000 miles of mains and collection pipes over the nextfive
 years. In addition, during this same five year period, capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities has increasedover 10%, further addressing 
aging infrastructure and emerging regulatory compliance needs.Economic Regulation and Rate Making
Our 
Regulated  Businesses operate  under  a  regulatory  compact  whereby,  in  exchange  for  exclusive  rights  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  indefined
 service territories, we have an obligation to serve customers within those territories requesting service, within reasonable limits. In return for agreeing toinvest
 capital into our water and wastewater systems, we are given the opportunity to recover our costs of doing business and earn a reasonable rate of return onour investments.
The
 operations of our Regulated  Businesses are  generally subject to economic regulation by PUCs in the state in which they operate, with the primaryresponsibility
 of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ fromstate
 to  state,  but  in  most  states  PUCs  approve  rates  charged  to  customers,  accounting  treatments,  long-term  financing  programs  and  cost  of  capital,  capitalexpenditures,
 O&M expenses, taxes, transactions and affiliate relationships, reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions. Regulatory policies vary from state tostate and
 could potentially change over time. These policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on investedcapital.
5

Table of ContentsThe
 process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the PUC on a periodic basis. The timingof
 rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue to recovercapital
 investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. Our rate case management program is guided by the principlesof
 obtaining timely recovery of capital investment costs, recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption and appropriate recovery of utilityoperating
 and maintenance costs, including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations. The program attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” thetime
 between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates. It is, for example, the time betweenwhen
 an investment in plant is placed into service for the benefit of the customer and when the Company can begin earning a return of and on the investmentthrough the ratemaking pro
cess. It also applies to the lag in the recognition in rate recovery of changes in expenses and revenues.Our 
Regulated  Businesses support  regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. Examples ofapproved regulatory prac
tices include:Regulatory Practices
 Description  States Allowed Infrastructure replacement
surcharges
 
Allows rates to  change periodically,  outside  a general rate proceeding, to  reflect recovery of  investments  made toreplace
 infrastructure  necessary  to  sustain  safe,  reliable  services  for  our  customers.  These  mechanisms  typicallyinvolve periodic filings and reviews, to ensure transparency.
 IA, IL, IN, MO, NJ,NY, PA, TN, VA,
WV
Future test year
 
A test period used for setting rates, that begins with the date new rates are effective. This allows current or projectedrevenues, expenses and investments to be collected on a timelier basis.
 CA, HI, IL, IN, KY,NY, PA, TN, VA
Hybrid test year
 
Allows an update to historical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical testyear.
 IA, MD, MO, NJ,WV
Utility plant recovery
mechanisms
 
Allows  recovery  of  the  full  return  on  utility  plant  costs  during  the  construction  period,  instead  of  capitalizing  anallowance for funds used during construction. In addition, some
 states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certaincapital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval proces
s, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects. CA, IL, KY, NY, PA,TN, VA
Expense mechanisms
 
Allows changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utility’s control,to be recovered outside of a general rate proceeding or deferr
ed until the next general rate proceeding. 
CA, IL, MD, MO,NJ, NY, PA, TN,
VA, WV
Revenue stability
mechanisms
 
Separates a water utility’s  cost recovery from the amount of  water it sells to recover its  fixed costs and on-goinginfrastructure
 investment needs. Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will besufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced
consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently.
 CA, IL, NYConsolidated tariffs
 
Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not bephysically
 interconnected. The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state and isgenerally
 used to prioritize capital investments and moderate the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs whilelowering
 administrative costs for customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenuerequirements.
 IA, IL, IN, KY, MD,MO, NJ, PA, VA,
WV
We
 pursue or seek enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments in order to continue to providesafe,
 reliable and affordable services to our customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state PUCs willaccept our
 proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associated with traditional rate makingprocesses. It is also our str
ategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply.6

Table of ContentsAcquisitions and Strategic Growth
The
 U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governmentsor
 governmental  subdivisions.  Both  industries  are  highly  fragmented.  According  to  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (“EPA”),  approximately 84% of  theUnited
 States water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of  the country’s wastewater systems are government owned. The EPA alsoestimates that
 there are approximately 50,000 community water  systems and approximately 20,000 community  wastewater systems in the United States, with overhalf
 of the community water systems serving a population of 500 or less. This large number of relatively small, fragmented water and wastewater systems mayresult
 in inefficiencies in the marketplace, since such utilities may not have the operating expertise, financial and technological capability or economies of scale toprovide
 services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities. Larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandatedand
 other necessary infrastructure upgrades to their water and wastewater systems. In addition, water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases, spreadacross
 broad geographic regions, may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures, such as droughts, excessive rainand
 cool or warm temperatures in specific areas. Larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base, thereby reducing thecosts
 to serve each customer. Since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale, companies that participatein industry consolidation have 
the potential to improve operating efficiencies, lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time.A
 fundamental aspect of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water and/or wastewater systems of between 1,000 and 30,000customer
 connections, in close geographic proximity to areas where we operate our Regulated Businesses .  The close proximity of acquisition opportunities to ourregulated
 footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using our existing management and to achieve operationalefficiencies and prioritize capital in
vestment needs. Our current customer mix of 94% water and 6% wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewatergrowth
 and systems consolidation, adding wastewater customers where we already serve water customers. We intend to continue to expand our regulated footprintgeographically by
 acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and, if appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities in certain domestic marketswhere
 we do not currently operate our Regulated  Businesses .  Before entering new regulated markets, we will evaluate the business and regulatory climates toensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investme
nt while maintaining our high standards for providing safe, reliableand
 affordable services to our customers, as well as a line of sight to grow our base customers to a significant level to attain efficiencies after entering the newmarket.
More
 stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment andfinancial
 challenges are driving more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets. For example, in 2015, New Jersey enacted the WaterInfrastructure
 Protection Act, which allows municipalities with a water or wastewater system that meets certain emergent conditions, to allow it to sell the systemon
 an expedited basis without a referendum. Also, in 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act, which sets new operational standards for allwater
 utilities  in  New  Jersey,  including  municipal  and  investor-owned  utilities.  This  law  imposes  new  requirements  in  areas  such  as  cybersecurity,  assetmanagement, water qual
ity reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance.We
 also support full optionality for municipalities, including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewaterindustries
 through  fair  market  valuations  of  purchased  property  and  the  consolidation  of  water  and  wastewater  rates.  Our Regulated  Businesses in  California,Illinois,
 Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have access to fair market value legislation for private sector investment in public sector systems. Fairmarket value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, providi
ng municipalitieswith
 a fair and objective purchase price that is more reflective of the assets’ value, while the utility has increased assurance of recovering investment over the lifeof
 the assets. Ultimately, we believe that many communities could benefit from receiving safe and reliable water and wastewater service from an experiencedutility with proven access 
to capital and financial, technical, and managerial resources.Consolidated
 tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected.Consolidated
 tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state.As
 a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest ofsystems
 and prioritize capital needs across the state. Overall, this brings cost-effective, higher quality services to a larger number of citizens. Ten of our regulatedsubsidiaries
 currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,Virginia, and West Virginia.

Table of ContentsCompetition
In
 our Regulated  Businesses ,  we generally do not face direct competition in our existing markets because: (i) we operate in those markets pursuant tocertificates
 of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) issued by state PUCs; and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewatersystem
 in an existing market creates a high barrier to market entry. However, our Regulated  Businesses do  face competition from governmental agencies, otherinvestor-owned
 utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatment process and strategic buyers that are entering newmarkets
 and/or making strategic acquisitions. When pursuing acquisitions, our largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenuesand population served, are Aqua Ame
rica, Inc., Suez North America, American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, wealso face competit
ion from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp. and Corix.Condemnation and Eminent Domain
All
 or portions of our Regulated  Businesses ’  utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of thefollowing
 methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision whenthe
 original certificate of public convenience and necessity was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which theutility
 subsidiary  was  incorporated  or  from  which  it  received  its  certificate.  The  acquisition  consideration  related  to  such  a  proceeding  initiated  by  a  localgovernment may
 be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state orin the particular f
ranchise or charter.Furthermore,
 the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated  Businesses operate,  including, for example, California, provides for eminent domainrights
 allowing private property owners to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantialcause
 of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. These actions have occurred inconnection with events such as f
loods, mudslides and debris flow, broken water mains, landslides and wild and brush fires.Water Supply and Wastewater Services
Our 
Regulated Businesses generally  own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to our customers and collect, treat, transport andrecycle
 wastewater. Typically, we do not own the water itself, which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts, permits and allocation rightsgranted
 by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. We are dependent on defined sources of water supply andobtain
 our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers; and waterpurchased
 from third party water suppliers. The level of treatment we apply to the water varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source andcustomer stipulations. 
Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment, while groundwater sources require chemical treatment only.8

Table of ContentsThe following chart depicts ou
r sources of water supply as of December 31, 2017 : 
The percentages of water supp
ly by source type for our top seven states for 2017 were as follows:  
Surface Water  Ground Water  Purchased Water New Jersey
72%  24%  4% Pennsylvania
91%  7%  2% Illinois
53%  36%  11% Missouri
80%  19%  1% Indiana

100%  —  — Our
 ability  to  meet  the  existing  and  future  water  demands  of  our  customers  depends  on  an  adequate  water  supply.  Drought,  governmental  restrictions,overuse
 of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water.We
 employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversityof our
 service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular serviceterritory.
 For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce the amount of source water available,while other areas we serve 
may experience wetter than average weather.9

Table of ContentsIn
 our  long-term  planning,  we  evaluate  quality,  quantity,  growth  needs  and  alternate  sources  of  water  supply  as  well  as  transmission  and  distributioncapacity. Water supply 
is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that we have adequate water supply,we use
 long-term planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range ofweather
 fluctuations. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, we employ models to determine safe yields under differentrainfall
 and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predictedand
 mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of our use of long-term planning to ensure that we have adequatewater
 supply is our involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includesthe
 construction of a desalination plant, owned by California-American Water Company (“Cal Am”), our wholly owned subsidiary, and the construction of wellsthat
 would  supply  water  to  the  desalination  plant.  In  addition,  the  Water  Supply  Project  also  includes  Cal  Am’s  purchase  of  water  from  a  groundwaterreplenishment project between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Age
ncy and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”).The
 Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of Cal Am to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as requiredunder orders of the Californ
ia State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”).Wastewater
 services  involve  the  collection  of  wastewater  from  customers’  premises  through  sewer  lines.  The  wastewater  is  then  transported  through  asewer
 network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solidwaste by-product of the tre
atment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.Seasonality
Customer
 demand for our water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and the frequency of rainfall. Customerdemand
 is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, wetypically
 expect  our  operating  revenues  to  be  the  highest  in  the  third  quarter  of  each  year.  Weather  that  is  hotter  and  drier  than  average  generally  increasesoperating
 revenues whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operatingrevenues.
 Three  of  our  jurisdictions,  California,  Illinois  and  New  York,  have  adopted  revenue  stability  mechanisms  which  permit  us  to  collect  state  PUC-authorized
 revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See “Economic Regulation and Rate Mak
ing ” for additional infor mation regarding revenue stability mechanisms.Market-Based Businesses
Through
 our Market-Based  Businesses ,  we  provide  a  broad  range  of  related  and  complementary  water  and  wastewater  services  to  military  bases,municipalities,
 gas  exploration  and  production  companies,  as  well  as  commercial,  industrial  and  residential  customers.  These  businesses  are  not  subject  toeconomic
 regulation by state PUCs and the services provided do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for our Market-Based Businesses were 
$422  million for 2017 , $451 million for 2016 and $434 million for 2015 ,  accounting  for 13% , 14% and 14% ,  respectively,  of  the  Company’s  totaloperating
 revenues for the same periods. Included within our Market-Based  Businesses ’  results is operating revenues attributed to Canadian operations of $5 million 
for 2017 and $6 million for both 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Our 
Market-Based Businesses are comprised of four operating segments: •
Military  Services  Group,  which  enters  into  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  on  variousmilitary bases;
•
Homeowner  Services Group, which provides warranty-type services to homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against the cost ofrepairing broken or leak
ing water pipes and clogged or blocked sewer pipes on their premises, and other services;•
Contract  Operations Group, which enters into contracts with municipal, commercial and industrial customers, primarily to operate and manage waterand wastewater facilities an
d other related services; and•
Keystone  Clearwater Solutions, LLC (“Keystone”), which provides customized water service and management solutions for natural gas explorationand production companies and cus
tomers in the municipal water services market.10

Table of ContentsMilitary Services Group
Our
 Military Services Group has been granted contracts to operate on 13 military bases under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government as part of itsUtility
 Privatization Program. See Item  7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Strategic  Focus and 2017Achievements—Growth
 for additional information. The scope of these contracts generally includes the O&M of the bases’ water and wastewater systems and acapital
 program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to theCompany
 is funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the base’s mission and the construction of these assets are funded by theU.S.
 government as additional work under the contract. The current capital program does not use the Company’s equity or debt borrowings; however, we maymake
 limited  short-term  working  capital  investments  under  these  contracts  and  some  working  capital  is  used  to  fund  work-in-process  until  paid  by  the  U.S.government.
The
 contract price for nine of  our contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and everythree
 years  thereafter.  Price  redetermination  is  a  contract  mechanism  to  periodically  adjust  the  service  fee  in  the  next  period  to  reflect  changes  in  contractobligations
 and anticipated market conditions. The remaining four contracts  with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanismsimilar
 to price redetermination, called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All of these contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-yearterm
 for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant totermination provisions app
licable to these contracts, we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract, plus the contractprofit
 margin on incurred costs. Our backlog of revenue associated with our contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $3.6  billion ,  with an averageremaining contract 
term of 42 years.Homeowner Services Group
Our
 Homeowner Services Group, through our various protection programs, provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customersto protect against repair costs for
 interior and external water and sewer lines, interior electric lines, heating and cooling systems and water heaters, as well as powersurge
 protection  and  other  related  services.  Our  LineSaver™  program  involves  partnering  with  utilities,  municipalities  and  other  organizations  to  offer  ourprotection programs to customers serviced
 by or affiliated with those municipalities and organizations. Terms of these partnership agreements are typically three tofive
 years in length, with optional renewals. As of December  31, 2017 ,  our Homeowner Services Group had approximately 1.7  million customer  contracts in 43 states and the District o
f Columbia, and 10 LineSaver™ partnership agreements with municipalities and other organizations.Contract Operations Group
Our
 Contract Operations Group enters into contracts to provide O&M services, including the delivery of design-build-operate projects and the provision ofwater
 and wastewater operations, maintenance and management services, to municipal and regional governmental entities through public-private partnerships, aswell
 as industrial customers who possess a wide range of water quality and regulatory compliance needs. Historically, we have made minimal long-term capitalinvestment
 under these contracts; instead we perform our services for a fee. Occasionally, we provide our customers with financing for capital projects as part of along-term O&M
 partnership. As of December 31, 2017 , our  Contract Operations Group had 33 contracts across the United States and Canada, varying in size andscope,
 with  an  average  remaining  contract  term  of  3 years.  In  the  course  of  pursuing  our  long-term  strategy  and  growth  initiatives  for  our  Market-BasedBusinesses,
 we  will  concentrate  on  optimizing  the  portfolio  of  contracts  in  our  Contract  Operations  Group,  which  will  involve  strategic  decisions  around  thepursuit of renewals of our cur
rent contracts approaching expiration, as well as the sale of certain contracts that fall outside of our strategic focus.Keystone
In
 July 2015, we acquired a 95% interest  in Water Solutions Holdings, LLC, including its wholly owned subsidiary, Keystone. Keystone is a water serviceand
 management solutions company that serves natural gas exploration and production customers in the Appalachian Basin, as well as customers in the municipalwater
 services market. Keystone is primarily focused on customized water transfer, sourcing, recycling and storage services, along with pipeline construction andrelated
 O&M services. Keystone operates under master service agreements that are generally shorter term in nature. When the initial term of these agreementsexpire,
 they typically renew automatically on an annual basis and generally are cancelable by either party with 30 days prior notice. As of December  31, 2017 , Keystone serves approximate
ly 35 customers.11

Table of ContentsCompetition
We
 face  competition  in  our Market-Based  Businesses from  a  number  of  service  providers,  including  American  States  Water  Company,  Suez  NorthAmerica,
 and Veolia Environnement S.A. in our Military Services Group, and Pivotal Home Solutions (owned by Southern Company Gas) and HomeServe USAin
 our Homeowner Services Group. Our Contract Operations Group competes in a highly competitive market in order to secure new O&M contracts, as thesecontracts
 are  awarded  based  on  a  combination  of  customer  relationships,  service  levels,  competitive  pricing,  references  and  technical  expertise.  We  also  facecompetition
 in  maintaining  existing  O&M  contracts  to  which  we  are  a  party,  as  the  municipal  and  industrial  fixed  term  contracts  frequently  come  up  forrenegotiation and are
 subject to an open bidding process. Competitors of our Contract Operations Group include Suez North America, Veolia Environnement S.A.,Inframark, LLC
 and Woodard & Curran. Keystone currently faces competition from water service providers that typically provide particular segments of the watermanagement cycle, such 
as Select Energy Services, Inc., TETRA Technologies, Inc. and Fluid Delivery Solutions, LLC.Environmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation
Our
 water  and  wastewater  operations,  including  the  services  provided  by  both  our Regulated  Businesses and Market-Based Businesses ,  are  subject  toextensive
 federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of theenvironment,
 health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water we deliver to our customers, andthe
 manner in which we collect, treat, discharge, recycle and dispose of wastewater. These regulations include the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Lead and CopperRule
 (“LCR”), the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. We are subject to various federal, state, local and Canadian laws andregulations
 governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup ofcontaminated
 sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. State PUCs also set conditions and standardsfor the water and wastewate
r services we deliver.Environmental,
 health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently. For example, in 2017, the New Jersey Department ofEnvironmental
 Protection  announced  that  it  would  seek  to  adopt  more  stringent  maximum  contaminant  levels  for  perfluorooctoanic  acid,  or  PFOA,  andperfluorononanoic acid, or PF
NA. The overall trend has been that they have become increasingly stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced,our
 capital and operating costs could increase. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water qualitystandards
 to which our operations are subject. In the past, our Regulated  Businesses have  generally been able to recover the costs associated with compliance;however,
 this  recovery  is  affected  by  regulatory  lag  and  the  corresponding  uncertainties  surrounding  rate  recovery.  We  estimate  that  we  will  make  capitalexpenditures
 of $96  million during 2018 and $138 million during 2019 for  environmental control facilities, which we define for this purpose as any project (orportion
 thereof)  that  involves  the  preservation  of  air,  water  or  land.  We  also  maintain  an  environmental  program  that  includes  responsible  business  practices,compliance
 with environmental laws and regulations, and effective use of natural resources. We believe that our operations are materially in compliance with, andin many cases surpass, minimu
m standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.Our
 operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our water and wastewater treatment facilitiesstore
 and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. We alsocould
 incur remedial costs in connection  with any contamination  relating  to our operations  or facilities  or our off-site disposal of wastes. The ComprehensiveEnvironmental
 Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmentalauthorities,
 to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined topresent an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substa
nces. Parties thatgenerated or
 transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as the owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, underCERCLA
 or comparable state laws. Although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or theimposition
 of  such  obligations  in  the  future  could  result  in  additional  costs.  Our  facilities  and  operations  are  also  subject  to  requirements  under  the  U.S.Occupational
 Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder. Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmentalmatters. See 
Item 3—Legal Proceedings for additional information. Safe Drinking Water Act
The
 Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levelsof numerous, naturally occu
rring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose newrules.
 These  rules  also  prescribe  testing  requirements  for  detecting  regulated  contaminants,  the  treatment  systems  that  may  be  used  for  removing  thosecontaminants,
 and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water, and there is aprocess in place to make 
a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.12

Table of ContentsTo
 help  formulate  the  basis  for  future  regulations,  the  EPA  has  the  authority  to  require  monitoring  for  additional,  unregulated  contaminants  under  theUnregulated
 Contaminant Monitoring Rule (the “Rule”). Our laboratory and many of our treatment systems are preparing for the fourth round of testing under theRule,
 which  will  begin  in  2018.  There  are  thousands  of  other  chemical  compounds  that  are  not  regulated,  many  of  which  are  lacking  a  testing  methodology,occurrence
 data, health effects information and/or treatment technology. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but weactively
 participate with the EPA and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See Item 1—Business—Researchand Development—Emerging Contain
ments for further discussion.To
 effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinkingwater and
 to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and by-products of the disinfection process. In 2006, the EPA issued the Long-Term 2 Enhanced SurfaceWater
 Treatment Rule and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule and, later in 2006, finalized the Ground Water Rule, applicable to systemsproviding water from underground source
s. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levelsrequires
 an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. We are within the EPA’s time frame for compliance of these standards, which includes sample collection,data
 analysis, engineering planning and system implementation. Recent monitoring under the Long-Term 2 Rule has resulted in the need for more than 30 of oursurface
 water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium. In most cases, this will involve installing UV disinfection at an estimated costranging
 from $150 million to $250 million. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalentchromium,
 fluoride, nitrosamines, perchlorate, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. We do not anticipate that any such regulations, ifenacted, will require 
implementation in 2018.Across
 the Company, we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous on-line
 instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. Weparticipate
 in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 68 of our 72 surface
 water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that: (i) have completed a comprehensive self-assessmentreport; (ii)
 created an action plan for continuous improvement; and (iii) produced high quality drinking water, we account for approximately one-third of the plantsreceiving such
 awards nationwide. In addition, 66 of our surface water treatment plants have received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 61 plants have received the“Ten-Year Phase III” award 
and 54 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award statusfor
 five, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Further, nine of  our surface  water plants have received  the “Presidents”  award, which recognizes  treatment  plants thatachieve the Partnership
’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards.Although
 it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, we expect current requirementsunder the Safe Drinking Water Act
 and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to havea
 material impact on our operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have beentraditionally
 recognized  by  the  state  PUCs  as  appropriate  for  inclusion  in  establishing  rates.  As  a  result,  we  expect  to  recover  the  operating  and  capital  costsresulting from these pen
ding or future requirements.Lead and Copper Rule and Lead in Drinking Water Act
Across
 the country, there is a renewed focus on the potential risk of lead in drinking water. In 1991, the EPA published the LCR to control lead and copperin
 drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In2011,
 Congress  enacted  the  Reduction  of  Lead  in  Drinking  Water  Act  regarding  the  use  and  introduction  into  commerce  of  lead  pipes,  plumbing  fittings  forfixtures,
 solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily inbuilding plumbing, still remain in many communities. The E
PA is currently working to develop long-term revisions to the LCR, with a revised draft likely in 2018.It
 is currently estimated that approximately 5% of our service lines contain lead. We have reviewed our related practices and are working with stakeholders todevelop
 feasible solutions to remove legacy lead from service lines in older neighborhoods. A fundamental step in this effort is the ongoing project to inventorylead
 service lines across our footprint. Our goal is to replace our lead service lines in most areas over an approximate 10 year time frame, at an estimated costranging from $600 million to $1.2 b
illion. In cases where we are replacing an American Water owned lead service line, our standard approach will be to replace thecompany-owned portion of the service line, and work with
 the customer to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line. Replacing the full service line isconsidered
 a  best  practice  as  advised  by  the  Lead  Service  Line  Replacement  Collaborative,  an  association  of  leading  water  industry  organizations.  Theprioritization of this work will depend on several factors, including o
ur planned water main and service line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities orother utilities, LCR compli
ance monitoring results and cooperation with our customers with respect to the customer-owned portion of the service line.13

Table of ContentsClean Water Act
The Clean Water Act regul
ates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition torequirements applicable
 to our wastewater collection systems, our operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System(“NPDES”) permit program establishe
d under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA andimplementing
 states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limitsspecified
 under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant penalties and compliance costs. Inaddition,
 the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdens on our operations.From
 time to time, discharge violations occur at our facilities, some of which result in fines. We do not expect any such violations or fines to have a materialimpact on our results of ope
rations or financial condition.Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance
Integrating
 environmental, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”) policies and practices into our daily operations emphasizes our belief that the onlyway
 to do business is to do it responsibly, by delivering value to our customers, building strong communities, leveraging innovation to develop our industry andsupporting
 the expertise and dedication of our people. This focus is derived from our vision statement, “clean water for life”, and our core values: (i) safety; (ii)trust; (iii)
 environmental leadership; (iv) teamwork; and (v) high performance, the principles by which we work and live. Our vision and values drive our companystrategy, which is ce
ntered on five central themes: •
Customers—Our  customers are at the center of everything we do, helping us to shape our strategic priorities. We challenge ourselves so that if ourregulated utility cus
tomers had a choice of providers, we would want them to choose us.•
Safety—The safety of our emp loyees and our customers is the number one focus for American Water.•

Research and Development
Our Research and Development Program
We
 maintain  an  industry-leading  Research  and  Development  (“R&D”)  program  that  is  designed  to  enhance  our  services,  help  ensure  compliance,  andimprove
 quality  and  operational  effectiveness.  Our  R&D  personnel  are  located  in  New  Jersey  and  Illinois,  the  latter  housing  our  quality  control  and  testinglaboratory,
 which supports our R&D activities through testing and analysis. Approximately one-third of our research budget is funded by competitively awardedoutside
 research grants. Such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers. I n 2017 ,  we spent $3 million 
on research in total, in cluding $1 million funded by grants. Spending on research amounted to $4 million , including $1 million funded by grants, in each of 2016 
and 2015 . We
 continue  to leverage  the Company’s expertise  and collaborate  with the EPA to help establish  effective  environmental,  health and safety,  and waterquality standards and regulation. This relationship includes the
 sharing of our research, such as our treatment and distribution system optimization research and ourand
 national water quality monitoring data. Our engagement with the EPA provides us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, therebyallowing
 us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements. We also frequently engage with the Centers for Disease Control and other stateenvironmental
 agencies.  We  believe  that  continued  R&D  activities  are  critical  for  providing  safe,  reliable  and  affordable  services,  as  well  as  maintaining  ourleadership position in the 
industry, which provides us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers.Emerging Contaminants
Emerging
 contaminants  include  chemicals  such  as  pharmaceuticals,  personal  care  products,  pesticides,  herbicides  and  endocrine  disrupting  compounds,which
 have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood and/or has not been quantified. While thesecontaminants
 have been present in our drinking water for as long as they have been in use, technological advances have only recently made it possible to detectmany
 of  them.  The  ability  to  detect  contaminants,  even  at  trace  levels,  has  raised  questions  among  regulators  and  government  agencies,  further  affecting  thepublic’s perception of dr
inking water quality.The
 Chemicals  Abstract  Service  Registry  contains  over  130  million  registered  chemicals,  with  a  new  substance  being  produced  approximately  every  3seconds
 from chemical breakdown and reformation. We are continually investigating new substances and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineersand
 public health professionals to identify threats to our water supply, to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories, and to research the influx ofadvanced
 treatment technologies. We maintain state-of-the-art water quality testing equipment and implement new and emerging technologies to help predict andmanage potential wate
r supply contamination issues. Examples of our efforts include:•
using  our research findings to communicate information to our customers (via a web site) on the actions they can take to manage Legionella (theCenters
 for Disease Control statistics indicate that water-associated disease from Legionella is on the rise, with exposure typically associated withplumbing systems in large bui
ldings);•
aerial  drone  testing  to  detect  harmful  algal  blooms  and  ultrasonic  technology  testing  to  help  prevent  taste  and  odor  events  and  to  eliminatecyanotoxins before they get 
to the water treatment plant;•
the  implementation of water  source assessment tools, including sensors and analytics, to  evaluate and track chemical storage and transport throughwatersheds and to detect sour
ce water contamination events; and15

the implementation of activated car bon and biofiltration for the control of emerging contaminants.Support Services

RISK FACTORS We
 operate  in  a  market  and  regulatory  environment  that  involves  significant  risks,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control.  In  addition  to  the  otherinformation
 included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects.Any
 of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flowsand liquidity.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations
Our
 utility  operations  are  subject  to  extensive  economic  regulation  by  state  PUCs  and  other  regulatory  agencies,  which  significantly  affects  our  business,financial
 condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our utility operations also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for the inability tomeet these regulatory requirem
ents.Our 
Regulated  Businesses provide  water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to economic regulation by statePUCs.
 Economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations. Generally, the statePUCs
 authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operatingand maintenance costs, dep
reciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.Our
 ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rateincrease
 applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, ormay be partially approv
ed, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to:•
cover our expenses, including pur chased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;•
enable us to recover our inv estment; and•
provide us with an opportunity to ea rn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.Approval
 of the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financialpenalties,
 fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits, approvalsand
 certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions. Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or soughtrenewal
 of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activitiesmay have on our business.
In any of these
 cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if rates are sufficient,we
 face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certain conditionsexist, including but not limited to, if water
 usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than thelevel estimated in 
establishing rates.18

Table of ContentsOur
 operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety lawsand
 regulations, including with respect to emerging contaminants, compliance with which could impact our operating costs, and violations of which couldsubject us to substantial liabiliti
es and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.Our
 water  and  wastewater  operations  and  the  operations  of  our Market-Based  Businesses are  subject  to  extensive  federal,  state  and  local  laws  andregulations and,
 in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, health and safety, the qualityof
 the  water  we  deliver  to  our  customers,  water  allocation  rights,  and  the  manner  in  which  we  collect,  treat,  discharge  and  dispose  of  wastewater.  Theserequirements
 include  CERCLA,  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  the  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act,  and  similar  state  and  Canadian  laws  and  regulations.  For  example,CERCLA
 authorizes the EPA to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect toactual or threatened releases
 of hazardous substances, and can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, on responsible parties for the costs thereof.We are also required to o
btain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.In addition,
 state PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If we deliver water or wastewater services to ourcustomers
 that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental  laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and waterquality
 regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to our reputation. In the most serious cases, regulatorscould
 reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality. Given the nature ofour business which, in part, involves sup
plying water for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of, environmental, water quality andhealth and safety laws or r
egulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry.We
 incur  substantial  operating  and  capital  costs  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  comply  with  environmental,  water  quality  and  health  and  safety  laws  andregulations.
 These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, generally have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increaseour
 costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates, there can be no guarantee that thevarious
 state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated  Businesses would  approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs orthat such costs will not mat
erially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We
 may also incur liabilities if, under environmental laws and regulations, we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at ourproperties, including potential spills of hazardous chemicals, such as
 chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of wasteor caused an
 adverse environmental impact. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result insignificant
 costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may not be covered byinsurance and may make it
 difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.Attention
 is being given to emerging contaminants, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatorystandard
 in  drinking  water  or  have  been  recently  created  or  discovered  (including  by  means  of  scientific  achievements  in  the  analysis  and  detection  of  traceamounts
 of  substances).  Examples  of  sources  of  emerging  contaminants  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  newly  created  chemical  compounds  (including,  forexample,
 perfluorinated  compounds  and  manufactured  nanomaterials);  human  and  veterinary  products;  microbes,  viruses,  amoebae  and  other  pathogens;  andresidual
 by-products  of  disinfection.  We  rely  upon  governmental  agencies  to  set  appropriate  regulatory  standards  to  protect  the  public  from  these  and  othercontaminants.
 Our role is to meet or surpass those standards, when established. In some of our states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part,for
 implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapid pace at whichemerging
 contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system orsupplies,
 which  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  reputation.  In  addition,  we  believe  emergingcontaminants may
 form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could significantly increasethe cost of our operations.

Table of ContentsLimitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of
 water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect ouraccess to sources of water, our ability to suppl
y water to customers or the demand for our water services.Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depen
ds on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources ofpublic
 water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers, are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests. As a result, wetypically
 do  not  own  the  water  that  we  use  in  our  operations,  and  the  availability  of  our  water  supply  is  established  through  allocation  rights  (determined  bylegislation
 or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements set by governmental entities. Passing-flow requirements set minimum volumes of water that mustpass through specified
 water sources, such as rivers and streams, in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users.Allocation rights are
 imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing-flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smallerrivers,
 lakes  and  streams.  These  requirements,  which  can  change  from  time  to  time,  may  adversely  impact  our  water  supply.  Supply  issues,  such  as  drought,overuse of sources of water, th
e protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water.For example, in
 our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an October20,
 2009 cease and desist order (the “2009 Order”), as amended by an order in July 2016 (the “2016 Order”), of the SWRCB that requires Cal Am to significantlydecrease
 its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Deadline”). We are alsorequired to augment our Monterey County source
s of water supply to comply with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. We cannot predict whether CalAm will be able to secure alternative sources of water, or if Cal Am will be ex
posed to liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2021 Deadline under the 2009 Order andthe
 2016 Order. If Cal Am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water, or if other adverse consequences result from theevents
 described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. See Item  3—Legal Proceedings — Alternative Water Supply 
in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, which includes additional information regarding this matter.The
 current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as “regulatory lag,” from the time that we invest in infrastructureimprovements,
 incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate caseapplications; our inability to mini
mize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.There
 is typically a delay, known as “regulatory lag,” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operatingexpense
 increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based onthe
 volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by decliningusage
 and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverseeffect on our financi
al condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.We endeavor to reduce
 regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory policies. For example, ten of our state PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside ofthe
 rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement of aging infrastructure. These surcharges areadjusted
 periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures, and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capitalinvestment is
 incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, nine of our state PUCs allow us to use future test years, which extend beyondthe
 date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis. Other examplesof
 such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control, such as purchased water costs, property orother
 taxes,  or  power,  conservation,  chemical  or  other  expenditures.  These  surcharge  mechanisms  enable  us  to  adjust  rates  in  less  time  after  costs  have  beenincurred than would be the cas
e under the rate case application process.     While
 these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag inthose
 jurisdictions that have not approved such programs. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continuein
 their current form, or at all. Although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state PUC approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag, ourefforts
 may not be successful, or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag, in which case our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, cash flo
ws and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.20

Table of ContentsChanges in laws
 and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flowsand liquidity.
New
 legislation, regulations, government policies or court decisions, including without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other taxlaws,
 can  materially  affect  our  operations,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  The  individuals  who  serve  as  regulators  are  elected  or  political  appointees.Therefore,
 elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulatorsand
 the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy,including
 those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences,among others:
•
making it more diffi cult for us to raise our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;•
changing the determina tion of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases;•
restricting  our  ability  to  terminate  our  services  to  customers  who  owe  us  money  for  services  previously  provided  or  limiting  our  bill  collectionefforts;
•
requiring us to provide water o r wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;•
limiting  or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dispose of assets or issue securities, or making it less cost-effective for us to do so;
•
negatively  impacting the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, the amount of tax credits or tax abatement benefits that may beavailable, the amount o
f taxes owed, or the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;•
changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;•
increasing the costs assoc iated with complying with environmental, health, safety and water quality regulations to which our operations are subject;•
changing or placing addition al limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;•
making  it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, orfor governmental agenc
ies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;•
placing  limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between aregulated subsidiary and us or ou
r other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;•
restricting or prohibiting  our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and•
revoking or altering the terms of the certificates of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) issued to us by state PUCs.Any of the foregoing consequences cou
ld have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.21

Table of ContentsIn
 addition, new Federal, state and local laws, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof, could impact us. OnDecember
 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,including
 a  reduction  in  the  maximum  U.S.  federal  corporate  income  tax  rate  from  35%  to  21%  as  of  January  1,  2018,  and  certain  other  provisions  relatedspecifically
 to  the  public  utility  industry,  including  continuation  of  interest  expense  deductibility,  the  exclusion  from  utilizing  bonus  depreciation  and  thenormalization
 of deferred income taxes. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017results
 of operations and financial position. We have assumed that the predominant majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our utility subsidiaries willremain
 subject to a normalization method of accounting pursuant to the U.S. tax code or applicable PUC regulations and that we will be able to deduct for U.S.federal
 corporate income tax purposes substantially all of our interest expense, based upon our interpretation of U.S. tax law debt allocation methodologies , at theTCJA’s
 21%  corporate  tax  rate.  The  adoption  or  issuance  of  any  Related  Interpretations  that  impact  these  assumptions  or  with  respect  to  provisions  relatedspecifically
 to the public utility industry or to corporate taxpayers in general may also impact our future financial performance, including our results of operations,cash flows and liquidity, which imp
acts will largely be determined through future regulatory proceedings. All of our 14 jurisdictions subject to economic regulationhave
 opened formal proceedings related to the TCJA, and we have open rate cases in three of them. At this time, we cannot predict the impacts of any RelatedInterpretations, if
 and when issued, on us, or the regulatory treatment of the TCJA in each of our regulatory jurisdictions. Moreover, we are unable to determine orpredict the potentia
l impacts, if any, of any other new or amended laws, rules or regulations, or interpretations thereof, to the extent they may be ultimately enacted,adopted or issued, on us or our businesses, f
inancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Service
 disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand forour water services, which could adversely aff
ect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Service
 interruptions  due  to  severe  weather,  climate  variability  patterns  and  other  natural  events  are  possible  across  all  our  businesses.  These  include,among
 other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, wildfires, coastal and intercoastal floods orhigh
 water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, severe electrical storms and solar flares. Weather and other natural events such as thesemay
 affect the condition or operability of our facilities, limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us tomake substantial capi
tal expenditures to repair any damage. Tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not providereimbursement to us, in whole o
r in part, for any of these impacts.Government
 restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers,which
 may  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Seasonal  drought  conditions  that  may  impact  our  water  services  arepossible
 across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of thesupply
 adequacy of any individual system. As examples, drought conditions had persisted in California over a five-year period, and had been declared in NewJersey
 in 2016. In 2017, these droughts were declared concluded, but other droughts that may occur from time to time may result in the imposition of voluntary ormandatory
 water use targets, rationing restrictions, water conservation regulations, and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While expenses incurred inimplementing
 water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant PUC determines they were reasonable and prudent, wecannot
 assure  that  any  such  expenses  incurred  will,  in  fact,  be  fully  recovered.  Moreover,  reductions  in  water  consumption,  including  those  resulting  frominstallation of
 equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended, which could adverselyaffect our business, finan
cial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Climate
 variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of whichmay not be fully recoverable 
in rates or otherwise.The
 issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in thefuture
 associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, suchas:
•
increased frequency and du ration of droughts;•
increased precipit ation and flooding;•
challenges associated wit h changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;•
potential degradation o f water quality;•
decreases in availab le water supply and changes in water usage patterns;•
increases in disruptions in s ervice;•
increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or22

Table of Contents•
increased  costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of ourwater production and delive
ry facilities and systems.Because
 of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition,results
 of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our Regulated Businesses could be recoveredthrough
 rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases toenable us to recover such exp
enditures and costs, in whole or in part.A
 loss  of  one  or  more  large  industrial  customers  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  upon  the  results  of  operations  of  one  or  more  of  our  RegulatedBusinesses.
Adverse
 economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers, particularly industrial customers, to curtail operations. A curtailment of operationsby
 an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent.Any decrease
 in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and resultsof operations. Tariffs in p
lace with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.Our 
Regulated  Businesses require  significant  capital  expenditures  and  may  suffer  if  we  fail  to  secure  appropriate  funding  to  make  investments,  or  if  weexperience delays in comple
ting major capital expenditure projects.The
 water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. We invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant andequipment, and to
 improve aging infrastructure. In 2017 , we invested $1.4 billion in  net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expendituresnecessary
 to maintain the integrity of our systems will likely increase in the future. We expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated fromoperations,
 borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt. We may not be able to access ourrevolving
 credit  facility  or  the  commercial  paper,  long-term  debt  and  equity  capital  markets,  when  necessary  or  desirable  to  fund  capital  improvements  onfavorable
 terms or at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we could be unable to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, fund ourcapital
 investment  strategies,  meet  our  growth  targets  and  expand  our  rate  base  to  enable  us  to  earn  satisfactory  future  returns  on  our  investments.  Even  withadequate
 financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time, as aresult
 of construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, or other obstacles. Each of these outcomes couldadversely affect our 
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Seasonality could adversely affe
ct the volume of water sold and our revenues.The
 volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increasedwater usage for irriga
tion systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months,the
 volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer monthsare cooler than norma
l, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.Three
 of our jurisdictions, California, Illinois and New York, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms, which permit us to collect state PUC-authorizedrevenue for
 a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recoverthe fixed cost
 of operations while supporting water conservation goals. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, operating resultscould continue to be affe
cted by seasonality.Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the co
llection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs.The
 wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. Ifcollection,
 treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby propertiesor
 into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is most acute during periods ofsubstantial
 rainfall  or  flooding,  which  are  the  main  causes  of  sewer  overflow  and  system  failure.  Liabilities  resulting  from  such  damage  could  adversely  andmaterially aff
ect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.23

Table of ContentsContamination
 of  water  supplies  or  our  water  service  provided  to  our  customers  could  result  in  service  limitations  and  interruptions  and  exposure  tosubstances
 not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations,government enforcement actions, damage 
to our reputation and private litigation.The
 water  supplies  that  flow  into  our  treatment  plants  or  are  delivered  through  our  distribution  system,  or  the  water  service  that  is  provided  to  ourcustomers, may be subject 
to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems,pollution
 resulting from man-made sources (such as perchlorate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, lead and other materials, chemical spills or other accidents that resultin
 contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks. In addition, new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water treatmentindustry.
 If one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may haveto take
 responsive actions that could include, among other things (1) continuing limited use of the water supply under a “Do Not Use” protective order that enablescontinuation
 of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply. If service is disrupted, our financial condition, resultsof
 operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated sourcethrough the
 expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new treatment methods. We may be unable to recover costs associated with treatingor
 decontaminating  water supplies through insurance,  customer  rates, tariffs  or contract  terms. Any recovery  of these costs that  we are able to obtain throughregulatory proceedings or o
therwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcementactions or toxic tort or o
ther lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies.In
 this regard, on January 9, 2014, a chemical storage tank owned by Freedom Industries, Inc. leaked two substances into the Elk River near the WestVirginia-American
 Water Company (“WVAWC”) treatment plant intake in Charleston, West Virginia. On September 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for theSouthern
 District of West Virginia granted preliminary approval of a settlement class and proposed global class action settlement (the “Settlement”) of claimsinvolving
 WVAWC and its affiliates arising out of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. Under the terms of the Settlement, WVAWC has agreed that it will notseek
 rate recovery from the Public Service Commission of West Virginia (the “PSC”) for the amounts paid by WVAWC, net of insurance recoveries, under theSettlement.
 See Item  3—Legal Proceedings —West  Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill, which includes additional information regarding thismatter.
Since
 we  engage  in  the  business  of  providing  water  service  to  our  customers,  contamination  of  the  water  supply,  or  the  water  service  provided  to  ourcustomers,
 could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Suchclaims
 could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may bebrought by
 our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur, andwe
 may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to our reputationmay
 occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination orhazardous
 substances in the water or water supplies. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductiblesand
 other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
We may sustain losses that exceed or are ex
cluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.We
 maintain  insurance  coverage  as  part  of  our  overall  legal  and  risk  management  strategy  to  minimize  potential  liabilities  arising  from  our  utilityoperations,
 as well as the operations of our Market-Based  Businesses .  Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits,  exclusions and maximums, andinsurance
 companies  may  seek  to  deny  claims  we  might  make.  Generally,  our  insurance  policies  cover  property  damage,  worker’s  compensation,  employer’sliability,
 general liability, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims.As a result, we may sustain losses th
at exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.Although
 in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriateinsurance
 in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limitedcoverage, increased pr
emium costs or deductibles.24

Table of ContentsWe
 are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatoryoversight or other sanctions.
Water and wastewater ut
ilities, including our regulated subsidiaries and our Market-Based Businesses , have a large direct and indirect customer base and asa result are exposed to publ
ic criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of their water, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of waterprovided,
 and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment mayrender legislatures
 and other governing bodies, state PUCs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, andmay
 cause  us  to  be  susceptible  to  less  favorable  legislative,  regulatory  and  economic  outcomes,  as  well  as  increased  regulatory  or  other  oversight  and  morestringent
 regulatory or economic requirements. Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulationsgoverning
 our  operations  and  less  favorable  economic  terms  in  our  agreements  related  to  our Market-Based  Businesses ,  as  well  as  fines,  penalties  or  othersanctions or requiremen
ts. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations andcash flows.
The
 failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cashflows and liquidity.
The
 properties of our Regulated  Businesses segment  include 80 dams, a failure of any of which could result in personal injury and downstream propertydamage for
 which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and couldadversely
 affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered byinsurance policies or be 
recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.We
 also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has beenmaterial.
 The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entailmaterial
 costs. Although in most cases, the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able torecover
 costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result ofregulatory lag can af
fect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Any
 failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition andreputation.
Our
 operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the UnitedStates.
 A failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable. The failure of major pipes and reservoirsmay
 also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability tosupply
 water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators, includingstate
 PUCs  with  jurisdiction  over  our  operations,  and  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  cash  flows,  liquidity  and  reputation.  Anybusiness
 interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secureinsurance
 at  acceptable  rates  in  the  future.  Moreover,  to  the  extent  such  business  interruptions  or  other  losses  are  not  covered  by  insurance,  they  may  not  berecovered through rate 
adjustments.An
 important  part  of  our  growth  strategy  is  the  acquisition  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  involves  risks,  including  competition  for  acquisitionopportunities from other regulated utili
ties, governmental entities and other buyers, that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.An important element
 of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and move into new, serviceareas.
 We may not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisitioncandidates.
 Further,  competition  for  acquisition  opportunities  from  other  regulated  utilities,  governmental  entities,  and  other  buyers  may  hinder  our  ability  toexpand our business.
The
 negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significantcosts and cause diversion of our 
management’s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:•
incurrence  or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities of or with respect to an acquired business, including liabilitiesthat were unknown at the time o
f acquisition;•
failure to recover acquisition premiums;•
unanticipated capit al expenditures;25

Table of Contents•
failure to maintain effective internal c ontrol over financial reporting;•
recording goodwill and other in tangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;•
fluctuations in quarte rly results;•
unanticipated acquisi tion-related expenses;•
failure to reali ze anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and•
difficulties in assi milating personnel, benefits, services and systems.Some
 or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. The businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated salesand profitability, and any
 difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and adversely affectour internal control ove
r financial reporting.We
 compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. If consolidation becomesmore
 prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase andlimit our ability to 
expand through acquisitions.Our 
Regulated  Businesses are  subject  to  condemnation  and  other  proceedings  through  eminent  domain  or  other  similar  authorized  process,  which  couldmaterially and adversely af
fect their results of operations and financial condition.Municipalities
 and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States,and
 organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated  Businesses operate  to convert our assets to publicownership
 and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain, or another similar authorized process. Should a municipality or othergovernment
 subdivision or a citizen group seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of acitizen petition, we m
ay resist the acquisition.Furthermore,
 the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated  Businesses operate,  including, for example, California, provide for eminent domainrights
 allowing  private  property  owners  to  seek  just  compensation  against  a  public  utility  if  the  public  utility’s  infrastructure  has  been  determined  to  be  asubstantial
 cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. These actions haveoccurred in connection with 
events such as floods, mudslides and debris flow, broken water mains, landslides and wild and brush fires.Contesting an
 exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedingsand
 may  divert  the  attention  of  management  of  affected Regulated  Businesses from  the  operation  of  those  businesses.  Moreover,  our  efforts  to  resist  thecondemnation, eminent domain or other process may not
 be successful, which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to paya
 private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered. If a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of oneor more of our 
Regulated Businesses through eminent  domain or other process, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, thatwe
 will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes mayhave a material adv
erse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.We
 rely on technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems couldadversely affect our business.
Our
 technology systems, particularly our operational technology and IT systems, are an integral part of our business, and any disruption of these systemscould
 significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer andadversely
 affect our results of operations. For example, we depend on these systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage certainplant
 operations and construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage humanresources,
 inventory and accounts receivable collections. These systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timelybasis, maintain cost-effective 
operations and provide service to our customers.Although
 we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure or cybersecurity incidents than other similar organizations, ouroperational technology and 
IT systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from:•
power loss, computer systems fa ilures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•
operator error or imp roper operation by, or the negligent or improper supervision of, employees and contractors;26

Table of Contents•
physical and electroni c loss of customer or employee data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•
computer viruses; •
intentional security b reaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data and similar events; and•
severe weather and other events, including without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other disasters.These
 events  may  result  in  physical  and  electronic  loss  of  customer,  employee  or  financial  data,  security  breaches,  misappropriation  and  other  adverseconsequences.
 In addition, a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of anyof
 these events on us. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and wemight
 lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our currentlevel of efficiency.
We may be subject to physical and/or c
yber attacks.As operators of
 critical infrastructure, we may face a heightened risk of physical and/or cyber attacks. Our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerableto
 disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Our operational technology and IT systems throughoutour
 businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes. Unauthorized access to confidentialinformation
 located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. While we haveinstituted certain safeguards to protect our operational technolo
gy and IT systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyberattacks and cyber vulner
abilities. We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.If,
 despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customerand
 other confidential information lost or stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; suffer a loss of management time,attention
 and resources from our regular business operations; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, and damage to our reputation, any of which couldhave
 a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, couldalso cause us to incur additional security
 and insurance related costs. Losses resulting from a physical or cyber attack against us or our operations or assets may notbe covered by, or may exceed 
the coverage provided by, applicable insurance policies.In
 addition,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  collect  and  retain  sensitive  information,  including  personally  identifiable  information,  about  ourcustomers
 and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss and/orfraudulent
 use  of  customer,  employee  or  proprietary  data  as  a  result  of  a  cyber  attack  could  subject  us  to  significant  litigation,  liability  and  costs,  as  well  asadversely impact our r
eputation with customers and regulators, among others.Our
 inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational technology and IT systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expectedcosts or otherwise adversely impac
t our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.Upgrades
 and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management’stime
 and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees’ability to effect
ively use the new or upgraded system. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and haveinstalled
 new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. These efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations andenhance
 our customer service capabilities. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems mayincrease
 costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control overfinancial
 reporting. We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve ourcustomers
 effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that allsuch impacts
 have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations, fin
ancial condition and cash flows.Our
 business has inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life, and be exposedto financial losses, including penalties and other l
iabilities.Our
 safety record is critical to our reputation. We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and thepublic. Although we intend to adhere 
to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries, it is extremely difficult to avoid accidents at all times.27

Table of ContentsOur
 business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, often put our employees, contractors and others in close proximity with large pieces ofequipment,
 moving vehicles, pressurized water, underground trenches and vaults, chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites we are responsible forsafety
 and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. If we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are notfollowed
 by our employees or others, our employees, contractors and others may be injured or die. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employeeturnover,
 expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact onour business, financial condi
tion, results of operations and cash flows.In
 addition, our operations can involve the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals, which, if improperly handled, stored or disposed of, could subjectus
 to  penalties  or  other  liabilities.  We  are  also  subject  to  regulations  dealing  with  occupational  health  and  safety.  Although  we  maintain  functional  employeegroups
 whose  primary  purpose  is  to  ensure  we  implement  effective  health,  safety,  and  environmental  work  procedures  throughout  our  organization,  includingconstruction sites and ma
intenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adv
ersely affect our results of operations.As of 
December  31, 2017 , approximately 46% of  our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 76 collective bargaining agreements in place with19 
different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, including 35 which expired in 2017 , and 20 which will expireduring 
2018 ,  are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. Moreover, our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions that represent employeesin
 our Regulated Businesses expires on July 31, 2018 and will be renegotiated during 2018. We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these laborcontracts
 on  terms  that  are  fair  to  us.  Any negotiations  or  dispute  resolution  processes  undertaken  in  connection  with  our  labor  contracts  could  be  delayed  oraffected by
 labor actions or work stoppages. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract termsduring
 renegotiations, may disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cashflows and
 liquidity. While we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur, a strike or work stoppagemay have a materia
l adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utiliz
e qualified personnel.The
 success  of our business is dependent upon our ability  to hire, retain,  and utilize  qualified  personnel, including engineers,  licensed  operators,  waterquality
 and other operating and craft personnel, and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. From time to time, it may bedifficult
 to  attract  and  retain  qualified  individuals  with  the  expertise  and  in  the  timeframe  demanded  for  our  business  needs.  In  certain  geographic  areas,  forexample, we may not be able 
to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.In
 addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implementsuch plans. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate successi
on plans, it could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, financial condit
ion, results of operations and cash flows.Financial and Market-Related Risks
Our indebtedness could affect
 our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generatesufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquid
ity needs.As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was$7.7
 billion ,  and  our  working  capital  (defined  as  current  assets  less  current  liabilities)  was  in  a  deficit  position.  Our  indebtedness  could  have  importantconsequences, including:
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;•
exposing us to interest rat e risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;•
limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;•
impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;•
requiring  that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, therebyreducing funds available 
for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;•
limiting  our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market orindustry conditions; and
•
placing us at a competi tive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.28

Table of ContentsIn
 order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new short-term
 and long-term  debt securities.  Moreover, additional  borrowings may be required  to refinance  outstanding indebtedness.  Debt maturities  and sinking fundpayments
 in 2018 , 2019 and 2020 will  be $322  million , $170 million and $51 million ,  respectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to accessthe
 debt capital markets on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify,limiting our ability 
to refinance existing debt on favorable terms.In an attempt to manag
e our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt, we have entered into, and in the futuremay
 enter  into,  financial  derivative  instruments,  including  without  limitation,  interest  rate  swaps,  forward  starting  swaps,  swaptions  and  U.S.  Treasury  lockagreements. See 
Item 7A—Quantitative and  Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . However,  these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest raterisk,
 and  may  expose  us  to  other  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  quarterly  “mark  to  market”  valuation  risk  associated  with  these  instruments,  that  couldnegatively and mater
ially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We
 will depend primarily on cash flows from operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt. Therefore, ourability
 to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic,competitive, legisl
ative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control. Ifwe
 do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt,reduce
 capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows fromoperations,
 or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in ourbusiness, which could cause our finan
cial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected adversely.Our
 inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability tomeet long-term commi
tments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.In
 addition to cash from operations, we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, and the capital markets to satisfy ourliquidity
 needs. In this regard, our principal external sources of short-term liquidity are our $1.6 billion commercial paper  program and our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility
 expires in accordance with its terms in June 2020. We regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolvingcredit
 facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market. Asof 
December 31, 2017 ,  American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), our wholly owned financing subsidiary, had no outstanding borrowings under the revolvingcredit
 facility, and had $905  million of  commercial paper outstanding and $84  million in  outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that AWCC willbe
 able  to  continue  to  access  its  commercial  paper  program  or  its  revolving  credit  facility,  when,  as  and  if  desired,  or  that  the  amount  of  capital  availablethereunder will be suffi
cient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.Under
 the terms of our revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the termsof the credit facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit, len
ders under the credit facility wouldbe entitled to
 refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable. To avoid such adefault, a waiver or ren
egotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that wouldrestrict our operational and
 financing flexibility.Our
 ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to variousrisks
 and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significantwrite-down
 of our goodwill. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm ourbusiness
 by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that wemay believe would be in our best 
interests or the interests of our stockholders to complete.29

Table of ContentsDisruptions
 in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all. While thelending
 banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, ordeterioration
 of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending theterms
 of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. These or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments, and wemay
 not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or debt markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain,renew or replace commitments
 under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations andliquidity.
 Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, including as a result of changes in U.S. tax and other laws, reducedfinancing
 alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. Any significantdisruption
 in the capital, debt or credit markets, or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes oruntil
 alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducingother discretionary exp
enditures.Any
 of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets, or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result fromfinancial market disruptions, could expose us to increased interest expense, req
uire us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materiallyaffect our business, finan
cial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.American
 Water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable topay upstream dividends or repay funds to American Water.
American
 Water is a holding company and, as such, American Water has no operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held bysubsidiaries.
 American Water’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income andcash flows of its subsidiaries and their
 ability to pay upstream dividends to American Water or repay indebtedness to American Water. Prior to paying dividends toAmerican
 Water, American Water’s regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including, for example,debt
 service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements, and covenants andother
 agreements made or entered into by American Water and its subsidiaries. American Water’s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation topay dividends
 to American Water. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a materialadverse impact on Ameri
can Water’s liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations.We may not be able to fully util
ize our U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards.As
 of December  31,  2017 ,  we  had  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOL  carryforwards  of  approximately $1.05  billion and $322  million ,  respectively,  andmanagement
 believes it is more likely than not that these NOL carryforwards will be recovered in the future. With the enactment of the TCJA, the Companyanalyzed the impacts o
f the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, includingits NOL carryforwards, and as a resu
lt, remeasured those NOL carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the TCJA based on this tax rate change.Our
 federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 ,  and our state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 through 2037. Our ability toutilize
 our NOL carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income. We have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain ofour
 state NOL carryforwards, and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our netincome.
Our
 actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the NOL carryforwards. Moreover,adoption of Related Interpretations with respect to the TCJ
A and other changes in income tax laws, the economy and the general business environment could affectthe
 future utilization  of our NOL carryforwards. If we are unable to fully utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future, ourfinancial position, resu
lts of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we ma
y never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that maynegatively affect our results o
f operations.Our
 total assets include $1.4 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2017 .  The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by anaffiliate
 of our previous owner in 2003 and the acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001, and, to a lesser extent, theacquisition of
 Keystone in 2015. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangibleassets
 acquired. Goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicatethe
 carrying value may not be recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, we have taken significant non-cash charges to operating results forgoodwill impairments in th
e past.30

Table of ContentsWe
 may  be  required  to  recognize  an  impairment  of  goodwill  in  the  future  due  to  market  conditions  or  other  factors  related  to  our  performance  or  theperformance
 of an acquired business. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time invaluation
 multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases incontrol premiums,
 or, with respect to Keystone, fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions served byKeystone, a
 prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our current or future forecasts of operating results, cash flows or keyassumptions.
 A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates,could
 also result in an impairment  charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairmentoccurred,
 which may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment could be materialand
 could  make  it  more  difficult  to  maintain  our  credit  ratings,  secure  financing  on  attractive  terms,  maintain  compliance  with  debt  covenants  and  meet  theexpectations of our regul
ators.Market
 conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which may require us toprovide significant additional funding.
The
 performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension andpostretirement
 benefit plans. The value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations, which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected returnrates.
 A  decline  in  the  market  value  of  the  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  plan  assets  can  increase  the  funding  requirements  under  our  pension  andpostretirement
 benefit plans. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. If interest rates decrease,our
 liabilities  would  increase,  potentially  increasing  benefit  expense  and  funding  requirements.  Further,  changes  in  demographics,  such  as  increases  in  lifeexpectancy assumptions and in
creasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements. Future increases in pension and other postretirementcosts
 as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negativelyaffected.
In
 addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans. Forexample,
 a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent thatmarket data
 compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect ourfinancial position, resu
lts of operations and cash flows.New
 accounting  standards  or  changes  to  existing  accounting  standards  could  materially  impact  how  we  report  our  results  of  operations,  cash  flow  andfinancial condition.
Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritativebodies
 or  governmental  entities  may  issue  new  pronouncements  or  new  interpretations  of  existing  accounting  standards  that  may  require  us  to  change  ouraccounting
 policies. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cashflow
 and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cashflow and financial condit
ion.Undetected errors in internal controls and information repor
ting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.Our
 internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions andinformation
 in  a  timely  and  accurate  manner  in  compliance  with  GAAP,  taxation  requirements,  federal  securities  laws  and  regulations  and  other  laws  andregulations
 applicable  to  us.  Such  compliance  permits  us  to,  among  other  things,  disclose  and  report  financial  and  other  information  in  connection  with  therecovery of our costs and with th
e reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations.We
 have implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002(the
 “Sarbanes-Oxley  Act”)  and  relevant  SEC  rules,  as  well  as  other  applicable  regulations.  Such  internal  controls  and  policies  have  been  and  continue  to  beclosely
 monitored  by  our  management  and  Board  of  Directors  to  ensure  continued  compliance  with  these  laws,  rules  and  regulations.  Management  is  alsoresponsible
 for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. Whilewe
 believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporarylapses in
 internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recoveryand
 noncompliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The
 inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls couldalso increase financ
ing costs or could also adversely affect our or AWCC’s ability to access the capital markets.31

Table of ContentsAdditional Risks Related to Our 
Market-Based Businesses We
 (excluding our regulated subsidiaries) provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our Market-Based  Businesses ,  includingfinancial
 guarantees or deposits, to our public-sector and public clients, and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our Market-Based Businesses do not satisfy these obligations.
Under
 the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities, other governmental entitiesand
 other  customers,  American  Water  (excluding  our  regulated  subsidiaries)  provides  guarantees  of  specified  performance  obligations  of  our Market-Based Businesses 
,  including  financial  guarantees  or  deposits.  In  the  event  our Market-Based  Businesses fail  to  perform  these  obligations,  the  entity  holding  theguarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit. In that event, our financial conditio
n, results of operations,cash flows, and liquidity could be 
adversely affected.At 
December 31, 2017 ,  we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately $3.6 billion , and this
 amount is likely to increase if our Market-Based  Businesses expand.  The presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition andmake it more difficult for us
 to secure financing on attractive terms.AWE’s operations are subject to various risks associated wi
th doing business with the U.S. government.We
 enter into contracts with the U.S. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be terminated,in
 whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiaryperforming the
 contract. In addition, the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement ofoperations and every three years thereafter.
 Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changesin
 contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. Any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financialcondition, results of opera
tions and cash flows.Moreover, entering
 into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the levelof
 government  spending  and  compliance  with  and  changes  in  governmental  procurement  and  security  regulations.  We  are  subject  to  potential  governmentinvestigations
 of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with theseregulations
 can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or barred from biddingon or receiving awards of new cont
racts with the U.S. government, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.AWE
 operates a number of water and wastewater systems under O&M contracts and faces the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capitalto properly maintain those systems, which may nega
tively affect AWE as the operator of the systems.AWE
 operates a number of water and wastewater systems under O&M contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, AWE operates the system according to thestandards
 set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements. In some cases,AWE
 may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. Although violations andfines
 incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts, those non-compliance events mayreflect
 poorly on AWE as the operator of the system and us, and damage our reputation, and in some cases, may result in liability to us to the same extent as if wewere the owner.
AWE’s 
Market-Based  Businesses are  party to long-term contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs inexcess of payments receiv
ed.Some
 of  AWE’s Market-Based  Businesses enter  into  long-term  contracts  under  which  they  agree  to  operate  and  maintain  a  municipality’s,  federalgovernment’s
 or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities, which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities, inexchange
 for an annual fee. These Market-Based  Businesses are  generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities,including
 production costs such as purchased water, electricity, fuel and chemicals used in water treatment, may exceed the fees received from the municipality orother contracting par
ty. Losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.32

Table of ContentsKeystone’s operations may expose us to substantial cos
ts and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters.Keystone’s
 operations,  and  the  operation  generally  of  natural  gas  and  oil  exploration  and  production  facilities  by  Keystone’s  customers,  are  subject  tostringent
 federal,  state  and  local  laws,  rules,  regulations  and  ordinances  governing  the  release  of  materials  into  the  environment  or  otherwise  relating  toenvironmental
 protection. These provisions may require the acquisition by Keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers, prohibit therelease
 of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities, and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may resultfrom
 these operations. Failure to comply with these laws, rules, regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs toKeystone,
 the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities. Under existingenvironmental
 laws  and  regulations,  Keystone  could  be  held  strictly  liable  for  the  removal  or  remediation  of  previously  released  materials  or  propertycontamination
 regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations, or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time theywere
 performed. While we have structured and maintained our ownership and control of Keystone’s operations in such a way that we believe should insulate theCompany,
 its  regulated  subsidiaries  and  its  other Market-Based  Businesses from  any  liabilities  associated  with  Keystone’s  operations,  including  liabilities  forenvironmental matters, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the Compan
y from incurring liability for the operations of Keystone.Changes
 in  environmental  laws  and  regulations  occur  frequently,  and  any  changes  to  these  or  other  laws  governing  the  natural  gas  and  oil  explorationindustry
 that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require Keystone to makesignificant
 expenditures  to  maintain  compliance  with such requirements,  may harm  Keystone’s  business and  results  of operations  by reducing  the demand  forKeystone’s
 water  and  related  services,  and  may  otherwise  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  Keystone’s  competitive  position,  financial  condition,  results  ofoperations and cash flows.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Dive
rsionsUnder the 2009 Order, Cal Am is
 required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to aset
 reduction schedule. The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of waterfrom
 the Carmel River as required  by a 1995 SWRCB order. In July 2016, at the request  of Cal Am and several  Monterey  County government  agencies,  theSWRCB
 issued the 2016 Order approving a five-year extension of the deadline to comply with the 2009 Order, to December 31, 2021. In November 2016, theWater
 Ratepayers Association of the Monterey Peninsula, a citizens’ advocacy group, filed an action in Sacramento County Superior Court against the SWRCBand
 its board members, and naming Cal Am as the real party in interest, seeking to reverse the extension of the 2009 Order, to rescind the designation by theCalifornia Public Utilit
ies Commission (the “CPUC”) of Cal Am as the public utility water provider to the Monterey Peninsula, and to appoint a receiver to overseeCal
 Am’s compliance with the 2009 Order, with ultimate transfer to a public entity. In May 2017, Cal Am and the SWRCB filed demurrers to the action, and onJune 12, 2017, the court entered an o
rder sustaining those demurrers and dismissing the action with prejudice.Regional Desalination Project Litigation
The
 Regional Desalination Project (the “RDP”) involved the construction of a desalination facility in the City of Marina, north of Monterey. The RDP wasintended
 to,  among  other  things,  eliminate  unauthorized  diversions  from  the  Carmel  River  as  required  under  the  2009  Order.  In  December  2010,  the  CPUCapproved
 the RDP, which was to be implemented  through a Water  Purchase  Agreement  and ancillary  agreements  (collectively,  the  “Agreements”)  among theMarina
 Coast  Water  District  (“MCWD”),  the  Monterey  County  Water  Resources  Agency  (“MCWRA”)  and  Cal  Am.  In  2011,  due  to  a  conflict  of  interestconcerning
 a  former  member  of  MCWRA’s  Board  of  Directors,  MCWRA  stated  that  the  Agreements  were  void,  and,  as  a  result,  Cal  Am  terminated  theAgreements. In
 April 2015, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among Cal Am, MCWRA and the County of Monterey to resolve these matters among theparties
 signing the agreement. In March 2016, the Supreme Court of California granted MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC approval, and following thecourt’s
 disposition of a related issue in another case, MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC-approved settlement agreement was remanded to the CPUC, andremains pending.
In
 October 2012, Cal Am filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief against MCWRA and MCWD, which was ultimately transferred to the San FranciscoCounty Superior Court, seeking a
 determination as to whether the Agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest. In June 2015, the court entereda
 final judgment agreeing with Cal Am’s position that four of the five Agreements are void, and one, the credit line agreement, is not void. In November 2016, theSupreme
 Court of California denied MCWD’s final appeal of this judgment, which allows further proceedings to determine the amount of damages that may beawarded in the proceeding.
In
 July  2015,  Cal  Am  and  MCWRA  filed  a  Complaint  in  San  Francisco  County  Superior  Court  against  MCWD  and  RMC  Water  and  Environment(“RMC”), a
 private engineering consulting firm, seeking to recover compensatory damages in excess of $10 million associated with the failure of the RDP, as wellas
 punitive and treble damages, statutory penalties and attorneys’ fees. Shortly thereafter, complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court byMCWD and RMC
 against Cal Am and MCWRA in excess of $19 million in the aggregate. In December 2015, the court consolidated all of these complaints into asingle
 action, and trial in this matter has been scheduled for June 18, 2018. On December 21, 2017, RMC filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and a hearing onsuch
 motion is scheduled for March 15, 2018. On December 6, 2017, MCWD filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and a hearing on such motion tookplace
 on February 2, 2018. On February 5, 2018, the court dismissed Cal Am’s and MCWRA’s tort law claims against MCWD, and allowed Cal Am leave toamend
 its  breach  of  contract  claims  against  MCWD.  The  court’s  decision  does  not  impact  Cal  Am’s  and  MCWRA’s  tort  claims  against  RMC.  Cal  Am  andMCWRA
 were  given  until  February  19,  2018  to  amend  their  breach  of  contract  claims.  Cal  Am  and  MCWRA  are  considering  their  responses  to  the  order,including an appeal to the Ca
lifornia Court of Appeal.Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
The
 Water Supply Project is intended to reduce water diversions from the Carmel River and involves construction of a desalination plant, owned by CalAm,
 and purchase of water by Cal Am from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution ControlAgency
 and the MPWMD. Cal Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUC and othergovernment
 agencies,  obtaining  necessary  permits,  and  intervention  from  other  parties.  On  January  12,  2017,  the  CPUC issued  a  Draft  Environmental  ImpactReport/Environmental Imp
act Statement. A final report is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2018.34

Table of ContentsOn
 September 15, 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Projectand
 to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $50 million in associated costs, subject to meeting certain criteria. If construction costsexceed $50 million, Cal Am would be a
llowed to seek additional cost recovery.A
 preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability ofthe
 property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under Monterey Bay. In November 2014, the California Coastal Commission (the “CoastalCommission”)
 approved coastal development permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well. The permits would haveexpired
 on February 28, 2018, at which time Cal Am would have been required to decommission the test slant well, but because Cal Am could use the test slantwell as one of the slant wells 
for the Water Supply Project, it sought an amendment of its coastal development permits to allow the test slant well to remain in placeand
 be maintained on site until February 28, 2019. The Coastal Commission approved the permit amendment on December 13, 2017. The required lease obtainedfrom
 the California State Lands Commission (the “State Lands Commission”), as amended, after a two-year extension granted on November 29, 2017, is to expireon December 16, 2019.
On
 July 13, 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property onwhich
 intake wells will be located to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit or governmental entity. The consent agreementstrictly
 limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights ofrecord.
The
 CPUC held hearings from October 25 through November 3, 2017 on Cal Am’s request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for theWater Supply Project. This requ
est remains pending.In December 2014, the MCWD and the Ag Land Trust, an agricult
ural land conservancy, filed petitions against the Coastal Commission and Cal Am, whichwere
 ultimately transferred to the Santa Cruz County Superior Court, seeking to vacate the Coastal Commission’s approval of the coastal development permit andto
 permanently  restrain  Cal Am and the Coastal Commission  from constructing  the test  slant well pending full compliance  with the California  EnvironmentalQuality
 Act and the California Coastal Act. The court denied these petitions, and on January 11, 2017, the Supreme Court of California denied MCWD’s petitionfor review of this decision. MCWD f
iled a similar petition in January 2015 against the State Lands Commission and Cal Am, which remains pending.In
 November 2015, MCWD filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Santa Cruz County Superior Courtagainst
 the Coastal Commission and Cal Am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test wellpumping.
 In September 2016, the court denied MCWD’s petition with respect to all claims, except claims related to those raised in the December 2014 petitionsdiscussed
 above. On October 3, 2017, after conducting a trial for all matters raised in MCWD’s November 2015 challenge, other than claims that had been deniedby
 the court in September 2016, the court denied MCWD’s claims with respect to these matters. On January 12, 2018, MCWD filed a notice of appeal of thecourt’s judgment.
Based
 on the foregoing, Cal Am estimates that the earliest date by which the Water Supply Project desalination plant could be completed is sometime in2021.
 There can be no assurance that Cal Am’s application for the Water Supply Project will be approved or that the Water Supply Project will be completed on atimely
 basis, if ever. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remainingrequirements
 under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to Cal Am or theCompany.
California Public Utilities Commiss
ion Residential Rate Design ProceedingIn
 December 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision in a proceeding involving Cal Am adopting a new residential rate design for Cal Am’s MontereyDistrict.
 The decision allowed for recovery by Cal Am of $32 million in under-collections in the water revenue adjustment mechanism/modified cost balancingaccount (“WRAM/MCBA”) over
 a five-year period, plus interest, and modified existing conservation and rationing plans. In its decision, the CPUC noted concernregarding Cal
 Am’s residential tariff administration, specifically regarding the lack of verification of customer-provided information about the number of residentsper
 household. This information was used for generating billing determinants under the tiered rate system. As a result, the CPUC kept this proceeding open toaddress several issues, inc
luding whether Cal Am’s residential tariff administration violated a statute, rule or CPUC decision, and if so, whether a penalty should beimposed.
On
 February  24,  2017,  Cal  Am,  the  MPWMD, the  CPUC’s Office  of  Ratepayer  Advocates,  and  the  Coalition  of  Peninsula  Businesses  filed  for  CPUCapproval
 of  a  joint  settlement  agreement  (the  “Joint  Settlement  Agreement”),  which  among  other  things,  proposed  to  resolve  the  CPUC’s  residential  tariffadministration
 concerns by providing for a waiver by Cal Am of $0.5 million of cost recovery for residential customers through the WRAM/MCBA in lieu of apenalty. Approval of the Joint Set
tlement Agreement, which is required for it to take effect, remains pending before the CPUC.35

Table of ContentsOn
 March  28,  2017,  the  administrative  law  judge  assigned  to  the  proceeding  issued  a  ruling  stating  there  was  sufficient  evidence  to  conclude,  on  apreliminary basis, tha
t Cal Am’s administration of the residential tariff violated certain provisions of the California Public Utilities Code and a CPUC decision. Theruling ordered
 Cal Am to show cause why it should not be penalized for these administrative violations and directed the settling parties to address whether the costrecovery
 waiver  in  the  Joint  Settlement  Agreement  was  reasonable  compared  to  a  potential  penalty  range  described  by  the  administrative  law  judge.  Duringhearings
 held on April 13-14, 2017, the administrative law judge clarified that this potential penalty range is $3 million to $179 million (calculated as a continuingviolation
 dating back to 2000 and applying penalties of up to $20,000 per day until January 1, 2012 and penalties of up to $50,000 per day thereafter, reflecting a2012 change to the relevant statute).
 The administrative law judge also noted that a per diem penalty may not be appropriate, as Cal Am’s monthly billing practicesdid
 not allow Cal Am to update customer-provided information for billing purposes on a daily basis. Hearings before the administrative law judge in this matterwere
 held in August, September and November 2017. Cal Am also submitted additional testimony on the issue of whether Cal Am should be penalized, and if so,the reasonable
 amount of any such penalty. This proceeding remains pending, and the CPUC has set a statutory deadline of September 30, 2018 for the completionof the proceeding.
West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill
Background
On
 January 9, 2014, a chemical storage tank owned by Freedom Industries, Inc. leaked two substances, 4-methylcyclohexane methanol (“MCHM”), andPPH/DiPP
H, a mix of polyglycol ethers, into the Elk River near the WVAWC treatment plant intake in Charleston, West Virginia. After having been alerted to theleak of MCHM by the West Virginia Depa
rtment of Environmental Protection, WVAWC took immediate steps to gather more information about MCHM, augmentits
 treatment process as a precaution, and begin consultations with federal, state and local public health officials. As soon as possible after it was determined thatthe augmented treatment
 process would not fully remove the MCHM, a joint decision was reached in consultation with the West Virginia Bureau for Public Healthto
 issue a “Do Not Use” order for all of its approximately 93,000 customer accounts in parts of nine West Virginia counties served by the Charleston treatmentplant. By January 18, 2014, none of WVAWC’s customers we
re subject to the Do Not Use order.Following the Freedom Industries ch
emical spill, numerous lawsuits were filed against WVAWC and certain other Company-affiliated entities (collectively,the
 “American Water Defendants”) with respect to this matter in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia or West Virginia Circuit Courtsin
 Kanawha,  Boone  and  Putnam  counties,  and  to  date,  more  than 70 cases  remain  pending.  Four  of  the  cases  pending  before  the  U.S.  district  court  wereconsolidated
 for purposes of discovery, and an amended consolidated class action complaint for those cases (the “Federal action”) was filed in December 2014 byseveral plaintiffs. In January 2016, all of the then-filed state court cases were referred to West Virginia’s Mass Litigatio
n Panel for further proceedings, which havebeen
 stayed until April 22, 2018 pending the approval by the court in the Federal action of a global agreement to settle all of such cases, as described below. Thecourt in the Federal ac
tion has continued the start of the trial indefinitely pending ongoing settlement approval activities.Proposed Global Class Action Settlement
In
 October 2016, the court in the Federal action approved the preliminary principles, terms and conditions of a binding global agreement in principle tosettle claims
 among the American Water Defendants, and all class members, putative class members, claimants and potential claimants, arising out of the FreedomIndustries chemical
 spill. On April 27, 2017, the parties filed with the court in the Federal action a proposed settlement agreement providing details of the terms ofthe
 settlement of these matters and requesting that the court in the Federal action grant preliminary approval of such settlement. On July 6, 2017, the court in theFederal
 action issued an opinion denying without prejudice the joint motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement. On August 25, 2017, the parties filed aproposed amended settlem
ent agreement and related materials addressing the matters set forth in the July 6, 2017 order.On
 September  21,  2017,  the  court  in  the  Federal  action  issued  an  order  granting  preliminary  approval  of  a  settlement  class  and  proposed  class  actionsettlement
 (the “Settlement”) with respect to claims against the American Water Defendants by all putative class members (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) for allclaims
 and potential claims arising out of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. The Settlement proposes a global resolution of all federal and state litigation andpotential claims
 against the American Water Defendants and their insurers. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement and the proposed amended settlementagreement,
 the American Water Defendants have not admitted, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the Plaintiffs in any ofthe actions to be resolved. Under federal class action rules, claimant
s had the right, until December 8, 2017, to elect to opt out of the final Settlement, in which casesuch
 claimant would not receive any benefit from or be bound by the terms of the Settlement. As of January 31, 2018, less than 100 of the 225,000 estimatedputative Plaintiffs hav
e submitted opt-out notices. The deadline to file a claim in the Settlement is February 21, 2018.36

Table of ContentsThe
 proposed aggregate pre-tax amount of the Settlement with respect to the Company is $ 126  million .  The aggregate portion of the Settlement to becontributed
 by WVAWC, net of insurance recoveries, is $ 43  million (approximately  $ 26  million after-tax),  taking into account the September 2017 settlementwith
 one of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers discussed below. Another defendant to the Settlement is to contribute up to $ 25  million to  theSettlement.
 Two of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers, which provide an aggregate of $ 50  million in  insurance coverage to the Company underthese
 policies, had been originally requested to participate in the Settlement at the time of the initial filing of the binding agreement in principle with the court inthe
 Federal action, but did not agree to do so at that time. WVAWC filed a lawsuit against one of these carriers alleging  that the carrier’s  failure  to agree toparticipate
 in the Settlement constituted a breach of contract. On September 19, 2017, the Company and the insurance carrier settled this lawsuit for $ 22 million , out
 of a maximum of $25 million in potential coverage under the terms of the relevant policy, in exchange for a full release by the Company and WVAWC of allclaims
 against the insurance carrier related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. WVAWC and the settling insurer have agreed to stay this litigation pendingfinal approval of the Set
tlement. The Company and WVAWC continue to pursue vigorously their rights to insurance coverage for contributions by WVAWC to theSettlement
 in mandatory arbitration with the remaining non-participating carrier. This arbitration proceeding remains pending. Despite these efforts, the Companymay not ultimately be
 successful in obtaining full or further reimbursement under this insurance policy for amounts that WVAWC may be required to contribute tothe Settlement.
The
 proposed Settlement would establish a two-tier settlement fund for the payment of claims, comprised of (i) a simple claim fund, which is also referredto
 as the “guaranteed fund,” of $ 76  million ,  of which $ 29  million will  be contributed by WVAWC, including insurance deductibles, and $ 47  million would be contributed by two of the Company’s gen
eral liability insurance carriers, and (ii) an individual review claim fund of up to $ 50 million , of which up to $ 14 million would
 be contributed by WVAWC and up to $ 36 million would  be contributed by a number of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers. Separately, upto
 $ 25 million would  be contributed to the guaranteed fund by another defendant to the Settlement. If any final approval order by the court in the Federal actionwith
 respect to the Settlement is appealed and such appeal would delay potential payment to claimants under the Settlement, WVAWC and the other defendant tothe Settlement
 will contribute up to $ 50 million and $ 25 million , respectively,  to the Settlement (not including, in the case of WVAWC, any contributions by theCompany’s
 general liability insurance carriers which would not be made until such time as a final, non-appealable order is issued) into an escrow account duringthe
 pendency of such appeals. For certain claims, WVAWC and the other defendant to the Settlement may, in lieu of these escrowed contributions, make advancepayments of such
 claims if agreed to by the parties. All administrative expenses of the Settlement and attorneys’ fees of class counsel related thereto would be paidfrom the funds designated to p
ay claims covered by the Settlement.As
 a result of these events, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a charge to earnings, net of insurance receivables, of $ 65  million ($ 39million 
after-tax).  Additionally, in the third quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a benefit of $ 22  million ($ 13 million after-tax)  as an additional insurancereceivable
 reflecting the settlement with the insurance carrier described above. The Company intends to fund WVAWC’s contributions to the Settlement throughexisting sources of liquidi
ty, although no contribution by WVAWC will be required unless and until the terms of the Settlement are finally approved by the court inthe
 Federal action. Furthermore, under the terms of the Settlement, WVAWC has agreed that it will not seek rate recovery from the PSC for approximately $ 4 million 
in direct response costs exp ensed in 2014 by WVAWC relating to the Freedom Industries chemical spill as well as for amounts paid by WVAWC under theSettlement.
The
 Company’s insurance policies operate under a layered structure where coverage is generally provided in the upper layers after claims have exhaustedlower layers
 of coverage. The $ 36 million to be  contributed by a number of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers to the individual review claim fund,as
 noted above, is from higher layers of the insurance structure than the insurance carrier that was requested, but presently has not agreed, to participate in theSettlement.
 Any  recovery  by  WVAWC  or  the  Company  from  the  remaining  non-participating  carrier  would  reimburse  WVAWC  for  its  contributions  to  theguaranteed fund.
Notice
 of the terms of the Settlement to members of the settlement class commenced on October 11, 2017. Following the notice period, on January 9, 2018,the
 court in the Federal action held a fairness hearing to consider final approval of the Settlement, which was continued on February 1, 2018 to address certainopen
 matters. At this hearing, the court in the Federal action indicated that it intended to enter an order approving the Settlement, and the parties submitted aproposed order to the court on Febru
ary 2, 2018.There
 can be no assurance that the Settlement will not be amended further or that the court will provide its final approval as to any agreement negotiatedbetween the parties reflecting
 the terms of the Settlement.The American Water Def
endants believe that WVAWC has responded appropriately to, and, other than through the Settlement, has no responsibility for, theFreedom
 Industries  chemical  spill,  and  that  the  American  Water  Defendants  have  valid,  meritorious  defenses  to  the  lawsuits.  Nevertheless,  WVAWC  and  theCompany
 are unable to predict the outcome of any lawsuit against the American Water Defendants brought or maintained by a claimant that has elected to opt outof
 the Settlement, and any such outcome or outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,liquidity and reputation.

Additionally,
 investigations were initiated with respect to the matter by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (the “CSB”), the U.S.Attorney’s
 Office  for  the  Southern  District  of  West  Virginia,  the  West  Virginia  Attorney  General,  and  the  PSC.  As  a  result  of  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Officeinvestigation,
 Freedom Industries and six former Freedom Industries employees (three of whom also were former owners of Freedom Industries), pled guilty toviolations
 of the federal Clean Water Act. The PSC issued an order on June 15, 2017 concluding its investigation without requiring WVAWC to take any furtheraction with respect to th
e matters covered by the general investigation.The
 CSB  is  an  independent  investigatory  agency  with  no  regulatory  mandate  or  ability  to  issue  fines  or  citations;  rather,  the  CSB  can  only  issuerecommendations
 for further action. In response to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, the CSB commenced an investigation shortly thereafter. In September2016,
 the CSB issued and adopted its investigation report in which it recommended that the Company conduct additional source water protection activities. OnApril
 4,  2017,  the  CSB  indicated  that  the  implementation  by  the  Company  of  source  water  protection  activities  resolved  the  first  two  parts  of  the  CSB’srecommendation.
 The  CSB  also  noted  that  compliance  by  the  Company  with  the  third  part  of  its  recommendation  is  ongoing  and  that  closure  of  this  part  iscontingent
 upon completion of updated contingency planning for the Company’s water utilities outside of West Virginia. In light of public response to its originalSeptember
 2016 investigation report, on May 11, 2017, the CSB issued a new version of this report. The primary substantive change addressed CSB’s factualevaluation
 of the duration and volume of contamination from the leaking tank, decreasing its estimate of the leak time but increasing the volume estimate by 10%.No substantive changes were made 
to the conclusions and recommendations in the original report.On
 March  16,  2017,  the  Lincoln  County  (West  Virginia)  Commission  (the  “LCC”)  passed  a  county  ordinance  entitled  the  “Lincoln  County,  WVComprehensive
 Public Nuisance Investigation and Abatement Ordinance.” The ordinance establishes a mechanism that Lincoln County believes will allow it topursue
 criminal or civil proceedings for the “public nuisance” it alleges was caused by the Freedom Industries chemical spill. On April 20, 2017, the LCC filed acomplaint
 in  Lincoln  County  state  court  against  WVAWC  and  certain  other  defendants  not  affiliated  with  the  Company,  alleging  that  the  Freedom  Industrieschemical
 spill  caused  a  public  nuisance  in  Lincoln  County.  The  complaint  seeks  an  injunction  against  WVAWC  that  would  require  the  creation  of  variousdatabases and
 public repositories of documents related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, as well as further study and risk assessments regarding the allegedexposure
 of Lincoln County residents to the released chemicals. On June 12, 2017, the Mass Litigation Panel entered an order granting a motion to transfer thiscase
 to its jurisdiction and stayed the case consistent with the existing stay order. The LCC has elected to opt out of the Settlement. On January 26, 2018, the LCCfiled
 a motion seeking to lift the stay imposed by the Mass Litigation Panel. This motion is pending. WVAWC believes that this lawsuit is without merit andintends to vigorously contest th
e claims and allegations raised in the complaint.WVAWC
 and the Company are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing government investigations or actions or any legislative initiatives that mightaffect WVAWC’s water util
ity operations.Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On
 the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part ofWVAWC’s
 West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure to up to approximately25,000
 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,2015,
 a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20%by
 the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  wasreconfigured
 to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fullyrestored on July 1, 2015 to all custo
mers affected by this event.On
 June 2, 2017, a class action complaint was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County against WVAWC on behalf of a purported class ofresidents
 and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC forfailure
 to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenanceand operation of
 the water system. The plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss ofuse, as well as punitive damag
es for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.The Company
 and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint. On October 12, 2017,WVAWC
 filed with the court a motion seeking to dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ counts alleging statutory and common law tort claims. Furthermore, WVAWCasserts
 that the PSC, and not the court, has primary jurisdiction over allegations involving violations of the applicable tariff, the public utility code and relatedrules. This motion remains p
ending.38

Table of ContentsContract Operations Group -- East Palo Alto Water Syst
em Voluntary ReportOn
 April 10, 2017, AWE, the parent entity of the Company’s Contract Operations Group, voluntarily reported to the Division of Drinking Water of theSWRCB potential violations of
 the California Safe Drinking Water Act (the “CSDWA”) in connection with AWE’s operation of the City of East Palo Alto’s waterdistribution
 system.  Upon  the  resignation  of  the  system’s  general  manager  in  March  2017,  AWE  discovered  that  it  may  have  operated  the  system  without  aproperly
 certified operator for two years, the triennial LCR sampling was not completed, and the 2015 Consumer Confidence Report improperly reported data forlead
 and copper samples from the system’s upstream water provider. Promptly after discovering these issues, AWE engaged an outside law firm to conduct aninternal investigat
ion and has reported the results of that investigation to the SWRCB.On
 June 15, 2017, the SWRCB issued to AWE a citation that required AWE to, among other things: comply with regulations related to water operatorcertifications,
 lead and copper tap sampling requirements and the publishing of a Consumer Confidence Report; provide public notification of the LCR violation;and
 prepare  a  corrective  action  plan  to  evaluate  the  causes  leading  to  these  incidents  and  measures  to  be  taken  to  prevent  recurrence  of  future  incidents.  Thecitation did not impose on AWE any 
monetary penalties, but the SWRCB reserved the right to take additional enforcement action.By
 letter  dated  October  4, 2017, the SWRCB advised  AWE that it is in compliance  with all of the directives  and relevant  statutory  and administrativeprovisions specified in the SWRCB’
s June 15, 2017 citation. While AWE has completed all required compliance activities with respect to the citation, the SWRCBhas
 previously reserved the right to take additional enforcement action. In February 2018, the SWRCB referred this matter to the San Mateo County, CaliforniaDistrict
 Attorney’s office for further investigation. AWE continues to cooperate with the SWRCB, the City of East Palo Alto and the San Mateo County DistrictAttorney regarding this ma
tter. Proven violations of the CSDWA may result in civil and criminal penalties.General

 February  2015, our Board of Directors  authorized  an anti-dilutive  common stock repurchase  program to mitigate  the dilutive  effect  of shares issuedthrough
 our dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows us to purchase up to 10 million shares ofour
 outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is conducted inaccordance
 with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and to facilitate these repurchases, we enter into Rule 10b5-1 share repurchase plans with a third party broker,which
 allow us to repurchase shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed tradingblackout
 periods. Subject to applicable  regulations,  we may elect  to amend or cancel  the program or share repurchase  parameters  at our discretion  to managedilution.
From
 April  1,  2015,  the  date  repurchases  under  the  anti-dilutive  stock  repurchase  program  commenced,  through December  31,  2017 ,  the  Companyrepurchased an aggregat
e of 3,950,000 shares of common  stock under the program, including 700,000 shares repurchased during  the first half of 2017 . There were no repurchases of common stock 
in the last half of 2017 . 40

Overview
American
 Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured byboth
 operating revenues and population served. We employ approximately 6,900 professionals  who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related servicesto
 an estimated 15 million people in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada. Our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that providewater
 and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers, collectively presented as our “Regulated Businesses 
.” Our  utilities operate in 16 states and serve approximately 3.4 million customers,  based on the number of active service connections to ourwater
 and  wastewater  networks.  Our Regulated  Businesses are  generally  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  certain  state  utility  commissions  or  other  entitiesengaged in utility regul
ation, collectively referred to as PUCs. We also operate market-based businesses within four operating segments, providing a broad range ofrelated
 and  complementary  water  and  wastewater  services  to  military  bases,  municipalities,  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production  companies,  as  well  ascommercial,
 industrial and residential customers. Individually, these four operating  segments do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance withgenerally
 accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented as our Market-Based Businesses ,  which is consistent withhow management assesses the r
esults of these businesses.2017 
Financial Results The following table provides high
lights of our diluted earnings per share and our adjusted diluted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure):

Table of ContentsFor
 the year ended December 31, 2017 ,  net income attributable to common stockholders was $2.38 per diluted  share, a decrease of $0.24 per diluted share, or 
9.2% ,  as c ompared  to the prior year. Included  in the 2017 amount  was: (i) an after-tax benefit of $13  million ,  or $0.07 per  diluted share, resulting from aninsurance
 settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill; (ii) an after-tax charge of $4  million , or $(0.02) 
per  diluted share, resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company; and (iii) a non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge of $125 million 
, or $0.70 per  diluted share, resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the Company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment ofthe
 TCJA on December 22, 2017. Included in the 2016 amounts was an after-tax charge of $39  million ,  or $(0.22) per  diluted share, resulting from the bindingglobal
 agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the Freedom Industries chemical spill. For additional information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—West Virginia Elk River Freedo
m Industries Chemical Spill.Excluding
 these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) was $3.03 for  the year ended December  31, 2017 ,  an increase of $0.19 per
 diluted share, or 6.7% ,  as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to continued growth in our Regulated  Businesses ,  largely driven byinfrastructure
 investment,  acquisitions  and  organic  growth,  combined  with  growth  in  our Market-Based  Businesses from  our  Homeowner  Services  Group  andKeystone 
.  These increases  were partially offset by lower water services demand in 2017 in  our Regulated  Businesses ,  attributable in part to overall warmerweather
 in 2016, as well as lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group. For further discussion of our consolidated results of operations, as well asfinancial
 results for our Regulated  Businesses segment  and our Market-Based  Businesses ,  see “Consolidated Results of Operations” and “Segment Results ofOperations” for additiona
l information.Adjusted
 diluted earnings per share represents a non-GAAP financial measure and means diluted earnings per share, calculated in accordance with GAAP,excluding
 the impact of: (i) the third quarter of 2017 insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill; (ii) the early extinguishment of debt atthe
 parent company in the third quarter of 2017; (iii) the non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the impact of thechange
 in the federal tax rate on the Company’s deferred income taxes from enactment of the TCJA; a nd (iv) the  fourth quarter of 2016 binding global agreementin principle to settl
e claims related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful information byexcluding certain ma
tters that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and that providing this non-GAAP measure will allow investors to understandbetter our businesses’ operating performance and facilitate a meaningful year-to-year comparison of our results of operations. Altho
ugh management uses this non-GAAP
 financial measure internally to evaluate our results of operations, we do not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined byGAAP,
 and  the  reader  should  not  consider  them  as  indicators  of  performance.  This  non-GAAP  financial  measure  is  derived  from  our  consolidated  financialinformation
 but is  not  presented  in  our  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP, and thus  it  should be  considered  in  addition  to,  and  not as  asubstitute
 for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure as defined and used abovemay not be comparable to s
imilarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, it may have significant limitations on its use.Strategic Focus and 
2017 Achievements We
 believe our success in the future will be driven by engaged employees, smart investments and safe, efficient operations, leading to satisfied customerswhich in turn
 will lead to constructive regulatory outcomes and sustainable financial performance. Our strategy, which is driven by our vision and core values, willcontinue to be anchored on our f
ive central themes:•
Customer—Our  customers are at the center of everything we do. We want to be the best, and if our customers have a choice as to who serves them,we want it to be us.
•
In 2017 , we: •
achieved both a customer s atisfaction rating and a service quality rating in the top quartile among our water industry peers;•
expanded  our customer experience initiative, designed to make it easier for customers to do business with us, and enhanced our qualityof service through imple
mentation and upgrades of technology tools; and•
continued  to make needed infrastructure investment while implementing operational efficiency improvements to keep customer ratesaffordable.
•
Looking forward, we will: •
target the achievement  of customer satisfaction and service quality targets in the top quartile of service industries, beyond the water andwastewater
 industry.  We  have  a  three  year  plan  to  enhance  technology  and  innovation  in  our  customer  experience  through:  (i)leveraging
 secure artificial intelligence to better serve our customers; (ii) using on-line customer communities for immediate input andreactions
 before rolling out programs; and (iii) mapping our most frequent customer interactions and re-working our internal processesto how the customer wants servic
es; and43

aim  for top quartile targets for drinking water quality and being an industry leader in system resiliency and environmental stewardship.We intend to continue t
o make needed infrastructure investments while implementing operational efficiency improvements to help keepcustomer rates affordable.
•
Safety—Safety is both a stra tegy and a value at American Water. We put safety first in everything that we do.•
In 2017 , we: •
finished  the year with fewer employee injuries than the prior year and exceeded our targeted results for our Occupational Safety andHealth Administration re
cordable incident rate and our Days Away Restricted or Transferred rate; and•
strengthened  our safety culture as measured by employee responses to safety-related questions in the Company’s culture survey, andscored
 13  points  above  “High  Performing  Companies”  in  the  category  of  safety,  as  measured  by  CEB,  Inc.  Our  safety  council,consisting
 of  management  and  labor  employees  from  across  the  Company,  continued  its  mission  of  developing  and  implementingrecommendations to re
inforce the Company’s commitment to safety.•
Looking forward, we will: •
strive toward zero workplac e injuries;•
focus  on  requiring  that  the  contractors  that  perform  work  for  the  Company  are  approved  in  accordance  with  the  Contractor  SafetyQualification Practi
ce and are held to the same standards as our employees; and•
continue our focus on “near m iss reporting,” to promote continuous learning and corrective action regarding potential safety hazards.•
People—We  are  building  a  diverse,  fully-engaged,  high  performance  workforce  and  culture  and  creating  an  environment  where  our  people  feelvalued, included and account
able.•
In 2017 ,  we continued to demonstrate our commitment to employees by expanding training and development across the Company, with thevast
 majority of our employees completing at least 20 hours of training during 2017. We also added new Respect and Diversity training tostrengthen our values-based 
culture.•
Looking forward, we will continue to: •
improve the diversity of ou r overall employee population, reflective of our customers and communities;•
implement  a strategic workforce plan which will address the changing requirements of our business and our jobs, and how we will fillthose critical posit
ions throughout the Company to promote continuity and help us to meet future operational needs; and•
dedicate ourselves to pe rsonal development through effective training and development plans.•
Growth—We  expect to continue to grow our businesses, with the significant majority of our growth to be achieved in our Regulated  Businessesthrough: (i)
 continued investment in infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers; and(ii)
 regulated  acquisitions  to  expand  our  services  to  new  customers.  We  also  expect  to  continue  to  grow  our Market-Based  Businesses ,  whichleverage our core water an
d wastewater competencies.•
In 2017 ,  we invested $1.7  billion ,  a record level of annual investment since the Company went public in 2008, and $200 million more than2016 
, which had previously been a reco rd year for investment. Our 2017 investment included:•
$1.4 billion , of which the majority was in our Regulated Businesses for infrastructure replacements an d improvements; and•
$210  million to  fund acquisitions in our Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 40,000 water  and wastewater customers,including bulk customers, highl
ighted by the:•
April 3, 2017 acquisition of Shorelands Wa ter Company, Inc. (“Shorelands”) in a stock transaction for $33 million in the form of 438,211 
shares  of our common stock. Shorelands, which is now a part of our New Jersey subsidiary, provides water service toapproximately 
11,000 customers in Monmouth County, New Jersey; and the44

December  18, 2017 acquisition  of the McKeesport system for $159  million .  This acquisition was the first acquisition executedunder
 Pennsylvania’s Act 12 of 2016, which allows municipalities to sell water and wastewater systems for a price based uponthe
 fair  market  value  of  the  system.  Under  Act  12,  the  rate  base  for  this  acquisition  was  approved  at $158  million .  TheMcKeesport
 system, which is now part of our Pennsylvania subsidiary, represents approximately 22,000 customers; comprised of 
11,000 customer connections, as wel l as service to an additional 11,000 customers under bulk contra cts to 13 municipalities inAllegheny County, Pennsylvania.
•
On  September 29, 2017, our Military Services Group was awarded a contract for ownership, operation and maintenance of the waterand
 wastewater systems at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the largest single-site employer in the state of Ohio. The contract awardincludes
 estimated revenues of approximately $490 million over a 50-year period, subject to an annual economic price adjustment. Inthe
 fourth quarter  of 2017, a bid protest was filed on this contract  by an unsuccessful  bidder. In January 2018, the bid protest wassustained
 because a required element of the solicitation was not properly considered. The protester’s bid proposal will be re-evaluated,and we believe that the con
tract previously awarded to our Military Services Group will be reinstated.•
Looking  forward, we expect to invest between $8.0  billion to $8.6 billion from  2018 to 2022, including a range of $1.6  billion to $1.8 billionin 
2018 . Our expected future invest ment includes:•
capital  investment for infrastructure improvements in our Regulated  Businesses of $7.2 billion over  the next five years, including arange of 
$1.4 billion to $1.5 billion expected in 2018 ; •
growth  from acquisitions in our Regulated  Businesses to  expand our water and wastewater customer base of between $600  million to $1.2 billion 
over the next five years, including a range of $120 million to $240 million expected in 2018 ; and •
strategic capital  investments of approximately $200 million over  the next five years, including approximately $100 million expected in 2018 
.  These  investments  include  strategic  growth  opportunities  in  our Market-Based  Businesses and  the  construction  of  our  newcorporate headquarters in
 Camden, New Jersey, which is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018 and is eligible for upto 
$164 million in tax credits from New Jers ey’s Economic Development Authority.The

Technology  and Operational Efficiency—We continue to strive for industry-leading operational efficiency, driven by technology. Our technologyinvestments are aimed at enha
ncing our customer experience and operational efficiency.•
In 2017 : •
our Regulated  Businesses achieved  an  adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  (a  non-GAAP  measure)  of 33.8% for  the  year  endedDecember
 31, 2017 ,  compared to 34.9% and 35.9% for  the years ended December  31, 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively. The continuedimprovement in
 our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio in 2017 was attributable to both an increase in operating revenues and a decrease inO&M
 expenses  (see  the  following  table).  The  improvement  in  the 2016 adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  over  the 2015 ratio  wasprimarily attributable to an increa
se in operating revenues;•
we  introduced  new  tools  such  as  FSR Customer  One  View,  which  provides  our  employees  with  information  such  as  neighborhoodmaps, customer usage data, billing and payment history, and real-time meter reads; and MapCall, which helps to manage location based
assets such
 as hydrants, valves, meters, among others; along with implementing technology upgrades to our national customer services,focused on helping us improve custo
mer service;•
we  continued our commitment to water quality and the environment by leveraging new technologies; we now have advanced waterquality sensors at all of ou
r major drinking water intake sites and we are automating our reporting and compliance systems; and•
we implemented other t echnology tools that will enhance communication, collaboration and mobility to help our operations and supportemployees work more 
safely and efficiently, and enhance the customer experience.•
Looking forward, we will focus on technology and efficiency to:•
be  the leader in optimizing technology deployment across the water and wastewater industry, with a keen focus on specific, innovativeprojects
 that will set us apart from other utilities, and to help us serve our customers with greater ease, make us safer and help us operatemore efficiently; and
•
achieve our goal of an adjus ted O&M efficiency ratio equal to or below 32.0% by 2022. Our
 adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  is  defined  as  our  regulated  operation  and  maintenance  expenses  divided  by  our  regulated  operatingrevenues, where
 both operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Additionally,from
 operation and maintenance expenses, we have excluded the allocable portion of non-operation and maintenance support services costs, mainlydepreciation
 and general taxes, that are reflected in our Regulated  Businesses segment  as operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidatedfinancial reporting purposes, are categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statement
s of Operations. For the years endedDecember
 31, 2017 and 2016 ,  we have also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses the impact of certain Freedom Industries chemicalspill settlement activities. We excl
uded all of the above items from the calculation as we believe such items are not reflective of management’s abilityto
 increase efficiency of our regulated operations. Going forward, we expect changes to our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio related to the impact ofthe enactment of the TCJA and th
e adoption of new accounting standards in the future.We evaluate our operating performance using this ratio because we believe it directly measures improvement in the efficiency of our regulated
operations.
 This information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance. Our adjusted O&M efficiencyratio
 is not a GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures, and should not be used in place of theGAAP information provided elsewhere in 
this Form 10-K.With
 respect  to  our  adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  goal  for  2022,  we  are  unable  to  provide  without  unreasonable  efforts  a  quantitativereconciliation
 of each component of this ratio to the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. In calculating thecomponents
 of the ratio, certain items that may ultimately be excluded would be reflective of events that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.The
 unavailable  information  would include,  among other  things, the impact  of items currently  excluded from  the calculation  of the components,adjustments
 for  weather  conditions  that  exceed  a  certain  threshold  of  variability  and  adjustments  for  events  or  circumstances  that  may  not  bereflective of ongoing ope
rating results. The probable significance of these items is also presently unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated.46

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On 
December 22, 2017 ,  the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Codeof 1986,
 including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January  1, 2018, and certain other provisions relatedspecifically
 to  the  public  utility  industry,  including  continuation  of  interest  expense  deductibility,  the  exclusion  from  utilizing  bonus  depreciation  and  thenormalization
 of deferred income tax. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017 results
 of  operations  and  financial  position.  The  portion  of  this  re-measurement  related  to  our Regulated  Businesses was  substantially  offset  by  a  regulatoryliability,
 as we believe it is probable that the deferred income tax excesses created by the TCJA will be refunded to customers in future rates. The remainingportion
 of this re-measurement of the net deferred income tax liability was recorded as a non-cash charge to earnings of $125  million during  the fourth quarter of2017.
Other Tax Matters
On
 April 11, 2017, the state of New York enacted legislation that increased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to New York. Thislegislation
 eliminated the production of water as a qualified manufacturing activity in New York, which effectively increased the state income tax rate in NewYork.
 As a result of the legislative change, we were required to re-measure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the higher state income tax rate inthe
 second quarter of 2017. This change in legislation was the primary cause of an increase to our unitary deferred income tax liability of $11 million. The portionof
 this increase related to our New York subsidiary calculated on a stand-alone basis was $7 million, and was offset by a regulatory asset, as we believe it isprobable
 of recovery in future rates. The remaining increase in the deferred income tax liability was calculated through state tax apportionment rates and recordedat the consolidated lev
el, resulting in a non-cash, cumulative charge to earnings of $4 million during the second quarter of 2017.On July 7,
 2017, the State of Illinois enacted legislation that increased, effective July 1, 2017, the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable toIllinois
 from 7.75% to 9.5%. As a result of the legislative change, we were required to re-measure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the higherstate
 income tax rate in the third quarter of 2017. This change in legislation was the primary cause of an increase to our unitary deferred income tax liability of $7million.
 The portion of this increase related to our Illinois subsidiary calculated on a stand-alone basis was $4 million, and was offset by a regulatory asset, as webelieve
 it is probable of recovery in future rates. The remaining increase in the deferred income tax liability was recorded at the consolidated level, resulting in anon-cash, cumulative cha
rge to earnings of $3 million during the third quarter of 2017.50

In 
2017 , operating revenues increased $55 million , or 1.7% , primarily due to a: •
$87  million increase in  our Regulated  Businesses principally  due to authorized rate increases to fund infrastructure investment growth, as well asacquisitions
 and organic growth, offset in part by lower water services demand in 2017, including a $15 million reduction due to warmer weather in2016; partially offset by a
•
$29 million decrease in our Market-Based Businesses mainly due to lower capital upgrades in our  Military Services Group, driven largely by reducedmilitary
 base budgets, offset in part by incremental revenues in our Homeowner Services Group from contract growth and price increases, and inKeystone from an increase 
in operations as a result of market recovery in the natural gas industry.In 
2016 , operating revenues increased $143 million , or 4.5% , primarily due to a: •
$128  million increase in  our Regulated  Businesses principally  due to authorized rate increases to fund infrastructure investment growth, as well asacquisitions and organic growth
; and a•
$17 million increase in our Market-Based Businesses mainly due to our acquisit ion of Keystone in the third quarter of 2015 and incremental revenuesfrom
 our  Homeowner  Services  and  Contract  Operations  Groups  from  contract  growth,  partially  offset  by  lower  capital  upgrades  in  our  MilitaryServices Group.
Operation and Maintenance
In 
2017 , operation and maintenan ce expense decreased $126 million , or 8.4% , primarily due to a: •
$85  million decrease in  our Regulated  Businesses principally  due to a $65 million net charge recorded in 2016, resulting from the binding globalagreement
 in principle to settle claims associated with the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia, and a $22 million benefit recorded in2017, resulting from a rel
ated insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers; and a51

Table of Contents•
$35  million decrease in  our Market-Based  Businesses mainly  due to  lower  capital  upgrades  in  our  Military  Services  Group,  as discussed  above,partially
 offset by higher employee-related costs from growth in Keystone and increased customer uncollectible expense in Homeowner Servicesfrom contract growth during 2017.
In 
2016 , operation and maintenan ce expense increased $100 million , or 7.1% , primarily due to a: •
$81  million increase in  our Regulated  Businesses principally  due  to  a  $65  million  charge  recorded  in  2016,  resulting  from  the  binding  globalagreement
 in principle to settle claims associated with the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia, as well as higher employee-relatedcosts and litigation expens
es, partially offset by lower casualty insurance and customer uncollectible expense; and an•
$14  million increase in  our Market-Based  Businesses which  included $11 million from our acquisition of Keystone in the third quarter of 2015, aswell
 as  incremental  costs  associated  with  growth  in  our  Homeowner  Services  and  Contract  Operations  Group,  partially  offset  by  lower  capitalupgrades in our Military Serv
ices Group, as discussed above.Depreciation and Amortization
In 
2017 and 2016 ,  depreciation and amortization expense increased $22  million and $30 million ,  or 4.7% and 6.8% ,  respectively. The increase for bothperiods
 was primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service. Included in 2017 was  the impact of revised depreciation rates from a depreciation studyapproved
 by  the  ICC  in  our  Illinois  subsidiary,  resulting  in  lower  depreciation  expense  of $16  million .  Included  in 2016 was  incremental  depreciation  andamortization expense 
resulting from our acquisition of Keystone in the third quarter of 2015.General Taxes
In 
2017 and 2016 ,  general  taxes increased $1  million and $15 million ,  or 0.4% and 6.2% ,  respectively.  The  increase  in 2016 was  primarily  due  toincremental proper
ty and gross receipts taxes in our Regulated Businesses . Gain on Asset Dispositions and Purchases
In 
2017 and 2016 , gain  on asset dispositions and purchases increased $6 million and $7 million , or 60.0% and 233.3% , respectively.  The increase in 2017 was primarily due
 to a $7 million gain recognized on a land sale in our Kentucky subsidiary. The increase in 2016 was largely  attributable to a gains recognized ona land sale in our Pennsylvania subs
idiary and an acquisition in our Missouri subsidiary.Other Income (Expense)
In 
2017 and 2016 ,  other expenses increased $22  million and $17 million ,  or 7.1% and 5.8% ,  respectively. The increase in 2017 was  primarily due to anincrease
 in interest expense from the issuance of incremental long-term debt in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as a $6  million charge  resulting fromthe
 early extinguishment  of debt at the parent company.  The increase  in 2016 was  largely  attributable  to an increase  in interest  expense  from  the issuance  ofincremental
 long-term debt, as well as an increase in short-term interest expense, mainly due to higher levels of short-term borrowings during 2016, coupled withan increase in the ave
rage short-term borrowing rates in 2016, as compared to the prior year.Provision for Income Taxes
In 
2017 ,  our provision for income taxes increased by $184 million ,  or 60.9% ,  from the previous year. The increase is primarily due to higher pretaxincome
 and  a  non-cash,  after-tax  re-measurement  charge  of $125  million ,  resulting  from  the  impact  of  the  change  in  the  federal  tax  rate  on  the  Company’sdeferred income taxes from the enactment of the TCJA, which included a reduction in the maximum U.S
. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% . The $125 million 
charge includes $6 million allocated to our Regulated Businesses segment, $5 million to our Market-Based Businesses and $114 million to our Other segment. In 
2016 ,  our provision for income taxes decreased $4 million , or 1.3% ,  from the previous year. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income. The effec
tive tax rates were 53.3% , 39.2%  and 39.1% for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  we’ve recognized federal NOL carryforwards of $1.05  billion .  The TCJA eliminated the bonus depreciation deduction forproperty
 acquired or constructed after September 27, 2017, and we currently expect to utilize the benefits of our federal NOL carryforwards over the next twoyears. See 
Note 13—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements for additional information.52

Table of ContentsSegment Results of Operations
Our
 segments  are  determined  based  on  how  we  assess  performance  and  allocate  resources.  We  evaluate  the  performance  of  our  segments  and  allocateresources
 based on several factors, with the primary measure being net income attributable to common stockholders. The majority of our business is conductedthrough
 our Regulated  Businesses reportable  segment. We also operate several market-based businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementarywater
 and wastewater services within four operating  segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP. Thesefour 
,  non-reportable  operating  segments  are  collectively  presented  as  our Market-Based  Businesses ,  which  is  consistent  with  how  management  assesses  theresults of these businesses.

The correlation between water revenues and billed  water volumes shown in the preceding tables is impacted by the California drought. In 2015, and to a lesser extent in 2016, Californiaexperienced
 a severe drought. In April 2015, the Governor mandated water usage restrictions to reduce overall water usage by 25% in the state compared to 2013 levels. In April 2017,the
 mandated water usage restrictions were removed. In California, revenue is decoupled from sales volume through the WRAM/MCBA, aligning our water conservation goals withthose of the state and our customers, and therefore usage reductions do not impact earnings.
In 
2017 , operating revenues increased $87 million , or 3.0% , primarily due to a: •
$81 million increase f rom authorized rate increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund investment growth in various states;•
$43 million increase a ttributable to water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems; and a•
$9 million increase resultin g from higher wastewater treatment volumes and an increase in private fire service connections; partially offset by a•
$48 million decrease due to lower water services demand, including a $15 million reduction due to warmer weather in 2016.In 
2016 , operating revenues increased $128 million , or 4.7% , primarily due to a: •
$92 million increase f rom authorized rate increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund investment growth in various states;•
$19 million increase a ttributable to water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems;•
$4 million increase resultin g from higher wastewater treatment volumes and an increase in private fire service connections; and•
$13  million  increase  mainly  due  to  revenues  from  balancing  accounts,  primarily  in  our  California  subsidiary,  as  well  as  surcharges  and  otheradjustments.

We
 regularly  evaluate  and  monitor  our  cash  requirements  for  capital  investments,  acquisitions,  operations,  commitments,  debt  maturities,  interest  anddividends.
 Our business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. When necessary, we also obtain funds fromexternal sources, primarily in the
 debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. We also have access to equity capital markets, if needed. Ouraccess
 to  external  financing  on  reasonable  terms  depends  on  our  credit  ratings  and  current  business  conditions,  including  that  of  the  utility  and  water  utilityindustries
 in  general,  as  well  as  conditions  in  the  debt  or  equity  capital  markets,  and  the  national  and  international  economic  and  geopolitical  arenas.  If  thesebusiness,
 market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer are able to access the capital markets on reasonable terms, we haveaccess to an unsecured revo
lving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of $1.75 billion , with an expiration date of Jun e 2020 (subject to extension by usfor
 up to two one-year periods). We rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our short-term liquidity needs, to issue letters of creditand
 to  support  our $1.6  billion commercial  paper  program.  Disruptions  in  the  credit  markets  may  discourage  lenders  from  extending  the  terms  of  suchcommitments
 or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets. See “CreditFacilities and Short-Ter
m Debt” for further discussion.58

Table of ContentsIn order to
 meet our short-term liquidity needs, we, through AWCC, our wholly owned financing subsidiary, issue commercial paper, which is supported bythe
 revolving credit facility. As of December  31, 2017 ,  AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $84 million of  outstanding letters of credit under its revolvingcredit
 facility,  with $1.75  billion available  to  fulfill  our  short-term  liquidity  needs  and  to  issue  letters  of  credit,  which  supported $905  million in  outstandingcommercial paper. We believe
 that our ability to access the capital markets, our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficientcash
 to fund our short-term requirements. We have no plans to issue equity under normal operating conditions in the foreseeable future with the limited exceptionof
 privately or investor-owned acquisitions whose sellers require equity as necessary to complete the acquisition. We believe we have sufficient liquidity and theability to manage our exp
enditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, we can provide no assurances that the lenders will meettheir
 existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future onterms acceptable 
to us or at all.In
 addition, our regulated subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund constructionnecessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are refun
dable for limited periods, which vary according to state regulations, as new customersbegin
 to  receive  service  or  other  contractual  obligations  are  fulfilled.  Amounts  which  are  no  longer  refundable  are  reclassified  to  contributions  in  aid  ofconstruction.
 Utility  plant  funded  by  advances  and  contributions  is  excluded  from  our Regulated  Businesses rate  base.  Generally,  we  depreciate  contributedproperty
 and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property. Some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributedproperty,
 based upon regulatory  guidelines. The taxability of advances and contributions in aid of construction  was changed with the enactment of the TCJA.Previously,
 the majority of advances and contributions that we collected were not taxable however, with the enactment of the TCJA, they will be taxable goingforward.
 Regulatory treatment for advances and contributions under the TCJA has not yet been defined and we are working with our regulatory jurisdictions todetermine impacts 
to the Company and our customers.We
 use our capital resources, including cash, primarily to: (i) fund operating and capital requirements; (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities; (iii) paydividends;
 (iv) fund acquisitions; and (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations. We invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projectswhere
 we  expect  to  earn  a  long-term  return  on  investment.  Additionally,  we  operate  in  rate  regulated  environments  in  which  the  amount  of  new  investmentrecovery
 may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatorylag.
 See Item  1—Business — Regulated Businesses — Economic Regulation and Rate Making .  We expect to fund future maturities of long-term debt through acombination of
 external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greaterthan our cash flows from opera
ting activities, we have no plans to reduce debt significantly. If necessary, we may delay certain capital investments or other fundingrequirements,
 or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, we believe we can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet ourobligations and fund our minimu
m required capital investments for an extended period of time.With the enactment o
f the TCJA and the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we anticipate a decrease in futurerevenue authorizations 
associated with our Regulated Businesses , initially leading to lower cash flows. We expect this cash flow impact to decline over time, asour 
Regulated Businesses ’ rate base grows, the resul t of lower deferred income tax liabilities, which offset rate base. The lower deferred income tax liabilities aremainly due to: (i) a lo
wer U.S. federal corporate income tax rate; (ii) the normalization (refunding to customers) of the re-measured deferred income tax liabilitiesover the remaining li
fe of the associated assets; and (iii) the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects that began after September 27, 2017.Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities
Cash
 flows  provided  by  operating  activities  primarily  result  from  the  sale  of  water  and  wastewater  services  and, due  to the  seasonality  of  demand,  aregenerally
 greater  during  the  warmer  months.  Our  future  cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities  will  be  affected  by,  among  other  things:  economic  utilityregulation;
 inflation;  compliance  with  environmental,  health  and  safety  standards;  production  costs;  customer  growth;  declining  customer  usage  of  water;employee-related 
costs, including pension funding; weather and seasonality; taxes; and overall economic conditions.We
 expect that the enactment of the TCJA to be accretive to our consolidated earnings over time through: (i) growth in rate base for the same level ofexpected
 capital expenditures due to the impact of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the re-measurement of our deferred income tax assets andliabilities;
 (ii) increased earnings in our Market-Based Businesses due  to the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate; all partially offset by (iii) the impact ofincreased debt due to lower cash flows from operation
s. We believe that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019, when we expectour
 federal NOL carryforwards balance will be fully benefited or used, and expect to be a full cash taxpayer by 2020, although this timing could be impacted byany significant changes in ou
r future results of operations and the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the TCJA.59

Table of ContentsCash
 flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of funding, sufficient to meet operating requirements, make our dividendpayments
 and  fund  a  portion  of  our  capital  expenditure  requirements.  We  expect  to  seek  access  to  debt  capital  markets  to  meet  the  balance  of  our  capitalexpenditure
 requirements as needed. We also have access to equity capital markets, if needed. Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in ourrate
 regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner. As such, our working capital needsare
 primarily  limited  to  funding  increases  in  customer  accounts  receivable  and  unbilled  revenues,  mainly  associated  with  revenue  increases  in  our Regulated Businesses 
.  We  can provide  no  assurance  that  our customers’  historical  payment  pattern  will  continue  in  the  future.  Sometimes  our current  liabilities  exceedcurrent
 assets because of our debt due within one year and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term
 debt, as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business, stage of our acquisitions and construction projects. Weaddress cash timing diff
erences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms.The following table provides a su

Changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, accounts payable and accrued l iabilities, and other current assets and liabilities, net.In 
2017 ,  cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities increased $160  million ,  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  net  income  after  non-cash  adjustments,including
 the impact of the enactment of the TCJA, and an increase in cash flows from working capital. The main factors contributing to the net income increaseare
 described in the “Consolidated Results of Operations” section and include higher operating revenues, partially offset by higher income taxes due to a $125 million 
re-measurement  charge resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the Company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of theTCJA. The increase in non-cash act
ivities was mainly attributable to the increase in deferred income taxes, as mentioned above, and an increase in depreciation andamortization
 due to additional utility plant placed in service. The change in working capital was principally due to: (i) the timing of accounts payable and accruedliabilities,
 including  the  accrual  recorded  during  2016  for  the  binding  global  agreement  in  principle  to  settle  claims  associated  with  the  Freedom  Industrieschemical
 spill in West Virginia; (ii) a decrease in unbilled revenues as a result of our Military Services Group achieving significant capital project milestonesduring
 2016;  and  (iii)  a  change  in  other  current  assets  and  liabilities,  including  the  decrease  in  other  current  assets  associated  with  the  termination  ofour four forward starting swap ag
reements and timing of payments clearing our cash accounts.In 
2016 ,  cash flows provided by operations increased $94  million ,  primarily due to an increase in net income after non-cash adjustments, including theimpact of
 the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia, and an increase in cashflows from working capital. The main
 factors contributing to the net income increase are described in the “Consolidated Results of Operations” section and includehigher
 operating revenues, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. The increase in non-cash activities was mainly attributable to an increase in depreciation andamortization due to
 additional utility plant placed in service. The change in working capital was principally due to: (i) a change in accounts receivable and unbilledrevenues
 resulting  from  continuous  improvement  in  our Regulated  Businesses ’  collection  efforts,  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  unbilled  revenues  in  our  MilitaryServices
 Group attributable to lower capital upgrades in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015; (ii) the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities;and (iii) a change in oth
er current assets and liabilities.The
 Company  expects  to  make  pension  and  postretirement  contributions  to  the  plan  trusts  up  to $45  million in 2018 .  In  addition,  we  estimate  thatcontributions
 will amount to $47  million , $47 million , $51 million and $58 million in 2019 , 2020 , 2021 and 2022 ,  respectively. Actual amounts contributedcould change materia
lly from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.60

2017 ,  our capital expenditures increased $123  million ,  or 9.4% ,  primarily due to investment in our general structure and equipment and wastewatercategories. In 
2016 , our capital expenditur es increased $151 million , or 13.0% , principally due to invest ment across the majority of our infrastructure categories. We
 also  grow  our  business  through  acquisitions  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  as  well  as  other  water-related  services.  These  acquisitions  arecomplementary
 to  our  existing  business  and  support  continued  geographical  diversification  and  growth  of  our  operations.  Generally,  acquisitions  are  fundedinitially with short-t
erm debt, and later refinanced with the proceeds from long-term debt.The following provides a summary o
f the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities:2017 
: •
The  majority of cash paid for acquisitions pertained to the $159  million purchase  of the McKeesport system, excluding a $5  million non-escrowed deposit made in 
2016 . •

 in our Regulated  Businesses .  In 2018 ,  we expect to invest between $1.6  billion to $1.8 billion ,  with a range of $1.4  billion to $1.5 billion for infrastructure
 improvements  in  our Regulated  Businesses .  Also  in 2018 ,  we  expect  to  invest  between $120  million to $240  million for  acquisitions  in  ourRegulated

 New Jersey, which is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018 and is eligible for tax credits from New Jersey’s Economic DevelopmentAuthority.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Our
 financing  activities,  primarily  focused  on  funding  infrastructure  construction  expenditures,  include  the  issuance  of  long-term  and  short-term  debt,primarily
 through AWCC. In addition, new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds, whichamounted to 
$28 million , $16 million and $26 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Based  on the needs of our Regulated Businesses 
and the  Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings tothe 
Regulated Businesses and the  parent company. The Regulated Businesses and  the parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principaland interest
 to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. The parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capitalfor the 
Regulated Businesses , therefore, the  parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. Asof 
December 31, 2017 ,  AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to our Regulated Businesses amounting to $3.9 billion and $586million 
,  respectively. Additionally, as of December  31, 2017 ,  AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the parent companyamounting 
$1.6 billion and $319 million , respectively. On 
August 10, 2017 ,  AWCC completed a $1.35  billion debt  offering which included the sale of $600  million aggregate  principal amount of its 2.95% Senior Notes
 due 2027, and $750 million aggregate principal  amount of its 3.75% Senior  Notes due in 2047. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, afterdeduction
 of  underwriting  discounts  and  debt  issuance  costs, $1.33  billion .  On September  13,  2017, AWCC used  proceeds  from  the  offering  to prepay $138 million 
of  its outstanding 5.62% Series  C Senior Notes due December 21, 2018 (“Series C Senior Notes”) and $181  million of  its outstanding 5.77% Series  DSenior
 Notes due December 21, 2021 (“Series D Senior Notes”). AWCC also used the proceeds of this offering to repay commercial paper obligations and forgeneral corporate purpos
es, and subsequently, on October 15, 2017, to repay at maturity, $524 million of its 6.085% Senior Notes. As
 a result of AWCC’s prepayment of the Series C Senior Notes and the Series D Senior Notes, and payment of a make-whole premium amount to theholders
 thereof of $34  million ,  we recorded a $6  million charge  resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company. Substantially all of theearly
 debt extinguishment costs allocable to the Regulated  Businesses were  recorded as regulatory assets for we believe they are probable of recovery in futurerates. Approximately 
$1 million of the early debt extingu ishment costs allocable to the Regulated Businesses were amortized in 2017. One
 of  the  principal  market  risks  to  which  the  Company  is  exposed  is  changes  in  interest  rates.  In  order  to  manage  the  exposure,  we  follow  riskmanagement policies
 and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. We reduce exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paperand
 debt maturities. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered intoare
 for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meettheir
 contractual  obligations.  We  minimize  the  counterparty  credit  risk  on  these  transactions  by  only  dealing  with  leading,  credit-worthy  financial  institutions,having long-term credi
t ratings of “A” or better.On 
August 7, 2017 ,  coinciding with AWCC’s $1.35 billion debt  offering, we terminated four existing  forward starting swap agreements with an aggregatenotional
 amount of $300  million ,  realizing a gain of $19  million to  be amortized through interest, net, over 30 years. On February 8, 2017, and December 11,2017,
 we entered into forward starting swap agreements, each with notional amounts of $100  million ,  to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to beissued in 2018. These
 forward starting swap agreements terminate in November 2018, and have an average fixed rate of 2.59% . We have designated these forwardstarting
 swap agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. Upon termination, the cumulativegain or loss recorded in ac
cumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net, over the term of the new debt.62

Table of ContentsIn
 October  2017,  we  terminated  our  interest-rate  swap  to  hedge $100  million of  its 6.085% Senior  Notes  maturing  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017.  TheCompany paid variable
 interest of six-month LIBOR plus 3.422% , and had  designated this interest rate swap as a fair value hedge, accounted for at fair value withgains
 or losses, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged item, recognized in interest, net. The net gain and loss recognized by the Company was deminimis for the periods 
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 . In
 May 2015, the parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC, a universal shelf registration statement that enables us to meet our capital needs throughthe
 offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including American Water common stock, preferred stock,and
 other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and as applicable,rating
 status. The shelf registration will expire in May 2018. During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , $1.35 billion , $550 million and $550 million ,  respectively, of debtsecurities were issued pursu

Includes $2 million of non-cash redemptions resulting from the use of restricted funds. From
 time to time and as market conditions warrant, we may engage in long-term debt retirements through tender offers, open market repurchases or otherviable alternatives to strengt
hen our balance sheets.In
 February 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive, common stock repurchase program to mitigate the effect of shares issued through ourdividend
 reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the Company to purchase up to 10  million shares of its
 outstanding common stock, over an unrestricted period of time, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is conducted inaccordance
 with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and to facilitate the repurchases, we have also entered into Rule 10b5-1 share repurchase plans with a third-party
 broker, which allows us to repurchase shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed
 trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations, we may elect to amend or cancel this repurchase program or the share repurchase parametersat our discretion. As of 
December 31, 2017 , we have repurchased an aggreg ate of 3,950,000 shares of common stock under th is program.64

Table of ContentsCredit Facilities and Short-Term Debt
We
 have  an  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility  of $1.75  billion that  expires  in  June  2020.  In  March  2016,  and  under  the  terms  of  the  revolving  creditagreement
 dated  June  30,  2015,  AWCC  exercised  its  right  to  increase  its  borrowing  capacity  available  under  our  revolving  credit  facility  from  the  aggregatemaximum of
 $1.25 billion, to $1.75 billion .  All other terms, conditions and covenants with respect to the existing facility remained unchanged. On June 30, 2015,AWCC
 and its lenders extended the termination date of the revolving credit facility from October 2018, to June 2020. This amended and restated agreement alsoallowed
 AWCC to request to extend further the term of the credit facility for up to two one-year periods. An extension request must satisfy certain conditions andreceive approval of the len
ders, as set forth in the revolving credit agreement.Interest
 rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the Eurodollar rate or base rate in accordance with AWCC’s then-applicableMoody
 Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services credit rating. At current ratings, that spread would be 0.90%. The facility is used principally tosupport AWCC’s commercial pape
r program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credi t. Indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposesof
 a  support  agreement  between  the  Company  and  AWCC,  which  serves  as  a  functional  equivalent  of  a  guarantee  by  the  Company  of  AWCC’s  paymentobligations under the cred
it facility.AWCC
 also has an outstanding commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility, the maximum aggregate outstanding amount ofwhich was increased on March 22, 2016, fro
m $1.0 billion to $1.6 billion . Keystone
 has its own line of credit facility with a maximum availability of up to $12  million ,  the actual amount of which is determined pursuant to acollateral
 base calculation. Borrowings under this facility are payable upon demand with interest being paid monthly. Interest accrues each day at a rate per annumequal
 to 2.75% above the greater of the one month or one day LIBOR. The borrowing base under the facility allows for financing up to the greater of the note or80%
 of eligible accounts receivable. Based on the collateral assets at December 31, 2017, $7 million was  available to borrow. At December  31, 2017 , there were no 
outstanding borrowings.The
 following table summarizes information regarding the Company’s aggregate credit facility commitments, letter of credit sub-limits and available fundsunder
 those  revolving  credit  facilities,  as  well  as  outstanding  amounts  of  commercial  paper  and  outstanding  borrowings  under  the  respective  facilities  as  ofDecember 31, 2017

l structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in the current portion of long-term debt.Debt Covenants
Our
 debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that we are not in compliance with these covenants, an event of defaultmay
 occur under one or more debt agreements and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access our revolvingcredit
 facility. Our long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt securedby the Company’s assets, subject to 
certain exceptions. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.65

Table of ContentsCovenants
 in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (asdefined in
 the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2017 , our ratio was 0.59 to 1.00 and  therefore we were in compliance with thecovenants.
Security Ratings
Our
 access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by oursecurities
 ratings.  We  primarily  access  the  debt  capital  markets,  including  the  commercial  paper  market,  through  AWCC.  However,  we  have  also  issued  debtthrough our regulated subsidia
ries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower our overall cost of debt.The following table presents ou
r long-term and short-term credit rating and rating outlook as of February 20, 2018 : Securities

 Rating Outlook
Negative  Stable Senior unsecured debt
A3  A Commercial paper
P-2  A-1 On
 January  19,  2018,  Moody’s  Investors  Service  changed  the  rating  outlooks  to  negative,  from  stable,  for  24  regulated  utilities  and  utility  holdingcompanies, including the Company
, all of which were primarily impacted by enactment of the TCJA. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or holdsecurities
 and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any otherrating. Security
 ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans. Wecan
 provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings. None of our borrowings are subject to default orprepayment as a result o
f the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility.As
 part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, chemicals and other services. Thesecontracts
 either  contain express provisions or otherwise permit  us and our counterparties  to demand adequate  assurance  of future performance  when there arereasonable
 grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if suchdowngrade
 is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand foradequate
 assurance  of  future  performance,  which  could  include  a  demand  that  we  provide  collateral  to  secure  our  obligations.  We  do  not  expect  to  post  anycollateral which will h
ave a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Dividends
Our
 Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to having access to sufficientsources
 of liquidity, the net income and cash flows of our subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and repayments of indebtedness from our subsidiaries, compliancewith Delaware
 corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements, and other factors. The Company’s dividend rateon
 its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible futuredevelopments
 that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days priorto the distribution date. Sin
ce the dividends on our common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.During 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  we paid $289  million , $261 million and $239 million in  cash dividends, respectively. The following table summarizes theper share cash dividends paid 
for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :

Table of ContentsRegulatory Restrictions
The
 issuance by the Company or AWCC of long-term debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge ofthe
 regulated subsidiaries is utilized. However, state PUC authorization is required to issue long-term debt at most of our regulated subsidiaries. Our regulatedsubsidiaries
 normally  obtain the required  approvals on a periodic  basis to cover their anticipated  financing  needs for a period of time or in connection  with aspecific financing.
Under
 applicable law, our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at a subsidiarymay
 limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us. Furthermore, the ability of our subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness toAmerican
 Water is subject to compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including, for example, debt service and preferred andpreference
 stock  dividends,  as  well  as  applicable  corporate,  tax  and  other  laws  and  regulations,  and  other  agreements  or  covenants  made  or  entered  into  byAmerican Water and i
ts subsidiaries.Insurance Coverage
We
 carry various property, casualty and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industrystandards.
 However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. Additionally, annual policy renewals can beimpacted
 by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going forward basis. We are self-insured to the extent that losses arewithin
 the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material  adverse effect on our short-term and long-termfinancial condition and ou
r results of operations and cash flows.Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We
 enter  into  contractual  obligations  with  third  parties  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Information  related  to  our  contractual  obligations  as  ofDecember 31, 2017

Table of ContentsPublic-Private
Partnerships
WVAWC
 has  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  various  public  entities,  which  we  refer  to  as  the  Partners,  to  establish  certain  joint  ventures,commonly
 referred to as “public-private partnerships.” Under the public-private partnerships, WVAWC constructed utility plant, financed by WVAWC, and thePartners
 constructed  utility  plant  (connected  to  WVAWC’s  property),  financed  by  the  Partners.  WVAWC  agreed  to  transfer  and  convey  some  of  its  real  andpersonal
 property  to  the  Partners  in  exchange  for  an  equal  principal  amount  of  Industrial  Development  Bonds,  commonly  referred  to  as  IDBs,  issued  by  thePartners
 under a state Industrial Development Bond and Commercial Development Act. WVAWC leased back the total facilities, including portions funded byboth WVAWC and the Partners, under leas
es for a period of 40 years.The
 leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the IDBs. These payments are considered “PILOT payments” whichrepresent
 payments that WVAWC otherwise would pay as property taxes on the properties. We have presented the transaction on a net basis in the ConsolidatedFinancial
 Statements. The carrying value of the transferred facilities, which is presented in property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, wasapproximately 
$150 million as of December 31, 2017 . Performance
Obligations
We
 have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the United States military, municipalities and othercustomers.
 These military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2068 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remainingcontract
 revenues of $3.6  billion as  of December  31, 2017 .  The operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between2018
 and 2038 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of $711  million as  of December  31, 2017 . Some
 of the Company’s long-term contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s, federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment anddelivery facilities include resp
onsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities, in exchange for an annual fee.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of finan
cial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions andjudgments
 that  could  significantly  affect  a  company’s  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Management  believes  that  the  areas  describedbelow
 require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and thatmay change
 in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significantimpact
 on  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows,  as  reflected  in  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Management  has  reviewed  thecritical
 accounting polices described below with our audit committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additionaldiscussion
 regarding  these  critical  accounting  policies  and  their  application  can  be  found  in Note  2—Significant  Accounting  Policies in  the  Notes  to  theConsolidated Financial State
ments for additional information.Rate Regulation and Regulatory Accounting
Our regulated utilities are subject to economic regulation by PUCs and, as suc
h, we follow the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulatedutilities,
 which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of this authoritative guidance is applicable toutility
 operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates will be set torecover
 the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December  31, 2017 ,  we concluded that the operations of ourutilities met the criteria.
Application of this authori
tative guidance has a further effect on our financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. Wemake
 significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assetsand
 liabilities  related  to  regulated  acquisitions,  pension  and  postretirement  benefits,  depreciation  rates  and  taxes.  Due  to  timing  and  other  differences  in  thecollection
 of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an non-regulated entity, to bedeferred
 as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatoryliability
 for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable tocustomers. Regulators may a
lso impose certain fines or penalties.68

Table of ContentsFor
 each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business, we assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets and liabilitiescontinue to
 meet the criteria for probable, future recovery or settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatoryenvironments;
 recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pendingor
 potential legislation that could impact the ability to recover costs through regulated rates. If subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities nolonger
 meet the criteria for probable, future recovery or settlement, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected.In
 addition,  if  we  conclude  in  a  future  period  that  a  separable  portion  of  the  business  no  longer  meets  the  criteria,  we  are  required  to  eliminate  the  financialstatement effec
ts of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recordedin the Consolidated Financial St
atements. Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.On 
December 22, 2017 ,  the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Codeof
 1986, including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as  of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significantexcess
 deferred income taxes that the Company and its regulatory jurisdictions believe should be refunded to customers. As such, we recorded these amounts asregulatory
 liabilities.  The  PUCs  in  our  regulatory  jurisdictions  have  opened  formal  proceedings  related  to  the  TCJA  and  we  have  begun  working  with  ourregulators
 on options to provide the income tax savings to our customers, and to address customer rate impacts and cash flow impacts for the Company. Theoutcome of these proceed
ings will likely take some time and could vary by regulatory jurisdiction.As
 of December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  our regulatory asset balance was $1.1  billion and $1.3 billion ,  respectively, and our regulatory liability balance was$1.7
 billion and $403  million ,  respectively.  See Note  6—Regulatory  Assets  and  Liabilities in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  furtherinformation regarding our
 significant regulatory assets and liabilities.Goodwill
As of 
December  31, 2017 and 2016 , our  goodwill balance was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion ,  respectively. Under GAAP, goodwill must be allocated at thereporting
 unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and evaluated for impairment minimally, once a year. We perform an annualreview
 for impairment of goodwill as of November  30 of  each year, or more frequently if we determine that changes in circumstances or a triggering event thatwould more
 likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, has occurred. Adverse industry or economic trends, lower projectionsof
 profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization, among other things, may be indicators of potential goodwill impairment issues, requiring thetesting of the carrying 
value for recoverability.Entities
 evaluating goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment isnecessary.
 In performing a qualitative assessment, we assess and makes judgments, among other things, around macroeconomic conditions, industry and marketconditions,
 overall  financial  performance,  cost  factors  and  entity  specific  events.  These  factors  require  significant  judgment  and  estimates,  and  application  ofalternative assumpt
ions could produce significantly different results. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is morelikely than not,
 greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment, or performs the qualitative assessmentbut determines that
 the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a two-step, quantitative fair value assessment is performed.The
 first step of a quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value, including goodwill, onthe
 measurement date. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value, then the second step of the quantitativeassessment is performed 
to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any, for such reporting unit.The
 second step of a quantitative assessment requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, using purchaseprice allocation a
ccounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value forthe reporting unit, an imp
airment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. Application of goodwill impairment testing requiressignificant management judgment, including the identification of
 reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit. We estimate fair value using acombination of a discounted cash
 flow analysis and market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include, but are not limitedto,
 forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates, working capital, weighted average cost of capital and projectedterminal values. 
Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.69

Table of ContentsAt 
November  30 , 2017 ,  we completed qualitative  assessments for our Regulated Businesses, Military Services Group and Contract Operations Groupreporting
 units, and determined that no qualitative factors were present that would indicate the estimated fair values of these reporting units were less than theirrespective carrying values. As such, we
 determined that the two-step, quantitative fair value assessment was not necessary for these reporting units as of November 30 
, 2017 . At 
November 30 , 2017 ,  we completed step one of the two-step, quantitative assessment for our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone reporting units,and
 concluded there were no impairments to their respective goodwill carry values. We used an income approach valuation technique which estimates discountedfuture cash flows from oper
ations, which relies on a single scenario reflecting the best estimate of projected cash flows. The estimated fair value of the HomeownerServices Group
 reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 156% .  The estimated fair value of the Keystone reporting unit exceeded its carrying valueby
 approximately 11% .  If  further  decline  in  the  fair  value  were  to  occur,  the  Keystone  reporting  unit  would  be  at  risk  of  failing  step  one  of  the  two-step,quantitative
 assessment. Additional  discussion  regarding  our  goodwill  can  be  found  in Note  7—Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets in  the  Notes  to  theConsolidated Financial State
ments.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
 assets  include  land,  buildings,  equipment  and  long-term  investments.  Other  than  land  and  long-term  investments,  our  long-lived  assets  aredepreciated
 over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not berecoverable.
 Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market value of the long-lived asset, a change in the asset’s expecteduseful
 life or physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the manner inwhich the asset
 is being used or is planned to be used. When such events or changes occur, we estimate the fair value of the long-lived asset from future cash flowsexpected
 to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, and compare it to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of thelong-lived
 asset is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value. Key variables thatmust
 be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operating costs, labor and other benefit costs, capital additions, assumed discount rates andother
 economic factors. These variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties, since they are forecasting future events. Avariation
 in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of a long-lived asset and, thus, could have a significant effect onour Consolidated Financial Stat
ements.The long-lived
 assets of our regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide operations thatdo
 not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of thatasset
 is no longer probable. The fair values of our long-term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which weinvest, as
 well as volatility inherent in the external markets, all of which are factors that we consider when assessing the potential impairment of these investments.If
 such long-term investments are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the investment’s carrying value exceeds itsfair value.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue
 for our regulated utilities is recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and includes amounts billed to customers on acycle
 basis, and unbilled amounts which are based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of theaccounting
 period. Increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the periodcould
 be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customersscheduled
 for  each  meter  reading  date  would  also  have  an  effect  on  the  unbilled  revenue  calculation.  Unbilled  revenue  for  our  regulated  utilities  as  ofDecember 31, 2017 
and 2016 was $152 million and $161 million , respectively. Revenues
 of  the Market-Based  Businesses are  recognized  as  services  are  rendered.  For  certain  construction  contracts,  revenue  is  recognized  over  thecontract
 term based on a calculated ratio that compares the costs incurred to date during the period to the total estimated costs for the entire contract. Losses oncontracts
 are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings onconstruction contracts
 are recorded as unbilled revenue. Billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilitieson
 the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions tocosts
 and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Unbilled revenue for our Market-Based  Businesses as  of December  31,2017 
and 2016 was $60 million and $102 million , respectively. 70

Table of ContentsAccounting for Income Taxes
Significant
 management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken,as well as deferred tax 
assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.In
 accordance  with  applicable  authoritative  guidance,  we account  for uncertain  income  tax positions  using a benefit  recognition  model  with a two-stepapproach,
 including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%likely
 of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, nobenefit
 is  recorded.  Uncertain  tax  positions  that  relate  only  to  timing  of  when  an  item  is  included  on  a  tax  return  are  considered  to  have  met  the  recognitionthreshold.
 Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will beexamined
 by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition thresholdhas been met and, if so, the app
ropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.We
 evaluate  the  probability  of  realizing  deferred  tax  assets  quarterly  by  reviewing  a  forecast  of  future  taxable  income  and  our  intent  and  ability  toimplement
 tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form ofcarryforwards,
 for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. We record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when weconclude it is more-l
ikely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.Under
 GAAP, specifically Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, Income Taxes the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognizedin
 the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply whentemporary differen
ces are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment, the Company’s deferred taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. Forour
 regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to refund to customers. Forour unregulated operations, 
the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings.The staff of the
 SEC has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of changes in tax law, more specifically the TCJA, and on December 22, 2017,issued
 guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) which clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available orcomplete
 and  provides  for  up  to  a  one  year  period  in  which  to  complete  the  required  analyses  and  accounting.  SAB 118  describes  three  scenarios  or  bucketsassociated
 with a company’s status of accounting for the TCJA:(1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company isable
 to  determine  a  reasonable  estimate  for  certain  effects  of  tax  reform  and  records  that  estimate  as  a  provisional  amount,  or  (3)  a  company  is  not  able  todetermine
 a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply ASC 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to theTCJA
 being enacted. The significant assumptions considered and evaluated by the Company relating to our accounting for the TCJA, include, but are not limitedto, the:
•
recording  of regulatory liabilities from the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred income taxes, and the uncertainty of regulatory treatment inour various jurisdictions in whi
ch the Company currently operates;•
allocation of inter est deductibility at the parent to our subsidiaries;•
bonus depreciation deductions for assets constructed and placed in service during the period September 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017; and•
normalization periods for our re-measured deferred taxes.Actual
 income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecastedfinancial
 condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for ourRegulated
 Businesses ,  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. While we believe the resulting tax balances as ofDecember
 31, 2017 and 2016 are  appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters couldresult
 in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note  13—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financia
l Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits
We
 maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations. See Note 14 —Employee Benefits 
in  the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefitpension plans and postretire
ment benefit plans.71

Table of ContentsThe Company’s pension and postretirement
 benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions providedby
 the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension andpostretirement
 benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected torepresent
 the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overalleconomy.
 These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptionsare:
•
Discount  Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made inthe
 future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would p
rovide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due;•
Expected  Return on Plan Assets (“EROA”)—Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily basedupon
 the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs werecord currently;
•
Rate of Compensation Increas e—Management projects employees’ pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement;•
Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Manage ment projects the expected increases in the cost of health care; and•
Mortality—Management retained  the Society of Actuaries RP-2014 mortality table but adopted the new MP-2017 generational projection scale to projectmortality improvem
ents after 2006.The discount rate assumption, which is
 determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistentwith
 changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. We use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailoredto
 the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. The yield curvewas
 developed for a portfolio containing the majority of United States-issued AA-graded non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) corporate bonds.For
 each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projectedbenefit
 payments.  The  discount  rate  for  determining  pension  benefit  obligations  was 3.75% , 4.28% and 4.66% at December  31,  2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
 The discount rate for determining other post-retirement benefit obligations was 3.73% , 4.26% and 4.67% at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
In
 selecting an EROA, we considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. The long-term
 EROA assumption used in calculating pension cost was 6.49% for 2017 , 7.02% for 2016 ,  and 6.91% for 2015 .  The weighted average EROA assumptionused in calculating othe
r postretirement benefit costs was 5.09% for 2017 , 5.37% for 2016 and 4.92% for 2015 . The asset allocations fo
r the Company’s U.S. pension plan by asset category were as follows:

t trusts (“REITs”) 2 % 2 % 2 %Total
 100 % 100 % 100 %During
 2017, the Company reduced the risk of its investments in the pension plan by reducing its exposure to equities from 60% to 50%, and increasing itslong
 duration fixed-income allocation from 40% to 50%. This new structure is designed to reduce the plan’s funded status volatility. It is also intended to reducethe
 pension plan’s exposure to interest rates since a higher proportion of long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of the pensionliabilities should reduce i
nterest rate risk associated with the plan’s liabilities.72

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded. The asset allocations for the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans by assetcategory were as follows:

The
 Company’s  target  asset  allocation,  is  evaluated  periodically  through  asset  liability  studies.  The  studies  consider  projected  cash  flows  of  maturityliabilities,
 projected asset class returns and risks, correlations, and the Company’s risk tolerance. In 2017, the Company conducted new asset-liability studies forthe
 Post-Retirement Plans and approved new asset allocations for both plans. The Post-Retirement Medical Bargaining plan increased its equity allocation from20%
 to 30% due to rising medical claims and medical inflation and the long duration portion of the portfolio was reduced from 80% to 70%. The Post-RetirementNon-Bargaining
 Medical Plan’s allocation was adjusted to reduce volatility and interest rate risk in a manner similar to that described above with respect to thepension
 plan, reducing the equity allocation from 70% to 60% and increasing the fixed-income allocation from 30% to 40%. The Post-Retirement Medical Non-Bargaining
 plan’s equity allocation was reduced due to the cap on benefits for some non-union participants and the resultant reduction in the plan’s liabilities.These changes will be imple
mented in 2018.The
 investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds.The
 trustee for the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement  welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of planassets. Additionally, the Company ind
ependently verifies the assets values. Approximately 41% of the assets are valued us ing the quoted market price for the assetsin an active market at the meas
urement date, while 59% of the assets are valued us ing other inputs.In
 selecting a rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. Our rate of compensation increase was3.02% 
for 2017 , 3.07% for 2016 and 3.10% for 2015 . In
 selecting health care cost trend rates, we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2017, our health carecost
 trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 7% in 2017 gradually  declining to 5% in 2021 and  thereafter. As of December 31, 2017, theCompany is projecting that m
edical inflation will continue to persist for longer than expected and, it will ultimately trend down to 4.50%, but not until 2026.Assumed
 health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. The health care cost trendrate
 is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the followingeffects:

We
 will use a discount rate and EROA of 3.75% and 5.95% ,  respectively, for estimating our 2018 pension  costs. Additionally, we will use a discount rateand
 expected blended return based on weighted assets of 3.73% and 4.77% , respectively,  for estimating our 2018 other postretirement  benefit costs. A decrease inthe discount
 rate or the EROA would increase our pension expense. Our 2017 and 2016 pension and  postretirement benefit costs were $56 million and $54 million,
 respectively. The Company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts up to $45 million in 2018 , and $47 million , $47million 
, $51 million and $58 million in 2019 , 2020 , 2021 and 2022 ,  respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates.The
 assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recordedpension
 and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards. As these assumptions changefrom period to period, re
corded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change.73

Table of ContentsAccounting for Contingencies
We record
 loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or arange
 of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates about the likely outcome ofthe
 matter,  which  may  include  an  analysis  of  different  scenarios.  Liabilities  are  recorded  or  adjusted  when  events  or  circumstances  cause  these  judgments  orestimates
 to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limed to: the nature of thelitigation,
 claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases orsituations.
 We provide disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may beincurred.
 We provide estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonablerange.
Actual
 amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on theliabilities,
 revenue  and  expenses  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  For  a  discussion  of  contingencies,  see Note  15—Commitments  andContingencies 
in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements.New Accounting Standards

Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financi al Statements for a description of recent accounting standards.ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCL OSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe
 are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. We are exposed to risks from changes ininterest
 rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rateexposure
 and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments, which couldinclude
 instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigateinterest rate
 risk exposure. As of December 31, 2017 ,  a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1% associated with our short-term borrowings would result in an$8 million 
increase in short-te rm interest expense.The
 Company  has  two  forward  starting  swap  agreements  with  an  aggregate  notional  amount  of  $200  million  to  reduce  interest  rate  exposure  on  debtexpected
 to be issued in 2018. The forward starting swap agreements terminate in November 2018 and have an average fixed rate of 2.59% .  When entering intoforward
 starting interest rate swaps, the Company is subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate that impacts the fairvalue
 of the forward starting interest rate swaps. We manage market risk by matching terms of the swaps with the critical terms of the expected debt issuance. Thefair value of the forward starting swaps at December 31, 2017 was in a loss position of 
$3 million . A hypothetical 1% adverse change in interest rates would resultin a decrease in the f
air value of our forward starting swaps of approximately $32 million at December 31, 2017 . Our
 risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expectedability
 to  recover  price  increases  through  rates,  in  the  next  general  rate  case  proceeding  or  other  regulatory  mechanism,  as  authorized  by  each  regulatoryjurisdiction. Non-perform
ance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.The
 market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to our operating performance. In particular, our stock pricemay be affected by gene
ral market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These could include, among otherthings,
 interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. This volatilitymay
 make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock, regardless of our financial performance,and such difficulty may pr
eclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations.We
 are exposed to credit risk through our water, wastewater and other water-related  services provided by our Regulated  Businesses and Market-BasedBusinesses 
.  Our Regulated  Businesses serve  residential,  commercial,  industrial  and  other  customers  while  our Market-Based  Businesses engage  in  businessactivities
 with developers, government entities and other customers. Our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and theassociated
 loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. Our credit risk is managed through established credit andcollection
 policies  which  are  in  compliance  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  involve  monitoring  of  customer  exposure  and  the  use  of  credit  riskmitigation
 measures  such  as  letters  of  credit  or  prepayment  arrangements.  Our  credit  portfolio  is  diversified  with  no  significant  customer  or  industryconcentrations.
 In  addition,  our Regulated  Businesses are  generally  able  to  recover  all  prudently  incurred  costs  including  uncollectible  customer  accountsreceivable expenses and 
collection costs through rates.74

Table of ContentsThe Company’s retirement trust assets are
 exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impactthe
 Company’s  pension  and  other  benefits  expense,  funded  status  and  future  minimum  funding  requirements.  Changes  in  interest  rates  can  impact  retirementliabilities.
 We aim to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of ourpension
 liabilities, seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of our liabilities. That way, if interest rates fall and liabilities increase, we expect that thefixed-income assets in ou
r retirement trust will also increase in value. We also expect our risk to be reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefitcosts through rates.
We are
 also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. The creditquality
 of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles andother
 market  changes.  In  addition,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  regulators  will  grant  sufficient  rate  authorizations.  Therefore,  our  ability  to  fully  recoveroperating expense, recove
r our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted. 75

Basis for Opinions
The
 Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,and
 for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  FinancialReporting
 appearing under Item 9A. Our  responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internalcontrol
 over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates) ("PCAOB") and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the Securi
ties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonableassurance
 about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internalcontrol over financial reporti
ng was maintained in all material respects.Our audits
 of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
 whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding
 the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates
 made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial  statements. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting
 included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  andevaluating
 the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in th
e circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financia
l ReportingA
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand
 the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions
 and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial
 statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  inaccordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.77

Table of ContentsBecause
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unless otherwise noted, in mil
lions, except per share data)Note 1: Organization and Operation
American
 Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “American  Water”)  is  the  holding  company  for  regulated  and  market-based  subsidiariesthroughout the
 United States and Ontario, Canada. The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater servicesin 
16 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the “ Regulated  Businesses .”  The Company also operates market-based businesses within four , non- reportable
 operating segments, collectively referred to as the “ Market-Based Businesses .”  These businesses include the Military Services Group, which conductsoperation
 and maintenance (“O&M”) of water and wastewater systems on military bases; the Homeowner Services Group, which primarily provides water andsewer
 line  protection  plans  for  homeowners;  the  Contract  Operations  Group,  which  conducts  O&M  of  water  and  wastewater  facilities  for  municipalities  andindustrial customers; 
and Keystone Clearwater Solutions, LLC (“Keystone”), which provides water services for natural gas exploration and production companies.Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The
 accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest ismaintained
 after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company uses the equity method to report its investments in joint ventures whereit holds up to a 
50% voting interest and cannot  exercise control over the operations and policies of the investments. Under the equity method, the Company recordsits interests as an inves
tment and its percentage share of the investee’s earnings as income or losses.In
 July  2015,  the  Company  acquired  a 95% interest  in  Water  Solutions  Holdings,  LLC,  including  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Keystone  ClearwaterSolutions, LLC (collectively referred to
 as “Keystone”). The outside stockholders’ interest, which is redeemable at the option of the minority owners, is recognizedas redeemable noncontrolling interest. The
 redeemable noncontrolling interest amounted to $7 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and is included in other long-term
 liabilities  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The  net  income  in 2017 and  the  net  loss  in 2016 ,  respectively,  attributable  to  thenoncontrolling
 interest was not significant. The Company has entered into an agreement whereby it has the option to acquire from the minority owners, and theminority
 owners have the option to sell to the Company, the remaining five percent interest at fair value, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, or at thedefined date of Decembe
r 31, 2018.Use of Estimates
The preparation
 of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management tomake
 estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ fromthese
 estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions.  The  Company  considers  its  critical  accounting  estimates  to  include:  the  application  of  regulatory  accountingprinciples and
 the related determination and estimation of regulatory assets and liabilities; assumptions used in impairment testing of goodwill and other long-livedassets,
 including regulatory assets; revenue recognition and the estimates used in the calculation of unbilled revenue; accounting for income taxes and the recentlyenacted
 Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (the  “TCJA”);  benefit  plan  assumptions;  and  the  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the  determining  loss  contingencies.  TheCompany’s
 critical  accounting  estimates  that  are  particularly  sensitive  to  change  in  the  near  term  are  amounts  reported  for  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,goodwill, income taxes, benef
it plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.Regulation
The
 Company’s regulated utilities are subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation,collectively
 referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs” or “Regulators”). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required forrate
 regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorizerevenue
 at  levels  intended  to  recover  the  estimated  costs  of  providing  service,  plus  a  return  on  net  investments,  or  rate  base.  Regulators  may  also  approveaccounting
 treatments,  long-term  financing  programs  and  cost  of  capital,  capital  expenditures,  O&M  expenses,  taxes,  transactions  and  affiliate  relationships,reorganizations
 and mergers,  and acquisitions,  along with imposing certain  penalties  or granting certain  incentives.  Due to timing and other differences  in thecollection
 of  a  regulated  utility’s  revenue,  an  incurred  cost  that  would  otherwise  be  charged  as  an  expense  by  a  non-regulated  entity,  could  be  deferred  as  aregulatory
 asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the authoritative accounting principles require the creation of aregulatory
 liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and arerefundable to customers. Se
e Note 6—Regulatory Assets and Liabili ties . 85

Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant
 and equipment consists primarily of utility plant. Additions to utility plant and replacement of retirement units of utility plant are capitalizedand
 include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering and supervision, transportation and an allowance forfunds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for r
epair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged to O&M expense as incurred.The
 cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life method. The Company’s regulated utilities recorddepreciation in
 conformity with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets’remaining useful lives.
When
 units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulateddepreciation.
 To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory assetis
 recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. Theseamounts
 result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets areincurred.
The
 costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of thesecosts amounted to 
$346 million and $345 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Nonutility
 property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Company for internal operations. This property is stated at cost, net ofaccumulated deprec
iation, which calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds
Substantially
 all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased areconsidered to be cash equiva
lents.Restricted
 funds consists primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future servicesunder
 O&M projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified in theConsolidated Balance Sheets as e
ither current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.The
 following table provides a reconciliation of the cash and cash equivalents, and restricted funds as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, to thesum of such amounts presented in

Accounts
 receivable include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers on a cyclebasis.
 Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based trade accountsreceivable
 and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has not been billedto customers and when costs exce
ed billings on market-based construction contracts.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Allowances
 for  uncollectible  accounts  are  maintained  for  estimated  probable  losses  resulting  from  the  Company’s  inability  to  collect  receivables  fromcustomers.
 Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowancefor
 uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due and previous loss history. The Company generally writes off accounts when theybecome uncollectibl
e or are over a certain number of days outstanding. See Note 5—Allowance for Uncollectib le Accounts . 86

Table of ContentsMaterials and Supplies
Materials and supplies a
re stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.Goodwill
Goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of abusiness.
 Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that wouldmore
 likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of the Company byRWE
 Aktiengesellschaft in 2003 and the acquisition of Keystone in 2015, and has been assigned to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of theacquisitions.
 The reporting units in the Regulated  Businesses segment  are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The Market-Based  Businesses is  comprised offour 
non-reportable  reporting units. The Company’s annual impairment test is performed as of November  30 of  each year, in conjunction with the completion ofthe
 Company’s annual business plan. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwillimpairment
 test. If based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, no further testing isrequired. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment or
 performs the qualitative assessment, but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair valueis less than its carrying 
amount, a quantitative two-step, fair value-based test is performed.The first
 step compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. If theestimated
 fair  value  of  any  reporting  unit  is  less  than  such  reporting  unit’s  carrying  value,  then  the  second  step  is  performed  to  measure  the  amount  of  theimpairment loss (if 
any) for such reporting unit.The
 second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order todetermine
 the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount for the reporting unit, an impairment loss isrecorded
 as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including theidentification
 of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Management estimates fair value using a combination of a discounted cashflow
 analysis and market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates and projected terminalvalues.
The
 Company  believes  the  assumptions  and  other  considerations  used  to  value  goodwill  to  be  appropriate.  However,  if  experience  differs  from  theassumptions and
 considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 7—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
. Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
 assets include land, buildings, equipment and long-term investments. Long-lived assets, other than investments and land, are depreciated overtheir
 estimated useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.Such
 circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the manner theasset
 is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition, or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In addition,changes in
 the expected useful life of these long-lived assets may also be an impairment indicator. When such events or changes occur, the Company estimates thefair
 value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset and compares that to thecarrying value of the ass
et. If the carrying value is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded.The
 Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets are appropriate. However, if actualexperience
 differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.
The key
 variables to determine fair value include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operating costs, labor and other benefit costs, capital additions,assumed
 discount rates and other economic factors. These variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties, since they areforecasting future
 events. If such assets are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceedsits fair value.
The
 long-lived  assets  of  the  regulated  utility  subsidiaries  are  tested  on  a  separate  entity  basis  for  impairment  testing  as  they  are  integrated  state-wideoperations that
 do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery inrates of that asset is no 
longer probable.The
 Company holds other investments including investments in privately held companies and investments in joint ventures accounted for using the equitymethod.
 The Company’s investments in privately held companies and joint ventures are classified as other long-term assets in the accompanying ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.

87
Table of ContentsThe
 fair values of long-term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which the Company invests, as well asvolatility
 inherent  in  the  external  markets.  If  such  assets  are  considered  impaired,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  equal  to  the  amount  by  which  the  asset’scarrying value exceeds 
its fair value.Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction
Regulated
 utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estatedevelopers to fund construct
ion necessary to extend service to new areas.Advances
 are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Included inother current
 liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 in the  accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $23 million and $21 million, respectively. Those amounts 
represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period.Advances
 that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions. Contributions are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particularconstruction
 project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-investor supplied funds.
Generally,
 the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense,producing
 a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatoryguidelines,
 some of  the Company’s utility  subsidiaries  do  not amortize  contributions,  and any  contribution  received  remains  on the  balance  sheet  indefinitely.Amortization
 of contributions in aid of construction was $27  million , $27 million and $26 million for  the years ended December  31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Recognition of Revenues
Revenues
 of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are provided, and include amounts billed to customers on acycle
 basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill to the end of the accountingperiod.
 The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited tocustomers will occur through 
the ratemaking process.The
 Company has agreements with the U.S. government to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems at various military bases pursuant to 50 -year
 contracts (“military agreements”). These contracts also include construction components that are accounted for separately from the O&M components. Nine of the military agreements are s
ubject to periodic price redetermination adjustments and modifications for changes in circumstance. The remaining four agreements are
 subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redeterminations. Additionally, the Company has agreements ranging in length fromone 
to 25 years with municipalities and businesses in various industries to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems (“O&M agreements”). Revenuesfrom operations and manag
ement services are recognized as services are provided. See Note 15—Commitments and Contingenci es . Revenues
 from  construction  projects  are  recognized  over  the  contract  term  based  on  the  costs  incurred  to  date  during  the  period  compared  to  the  totalestimated
 costs over the entire contract. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable. Revenuesrecognized
 during  the  period  in  excess  of  billings  on  construction  contracts  are  recorded  as  unbilled  revenue.  Billings  in  excess  of  revenues  recognized  onconstruction contracts
 are recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contractprofitability may r
esult in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined.Income Taxes
American
 Water and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group arecharged with the amou
nt of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.Certain
 income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Companyprovides
 deferred  income  taxes  on  the  difference  between  the  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  amounts  at  which  they  are  carried  in  the  financialstatements.
 These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. Inaddition,
 the  regulated  utility  subsidiaries  recognize  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  effect  on  revenues  expected  to  be  realized  as  the  tax  effects  oftemporary differen
ces, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.Investment tax
 credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives ofthe related assets.

88
Table of ContentsThe
 Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collectedfrom customers and rem
itted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 13—Income Taxes . Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC
 is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity fundsdevoted
 to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable toborrowed
 funds is shown as a reduction of interest, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equityfunds
 would be included in other income (expenses) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. AFUDC is summarized in the following tablefor the years ended  
December 31 :  
2017  2016  2015 Allowance for other funds used during 
construction$ 19  $15  $13 Allowance for borrowed funds used during cons
truction8  6  8 Environmental Costs
The
 Company’s water and wastewater operations and the operations of its Market-Based  Businesses are  subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreignrequirements
 relating  to  environmental  protection,  and  as  such,  the  Company  periodically  becomes  subject  to  environmental  claims  in  the  normal  course  ofbusiness. Environmental expenditures that
 relate to current operations or provide a future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs thatrelate
 to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can bereasonably
 estimated. A conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2010and
 amended in 2017 required the Company to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the CarmelRiver
 watershed in the State of California. The Company agreed to pay $1  million annually  commencing in 2010 with the final payment being made in 2021.Remediation costs accru
ed amounted to $6 million and less than $1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative fin
ancial instruments for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are enteredinto
 for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter intoderivative contrac
ts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.All
 derivatives  are  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  On  the  date  the  derivative  contract  is  entered  into,  the  Company  may  designate  thederivative as a hedge of the fair
 value of a recognized asset or liability (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows tobe received or paid related t
o a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlyi
ng hedged item, are recorded in current-period earnings. The gainsand
 losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.Any ineffective portion of d
esignated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.Cash flows from derivative con
tracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.89

Revenue from
Contracts with
Customers
 
Changes the criteria for recognizing revenue from a contract with acustomer. Replaces existing guidance on revenue recognition, including
most industry specific guidance. The objective is to provide a single,
comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with
customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries
and across capital markets. The underlying principle is that an entity wi
llrecognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to
customers at an amount the entity expects to be enti
tled to in exchangefor those goods or services. The guidance also requires a number of
disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenue and the related cash flows.

 Company’s deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $270 million 
and $300 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The rem aining portion is the pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to thepension plans which is deferred by 
certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension plan.The
 Company has recorded a regulatory asset for the additional revenues expected to be realized when the tax effects of temporary differences previouslyflowed
 through to customers, reverse. These temporary differences are primarily related to the difference between book and tax depreciation on property placed inservice before
 the adoption by the regulatory authorities of full normalization for rate making purposes. Full normalization requires no flow through of tax benefitsto
 customers.  The regulatory  asset for income taxes recoverable  through rates is net of the reduction  expected  in future revenues as deferred  taxes previouslyprovided,
 attributable to the difference between the state and federal income tax rates under prior law and the current statutory rates, reverse over the averageremaining service lives of t
he related assets.Removal costs recoverabl
e through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs.93

 Clemente  Dam  project  costs  represent  costs  incurred  and  deferred  by  the  Company’s  California  subsidiary  pursuant  to  its  efforts  to  investigatealternatives
 to  strengthen  or  remove  the  dam  due  to  potential  earthquake  and  flood  safety  concerns.  In  June  2012,  the  California  Public  Utilities  Commission(“CPUC”)
 issued a decision authorizing implementation of a project to reroute the Carmel River and remove the San Clemente Dam. The project includes theCompany’s California
 subsidiary, the California State Conservancy and the National Marine Fisheries Services. Under the order’s terms, the CPUC has authorizedrecovery
 for pre-construction costs, interim dam safety measures and environmental costs and construction costs. The authorized costs are to be recovered via asurcharge
 over a twenty -year  period which began in October 2012. The unrecovered balance of project costs incurred, including cost of capital, net of surchargestotaled 
$89  million and $91 million as  of December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. Surcharges collected were $7  million and $4 million for  the years endedDecember

al recovery amount.Regulatory
 balancing  accounts  accumulate  differences  between  revenues  recognized  and  authorized  revenue  requirements  until  they  are  collected  fromcustomers or are refund
ed. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs and purchased power and water accounts.Debt
 expense is amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Call premiums on the redemption of long-term debt, as well as unamortized debt expense,are deferred and amo
rtized to the extent they will be recovered through future service rates.As
 a result of American Water Capital Corp.’s prepayment of the 5.62% Series  C Senior Notes due December 21, 2018 (“Series C Senior Notes”) and5.77% 
Series  D Senior Notes due December 21, 2021 (“Series D Senior Notes”) and payment of a make-whole premium amount to the holders thereof of $34 million 
,  the Company recorded a $6  million charge  resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company. Substantially all of the early debtextinguishment
 costs allocable to the Company’s utility subsidiaries were recorded as regulatory assets that the Company believes are probable of recovery infuture rates. Approximat
ely $1 million of the early debt extingu ishment costs allocable to the Company’s utility subsidiaries was amortized in 2017.Purchase
 premium  recoverable  through  rates  is  primarily  the  recovery  of  the  acquisition  premiums  related  to  an  asset  acquisition  by  the  Company’sCalifornia
 Utility subsidiary during 2002, and acquisitions in 2007 by the Company’s New Jersey Utility subsidiary. As authorized for recovery by the Californiaand New Jersey PUCs, these costs are being amo
rtized to depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations through November 2048.Tank painting costs are generally deferred and amortized to operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidate
d Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over periods rang
ing from two to fifteen years, as authorized b y the regulatory authorities in their determination of rates charged for service.Other
 regulatory  assets  include  certain  construction  costs  for  treatment  facilities,  property  tax  stabilization,  employee-related  costs,  deferred  otherpostretirement
 benefit expense, business services project expenses, coastal water project costs, rate case expenditures and environmental remediation costs amongothers. These costs are def
erred because the amounts are being recovered in rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods.Regulatory Liabilities
Regulatory
 liabilities generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate-making process. Also, ifcosts
 expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.The following table 
summarizes the composition of regulatory liabilities as of December 31 :

Table of ContentsIncome
 taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Company’s customers. On December  22, 2017 ,  the TCJAwas
 signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a reduction in themaximum
 U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as  of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significant excess deferred income taxes that theCompany
 and its regulatory  jurisdictions  believe  should be refunded  to customers.  Since these  are significant  refundable  amounts, the Company believes  it isprobable these amounts will b
e refunded to customers through future rates, and as such the amounts are recorded to a regulatory liability.Removal
 costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful life that are recovered through customer ratesover
 the life  of  the associated  assets.  In  December  2008,  the  Company’s utility  subsidiary  in New Jersey,  at the  direction  of  the New Jersey  Board of  PublicUtilities,
 began to depreciate $48 million of  the total balance into depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations via straightline amortization 
through November 2048.Pension
 and  other  postretirement  benefit  balancing  accounts  represent  the  difference  between  costs  incurred  and  costs  authorized  by  the  PUCs that  areexpected to be refunded to 
customers.Other regulatory liabi
lities include legal settlement proceeds, deferred gains and various regulatory balancing accounts.Note 7: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

$ 3,492  $(2,332 )  $327  $(108 ) $3,819  $(2,440 )  $1,379 In 
2017 ,  the  Company  acquired  aggregate  goodwill  of $29  million associated  with four of  its  acquisitions  in  the Regulated  Businesses segment. Additionally,
 during 2017 the  Company  recorded  a  measurement  period  adjustment  of $5  million ,  increasing  the  goodwill  recognized  from  the  Scrantonacquisition completed 
in December 2016.In 
2016 , the Company acquired aggrega te goodwill of $43 million associated with five of its acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses segment. The
 Company completed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of November  30 , 2017 and 2016 .  It elected to apply the qualitative assessmentof
 factors  for  goodwill  in  our Regulated  Businesses and  in  Military  Services  Group  and  Contract  Operations  Group  reporting  units  within  the Market-Based Businesses 
for both November 30 , 2017 and 2016 .  The Company also elected to apply the qualitative assessment of factors for annual impairment assessment ofgoodwill
 as of November  30 , 2016 to  its Homeowners Services Group. Based on the work performed, the Company determined that no qualitative factors werepresent that would indicat
e the estimated fair values of the above stated reporting units were less than the respective carrying values.At 
November  30 , 2017 ,  the  Company  completed  step  one  of  the  two-step  test  for  its  Homeowner  Services  Group  and  Keystone  reporting  units.  TheCompany
 also completed a step one test for the Keystone reporting unit at November  30 , 2016 .  Based on those valuations, the Company concluded that therewere
 no impairments to its goodwill. The Company used an income approach valuation technique which estimates the discounted future cash flows of operations.The
 discounted cash flow analysis relies on a single scenario reflecting the best estimate of projected cash flows. Significant assumptions were used in estimatingthe
 fair values, including the discount rate, growth rate and terminal value. At November  30 , 2017 ,  the estimated fair value of the Homeowner Services Groupreporting
 unit  exceeded  its  carrying  value  by  more  than 156% ,  and  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  Keystone  reporting  unit  exceeded  its  carrying  value  byapproximately 
11% .  If further decline in the fair value were to occur, the Keystone reporting unit would be at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairmenttest.

Table of ContentsThere
 can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or otherfactors
 related to the performance of the Company’s reporting units. These market events could include a decline over a period of time of the Company’s stockprice,
 a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities and reporting unit companies, the lack of an increase in the Company’smarket
 price consistent with its peer companies, decreases in control premiums or continued downward pressure on commodity prices. A decline in the forecastedresults
 in our business plan, such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairmentcharge. In regards to the Keys
tone goodwill, adverse developments in market conditions, including prolonged depression of natural gas or oil prices or other factorsthat
 negatively impact our forecast operating results, cash flows or key assumptions in the future could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of thegoodwill balance.
Other Intangible Assets
Included in other long-te
rm assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , is a $8 million and $10 million , respectively, custome r relationship intangible resultingfrom the Keystone acquisit
ion. This intangible is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of eight years. Note 8: Stockholders’ Equity
Common Stock
Under
 the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the “DRIP”), stockholders may reinvest cash dividends and purchase additional Companycommon
 stock, up to certain limits, through the plan administrator without commission fees. Shares purchased by participants through the DRIP may be newly-issued
 shares, treasury shares, or at the Company’s election, shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.Purchases generally will be 
made and credited to DRIP accounts once each week. As of December 31, 2017 , there were approximately 4.3 million shares available for future issuance under 
the DRIP.Anti-dilutive Stock Repurchase Program
In
 February 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program, which allowed the Company to purchase up to10
 million shares  of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time. The Company repurchased 0.7  million shares  and 1.0  million shares  ofcommon
 stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $54  million and $65 million under  this program for the years ended December  31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As of 
December 31, 2017 , there were 6.1 million shares of common stock avai lable for purchase under the program.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Table of ContentsThe
 Company does not reclassify the amortization of defined benefit pension cost components from accumulated other comprehensive loss directly to netincome in its entirety,
 as a portion of these costs have been capitalized as a regulatory asset. These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are includedin the computation of net p
eriodic pension cost. See Note 14—Employee Benefits . The
 amortization of the loss on cash flow hedge is reclassified to net income during the period incurred and is included in interest, net in the accompanyingConsolidated Statements of Oper
ations.Note 9: Stock Based Compensation
The
 Company  has  granted  stock  options  and  restricted  stock  unit  (“RSU”)  awards  to  non-employee  directors,  officers  and  other  key  employees  of  theCompany pursuant to the terms of 
its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). The total aggregate number of shares of common stock that maybe issued under the 2007 Plan is 
15.5 million . As of December 31, 2017 , 7.7 million shares were available for grant under the 2007 Plan.On
 May 12, 2017, the Company’s stockholders approved the American Water Works Company, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2017Omnibus
 Plan”). A total of  7.2 million shares  of common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December  31, 2017 , 7.2 million shares were available
 for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the following forms: incentive stockoptions, nonqualified
 stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents, which may be grantedonly
 on stock units or other stock-based awards. Following the approval of the 2017 Omnibus Plan, no additional awards are to be granted under the 2007 Plan.However, shares will still be issu
ed under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the terms of awards previously issued under that plan prior to May 12, 2017.The
 cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant datefair
 value of the awards issued. The value of stock options and RSUs awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the three-year serviceperiod.
 All awards granted in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 are  classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vestingperiod of
 the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate iscompared
 to the actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. The following table presents stock-based compensation expenserecorded in operation and 
maintenance expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31 :

no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The Company receives a tax dedu
ction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for RSUs. Foreach
 award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company recognizes the tax benefits, which have been included in deferred income tax assets, related tocompensation
 costs. The tax deductions in excess of the benefits recorded throughout the requisite service period are recorded to the Consolidated Statements ofOperations and are present
ed in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Stock Options
There
 were no grants of stock options to employees in 2017 .  In 2016 and 2015 ,  the Company granted non-qualified stock options to certain employeesunder
 the 2007 Plan. The stock options vest ratably over the three -year  service period beginning on January 1 of the year of the grant and have no performancevesting conditions. Expense is re
cognized using the straight-line method and is amortized over the requisite service period.97

 Company used the actual historical experience of exercises or expirations of the 2009 grant to determine the expected stock option life. The Companybegan
 granting stock options at the time of its initial public offering in April 2008. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average of historic volatilities oftraded
 common  stock  of  peer  companies  (regulated  water  companies)  over  the  expected  term  of  the  stock  options  and  historic  volatilities  of  the  Company’scommon
 stock during the period it has been publicly traded. The dividend yield is based on the Company’s expected dividend payments and the stock price on thedate
 of grant. The risk-free interest rate is the market yield on U.S. Treasury strips with maturities similar to the expected term of the stock options. The exerciseprice
 of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. Stock options vest over periods ranging from one tothree 
years and have a maximum term of seven years from the effe ctive date of the grant.The table below summariz

During 
2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company granted RSUs, both with and without performance conditi ons, to certain employees under the 2007 Plan. RSUsgenerally vest over per
iods ranging from one to three years. During 
2017 , the  Company granted RSUs to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan, and during 2016 and 2015 , these awards were granted under
 the 2007 Plan. The RSUs vested on the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlier of: (i) 15 months aftergrant
 date, subject to any deferral election by the director; or (ii) the participant’s separation from service. Because these RSUs vested on the grant date, the totalgrant date fair valu
e was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.98

Table of ContentsThe
 RSUs without performance conditions are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant andvest
 ratably over the three -year  service period beginning January 1 of the year of the grant. These RSUs are amortized through expense over the requisite serviceperiod using the straight-
line method.The table below summariz

 with internal performance measures are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.RSUs
 granted with market conditions are valued using a Monte Carlo model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of traded common stock of theCompany
 and comparative companies using daily stock prices over the past three years. The expected term is three years  and the risk-free interest rate is based onthe
 three-year U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the measurement date. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the Monte Carlosimulation and the weighted

Table of ContentsIf
 dividends are paid with respect to shares of the Company’s common stock before the RSUs are distributed, the Company credits a liability for the valueof the dividends
 that would have been paid if the RSUs were shares of Company common stock. When the RSUs are distributed, the Company pays the participanta
 lump sum cash payment equal to the value of the dividend equivalents accrued. The Company accrued dividend equivalents totaling less  than $1 million , $1million 
and $1 million to  accumulated deficit in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2017 
, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The
 Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) through which employee participants may use payroll deductions toacquire
 Company common stock at the lesser of 90% of  the fair market value of the common stock at either the beginning or the end of a three-month purchaseperiod.
 On February 15, 2017, the Board adopted the American Water Works Company, Inc. and its Designated Subsidiaries 2017 Nonqualified Employee StockPurchase
 Plan, which was approved by stockholders on May 12, 2017 and took effect on August 5, 2017. The prior plan was terminated as to new purchases ofCompany
 stock effective August 31, 2017. As of December  31, 2017 ,  there were 2.0  million shares  of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. TheESPP
 is considered compensatory. During the years ended December  31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  the Company issued 93 thousand , 93 thousand and 98 thousandshares, respectively, unde
r the ESPP.Note 10: Long-Term Debt

August 10, 2017 ,  AWCC completed a $1.35  billion debt  offering which included the sale of $600  million aggregate  principal amount of its 2.95% Senior Notes
 due 2027, and $750 million aggregate principal  amount of its 3.75% Senior  Notes due in 2047. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, afterdeduction
 of  underwriting  discounts  and  debt  issuance  costs, $1.33  billion .  On September  13,  2017, AWCC used  proceeds  from  the  offering  to prepay $138 million 
of  its outstanding 5.62% Series  C Senior Notes due December 21, 2018 (“Series C Senior Notes”) and $181  million of  it’s outstanding 5.77% Series  DSenior
 Notes due December 21, 2021 (“Series D Senior Notes”). AWCC also used the proceeds of this offering to repay commercial paper obligations and forgeneral corporate purpos
es, and subsequently, on October 15, 2017, to repay at maturity, $524 million of its 6.085% Senior Notes. As
 a result of AWCC’s prepayment of the Series C Senior Notes and Series D Senior Notes, and payment of a make-whole premium amount to the holdersthereof
 of $34  million ,  the Company recorded a $6  million charge  resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company. Substantially all of theearly debt extinguishmen

Table of ContentsInterest net, includes intere
st income of approximately $14 million , $14 million and $13 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. One
 of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows riskmanagement
 policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managingcommercial
 paper and debt maturities. The Company also does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.The
 derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties toderivative
 contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions havinglong-term credit r
atings of “A” or better.On 
August 7, 2017 ,  coinciding with AWCC’s $1.35 billion debt offering,  the Company terminated four existing  forward starting swap agreements with anaggregate
 notional  amount  of $300  million ,  realizing  a  gain  of $19  million to  be  amortized  through  interest,  net,  over 30 years.  On  February  8,  2017,  andDecember 11, 2017, the
 Company entered into forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of $100 million , to reduce interest r ate exposure ondebt expected to
 be issued in 2018. These forward starting swap agreements terminate in November 2018, and have an average fixed rate of 2.59% . The Company has designated
 these forward starting swap agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. Upontermination, the cumulative
 gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net, over the term of the newdebt.
In
 October 2017, the Company terminated its interest-rate swap to hedge $100  million of  its 6.085% Senior  Notes maturing in the fourth quarter of 2017.The
 Company paid variable interest of six-month LIBOR plus 3.422% ,  and had designated this interest rate swap as a fair value hedge, accounted for at fair valuewith
 gains or losses, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged item, recognized in interest, net. The net gain and loss recognized by the Company wasde minimis for the per

Short-term
 debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $905  million and $849 million as  of December  31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As of 
December 31, 2017 there were no borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.AWCC has a
 revolving credit facility with $1.75 billion in aggregate  total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions with a terminationdate
 of June 2020. On March 22, 2016, AWCC and its lenders agreed to increase total commitments under AWCC’s revolving credit facility to the $1.75 billion , from 
$1.25  billion .  Other terms and conditions of the existing facility remained unchanged. The agreement also includes a $150  million sublimit  for letters ofcredit
 and  a $100  million sublimit  for  swing  loans.  On  June  30,  2015,  AWCC  and  its  lenders  extended  the  termination  date  of  revolving  credit  facility  fromOctober 2018, to June 2020. 
This amended and restated agreement also allowed AWCC to request to further extend the term of the credit facility for up to two one-year periods. 
Issuance costs  related to the increased lending commitments will be amortized over the remaining life of the credit facility and is included in interest,net in the accompanying Consolid
ated Statements of Operations. Interest on borrowings are based on a LIBOR-based rate, plus an applicable margin.102

Table of ContentsAlso,
 the Company acquired a line of credit facility as part of the Keystone acquisition. This facility has a maximum availability of up to $12  million , dependent on
 a collateral base calculation. Based on the collateral assets at December 31, 2017 , $7 million was available  to borrow. At December 31, 2017 , there were 
no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit facility. Borrowings under the facility are due upon demand with interest being paid monthly. Interest accrueseach
 day at a rate per annum equal to 2.75% above the  greater of the one month  or one day LIBOR . The borrowing base under the facility allows for financing upto the greater of the no

Letters  of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. The Company had $84  million and $88 million of outstanding letters of credit as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, all of which were issued under the revolving credit facility noted above. The following table summar

 Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00 . The ratio as of December 31, 2017 
was 0.59 to 1.00 . None
 of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading couldincrease fees and int
erest charges under the Company’s credit facility.As
 part of the normal course of business, the Company routinely enters contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services. Thesecontracts
 either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance whenthere
 are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency,especially
 if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis formaking
 a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on the Company’s net position with the counterparty, the demand could be for theposting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed provision
s that specify the collateral that must be provided, the obligation to supply the collateral requestedwill
 be a function of the facts and circumstances of the Company’s situation at the time of the demand. If the Company can reasonably claim that it is willing andfinancially
 able to perform its obligations, it may be possible that no collateral would need to be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months offuture
 payments should be sufficient. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results ofoperations, financial pos
ition or cash flows.Note 12: General Taxes

December 22, 2017 , President Trump signed into law th e TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginningafter
 December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), including amendments whichsignificantly
 change the taxation of individuals and business entities, and includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. The more significantchanges that
 impact the Company included in the TCJA are reductions in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% , and several technica l provisionsincluding,
 among others, limiting the utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of  taxable income with an indefinitecarryforward.
 The  specific  provisions  related  to  regulated  public  utilities  in  the  TCJA  generally  allow  for  the  continued  deductibility  of  interest  expense,  theelimination
 of  full  expensing  for  tax  purposes  of  certain  property  acquired  after  September  27,  2017  and  continue  certain  rate  normalization  requirements  foraccelerated depr
eciation benefits. Non-regulated segments of the Company’s business will be able to take advantage of the full expensing provisions of the TCJA.Changes
 in  the  Code  from  the  TCJA  had  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  statements  in  2017.  Under  GAAP,  specifically  Accounting  StandardsCodification (“ASC”)
 Topic 740, Income Taxes, the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 alsorequires deferred
 income tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled.Thus,
 at  the  date  of  enactment,  the  Company’s  deferred  income  taxes  were  re-measured  based  upon  the  new  tax  rate.  For  the  Company’s  regulated  entities,substantially
 all  of  the  change  in  deferred  income  taxes  are  recorded  as  either  an  offset  to  a  regulatory  asset  or  liability  because  changes  are  expected  to  berecovered
 by or refunded to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred income taxes is recorded as a non-cash re-measurementadjustment to earnings.

Table of ContentsThe
 staff  of  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  “SEC”)  has  recognized  the  complexity  of  reflecting  the  impacts  of  the  TCJA,  and  onDecember
 22, 2017 issued guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) which clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if information isnot
 yet  available  or  complete  and  provides  for  up  to  a  one  year  period  in  which  to  complete  the  required  analyses  and  accounting.  SAB  118  describes  threescenarios
 or buckets associated with a company’s status of accounting for income tax reform: (1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects oftax
 reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) acompany
 is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply ASC 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effectimmediately
 prior to the TCJA being enacted. The Company has made a reasonable estimate for the measurement and accounting of certain effects of the TCJAwhich
 have been reflected in the December 31, 2017 financial statements. The re-measurement of deferred income taxes at the new federal tax rate increased the2017 deferred
 income tax provision by $125 million for the  year ending December 31, 2017. Additionally, the accumulated deferred income tax liability decreasedby 
$1.39 billion and regulatory liabil ities increased by $1.51 billion , respectively, as of Dece mber 31, 2017.As provided for under SAB 118, the Company has not record
ed the impact for certain items under TCJA for which it has not yet been able to gather, prepareand
 analyze  the necessary  information  in reasonable  detail  to complete  the ASC 740 accounting.  For these  items, which include  the impact  of TCJA on stateincome taxes,
 the current and deferred income taxes were recognized and measured based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior tothe
 TCJA being enacted. The current and deferred state taxes are $25  million and $50 million as  of December 31, 2017, respectively. The determination of theimpact
 of the income tax effects of these items and the items reflected as provisional amounts will require additional analysis of historical records and furtherinterpretation
 of the TCJA from yet to be issued U.S. Treasury regulations which will require more time, information and resources than currently available to theCompany.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The
 Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations.Benefits
 under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pensionplans
 were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groupsspecified in
 the Plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hiredon
 or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are provided with a 5.25% of  base pay defined contribution plan. TheCompany
 does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental non-qualified pension plans that provideadditional retirement benefits to
 certain employees.The Company’s pension
 funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct
 of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional contributions if needed to avoid “at risk” status and benefit restrictions under thePension
 Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financial requirements and the plans’ fundedposition.
 Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in ratescharged
 for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note 6—Regulatory  Assets and Liabilities .  Pension plan assets are invested in a number ofactively
 managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contracts with insurance companies,real estate funds and r
eal estate investment trusts (“REITs”).106

Table of ContentsThe
 Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfareplans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 20
06. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002.The
 Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number ofactively managed and co
mmingled funds including equities and fixed income securities.The
 investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted-average credit rating of A or better byStandard
 & Poor’s. None of the Company’s securities are included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets. The investment policies’ objectives arefocused on reducing the volat
ility of the plans’ funded status over a long term horizon.The
 Company  uses  fair  value  for  all  classes  of  assets  in  the  calculation  of  market-related  value  of  plan  assets.  As  of  2017,  the  fair  values  and  assetallocations of
 the pension plan assets include the American Water Pension Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, and the Shorelands WaterCompany, Inc. Pension Plan.

 Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and riskmitigation
 strategies  for  the  plans  are  tailored  specifically  for  each  trust.  In  setting  new  strategic  asset  mixes,  consideration  is  given  to  the  likelihood  that  theselected
 asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updatesthe
 long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations  for  these  plans  through  asset  liability  studies  and  uses  various  analytics  to  determine  the  optimal  asset  allocation.Considerations
 include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. Strategies toaddress
 the goal of ensuring sufficient assets to pay benefits include target allocations to a broad array of asset classes and, within asset classes, strategies areemployed to provide adequat
e returns, diversification and liquidity.In
 2012,  the  Company  implemented  a  de-risking  strategy  for  the  American  Water  Pension  Plan  after  conducting  an  asset-liability  study  to  reduce  thevolatility
 of the funded status of the plan. As part of the de-risking strategy, the Company revised the asset allocations to increase the matching characteristics offixed-income
 assets  relative  to  liabilities.  The  fixed  income  portion  of  the  portfolio  was  designed  to  match  the  bond-like  and  long-dated  nature  of  thepostretirement
 liabilities. In 2017, the Company further increased its exposure to liability-driven investing and increased its fixed-income allocation to 50% , up from 40%, in an effort to 
further decrease the funded status volatility of the plan and hedge the portfolio from movements in interest rates.108

Table of ContentsIn
 2012, the Company also implemented a de-risking strategy for the medical bargaining trust within the plan to minimize volatility. In 2017, the Companyconducted
 a new asset-liability study that indicated medical trend inflation that outpaced the Consumer Price Index by more than 2% for the last 20 years. Givencontinuously
 rising medical costs, the Company decided to increase the equity exposure of the portfolio to 30% ,  up from 20%, while reducing the fixed-incomeportion
 of  the  portfolio  from 80% to  70%.  The  Company  also  conducted  an  asset-liability  study  for  the  Post-Retirement  Non-Bargaining  Medical  Plan.  Itsallocation
 was adjusted to make it more conservative, reducing the equity allocation from 70% to 60% and  increasing the fixed-income allocation from 30% to40% 
.  The Post-Retirement Medical Non-Bargaining plan’s equity allocation was reduced due to the cap on benefits for some non-union participants and resultantreduction in the plan’s l
iabilities. These changes will take place in 2018.The
 Company engages third party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixedincome,
 equity,  alternatives)  or  strategy  for  which  they  have  been  appointed.  Investment  management  agreements  and  recurring  performance  and  attributionanalysis
 are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used toadjust portfolio duration 
to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.In
 order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to fixed income investments that are exposed to interestrate
 risk.  Increases  in  interest  rates  generally  will  result  in  a  decline  in  the  value  of  fixed  income  assets  while  reducing  the  present  value  of  the  liabilities.Conversely,
 rate  decreases  will  increase  fixed  income  assets,  partially  offsetting  the  related  increase  in  the  liabilities.  Within  equities,  risk  is  mitigated  byconstructing a portfolio 
that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process.Actual
 allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of timeit
 takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, ifnecessary.

Cash—Cash
 and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are consideredcash and are included in th
e recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.Equity
 securities—For  equity  securities,  the  trustees  obtain  prices  from  pricing  services,  whose  prices  are  obtained  from  direct  feeds  from  marketexchanges,
 that the Company is able to independently corroborate. Equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level1. Certain equities, such as international securities held in the pensio
n plan are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds are valued toreflect
 the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since net asset value is not directly observable or not available on anationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds
, they are categorized as Level 2. For limited partnerships, the assets as a whole are categorizedas
 level 3 due to the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In addition, the limited partnership vehiclecannot be readily traded.
Fixed-income
 securities—The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid
 and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bondsare
 based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. They are categorized as Level 2 because thevaluations are calcu
lated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate.111

 annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these market values are determined by theprovider,
 they  are  not  highly  observable  and  have  been  categorized  as  Level  3.  Exchange-traded  future  and  option  positions  are  reported  in  accordance  withchanges

 July 31, 2016, the other postretirement benefit plan was re-measured to reflect a plan amendment, which capped benefits for certain non-union planparticipants. The
 re-measurement included an $156 million reduction  in future benefits payable to plan participants, and resulted in an $89 million reduction to the net
 accrued postretirement benefit obligation. The plan amendment will be amortized over 10.2 years, the  average future working lifetime to full eligibility age forall plan participants.

its Bargaining Trust.In
 August 2006, the PPA was signed into law in the U.S. The PPA replaces the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring thatdefined benefit plans
 contribute to 100% of the current liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of thecurrent liability 
are defined as being “at risk” and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPA was effective for the 2008 plan yearwith
 short-term phase-in provisions for both the funding target and at-risk determination. The Company’s qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded abovethe
 at-risk threshold, and therefore the Company expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company isproactively monitoring 
the plan’s funded status and projected contributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.Minimum
 funding  requirements  for  the  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  are  determined  by  government  regulations  and  not  by  accountingpronouncements.
 The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to the greater of the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2018 to the qualified pension plans. The Company p
lans to contribute to its 2018 other postretiremen t benefit cost for rate-making purposes.Information about the exp

577  192  12 Because the above amounts ar
e net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.Accounting
 for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turno
ver and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. Theassumptions
 are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capitalmarkets and the overal
l economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes.The significant assumptions 
related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans were as follows:

The
 discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently. At year-end 2011, the Company began usingan
 approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the couponsand
 expected  maturity  values  of  individually  selected  bonds. The  yield  curve  was  developed  for a  universe  containing  the  majority  of  U.S.-issued  AA-gradedcorporate
 bonds, all of which were non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions). Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the levelequivalent rate tha
t would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.114

Table of ContentsThe
 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment managementfees,
 for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes wereselected
 after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocationfor
 each  asset  class,  the  overall  expected  rate  of  return  for  the  portfolio  was  developed,  adjusted  for  historical  and  expected  experience  of  active  portfoliomanagement
 results compared to the benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. The Company’s pension expense increases as theexpected
 return on assets decreases. The Company used an expected return on plan assets of 6.49% to  estimate its 2017 pension benefit costs, and an expectedblended return based on weighted 
assets of 5.09% to estimate its 2017 ot her postretirement benefit costs.In
 the determination of year end 2014 projected benefit plan obligations, the Company adopted a new table based on the Society of Actuaries RP 2014mortality
 table including a generational BB-2D projection scale. The adoption resulted in a significant increase to pension and other postretirement benefit plans’projected benefit obligations. In
 2015 a new MP 2015 Projection Scale was issued, but not adopted by the Company since all of the experience upon which the MP2015
 Projection  Scale  is  based  was  considered  by  the  Company  in  selecting  its  2014  assumptions.  For  year-end  2017,  the  Company  retained  the  Society  ofActuaries
 RP-2014 mortality table as its base mortality table but adopted the new MP-2017 generational projection scale to project mortality improvements after2006.
Assumed
 health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. The health care cost trendrate
 is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the followingeffects:

 Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan participants is reduced by greater than 10% due  to anevent that results in terminati
ons and/or retirements.Cumulative
 gains and losses that are in excess of 10% of  the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortizedover the expected average remai

The
 Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions thatare
 invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject tocertain
 limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006 the Company began providing anadditional 
5.25% of  base  pay  defined  contribution  benefit  for  union  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2001  and  non-union  employees  hired  on  or  afterJanuary
 1, 2006. Plan expenses totaled $13  million , $9 million and $9 million for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively. All of the Company’s contributions areinvested in one or more funds a

Background
On
 January 9, 2014, a chemical storage tank owned by Freedom Industries, Inc. leaked two substances, 4-methylcyclohexane methanol (“MCHM”), andPPH/DiPPH,
 a mix of polyglycol ethers, into the Elk River near the West Virginia-American Water Company (“WVAWC”) treatment plant intake in Charleston,West
 Virginia. After having been alerted to the leak of MCHM by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, WVAWC took immediate steps togather
 more information about MCHM, augment its treatment process as a precaution, and begin consultations with federal, state and local public health officials.As
 soon as possible after it was determined that the augmented treatment process would not fully remove the MCHM, a joint decision was reached in consultationwith the West Virginia Bureau 
for Public Health to issue a “Do Not Use” order for all of its approximately 93,000 customer accounts in par ts of nine West Virginiacounties served by the Charles
ton treatment plant. By January 18, 2014, none of WVAWC’s customers were subject to the Do Not Use order.Following the Freedom Industries chemical spill, numerous law
suits were filed against WVAWC and certain other Company affiliated entities (collectively,the
 “American Water Defendants”) with respect to this matter in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia or West Virginia Circuit Courtsin
 Kanawha,  Boone  and  Putnam  counties,  and  to  date,  more  than 70 cases  remain  pending. Four of  the  cases  pending  before  the  U.S.  district  court  wereconsolidated
 for purposes of discovery, and an amended consolidated class action complaint for those cases (the “Federal action”) was filed in December 2014 byseveral plaintiffs. In January 2016, all of the then-filed state court cases were referred to West Virginia’s Mass Litigatio
n Panel for further proceedings, which havebeen
 stayed until April 22, 2018 pending the approval by the court in the Federal action of a global agreement to settle all of such cases, as described below. Thecourt in the Federal ac
tion has continued the start of the trial indefinitely pending ongoing settlement approval activities.Proposed
Global
Class
Action
Settlement
In
 October 2016, the court in the Federal action approved the preliminary principles, terms and conditions of a binding global agreement in principle tosettle claims
 among the American Water Defendants, and all class members, putative class members, claimants and potential claimants, arising out of the FreedomIndustries chemical
 spill. On April 27, 2017, the parties filed with the court in the Federal action a proposed settlement agreement providing details of the terms ofthe
 settlement of these matters and requesting that the court in the Federal action grant preliminary approval of such settlement. On July 6, 2017, the court in theFederal
 action issued an opinion denying without prejudice the joint motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement. On August 25, 2017, the parties filed aproposed amended settlem
ent agreement and related materials addressing the matters set forth in the July 6, 2017 order.On
 September  21,  2017,  the  court  in  the  Federal  action  issued  an  order  granting  preliminary  approval  of  a  settlement  class  and  proposed  class  actionsettlement
 (the “Settlement”) with respect to claims against the American Water Defendants by all putative class members (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) for allclaims
 and potential claims arising out of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. The Settlement proposes a global resolution of all federal and state litigation andpotential claims
 against the American Water Defendants and their insurers. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement and the proposed amended settlementagreement,
 the American Water Defendants have not admitted, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the Plaintiffs in any ofthe actions to be resolved. Under federal class action rules, claimant
s had the right, until December 8, 2017, to elect to opt out of the final Settlement, in which casesuch
 claimant would not receive any benefit from or be bound by the terms of the Settlement. As of January 31, 2018, less than 100 of the 225,000 estimated putative Plaintiffs hav
e submitted opt-out notices. The deadline to file a claim in the Settlement is February 21, 2018.117

Table of ContentsThe
 proposed aggregate pre-tax amount of the Settlement with respect to the Company is $126  million .  The aggregate portion of the Settlement to becontributed by WVAWC, net of insuranc
e recoveries, is $43 million (approximately $26 million after-tax), taking into account the September 2017 settlement withone of
 the Company’s general liability insurance carriers discussed below. Another defendant to the Settlement is to contribute up to $25 million to the Settlement. Two
 of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers, which provide an aggregate of $50 million in  insurance coverage to the Company under these policies,had
 been originally requested to participate in the Settlement at the time of the initial filing of the binding agreement in principle with the court in the Federalaction,
 but did not agree to do so at that time. WVAWC filed a lawsuit against one of these carriers alleging that the carrier’s failure to agree to participate in theSettlement constituted
 a breach of contract. On September 19, 2017, the Company and the insurance carrier settled this lawsuit for $22 million , out of a maximum of 
$25 million in  potential coverage under the terms of the relevant policy, in exchange for a full release by the Company and WVAWC of all claims against theinsurance carrier related
 to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. WVAWC and the settling insurer have agreed to stay this litigation pending final approval of theSettlement.
 The  Company  and  WVAWC  continue  to  pursue  vigorously  their  rights  to  insurance  coverage  for  contributions  by  WVAWC  to  the  Settlement  inmandatory arbitration with
 the remaining non-participating carrier. This arbitration proceeding remains pending.The
 proposed Settlement would establish a two-tier settlement fund for the payment of claims, comprised of (i) a simple claim fund, which is also referredto
 as the “guaranteed fund,” of $76  million ,  of which $29  million will  be contributed by WVAWC, including insurance deductibles, and $47  million would  becontributed
 by two of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers, and (ii) an individual review claim fund of up to $50 million , of  which up to $14 million would be contributed by WVAWC and up to 
$36 million would be contributed by a number of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers. Separately, up to $25 million 
would  be contributed to the guaranteed fund by another defendant to the Settlement. If any final approval order by the court in the Federal action withrespect
 to the Settlement is appealed and such appeal would delay potential payment to claimants under the Settlement, WVAWC and the other defendant to theSettlement
 will contribute up to $50  million and $25 million ,  respectively, to the Settlement (not including, in the case of WVAWC, any contributions by theCompany’s
 general liability insurance carriers which would not be made until such time as a final, non-appealable order is issued) into an escrow account duringthe
 pendency of such appeals. For certain claims, WVAWC and the other defendant to the Settlement may, in lieu of these escrowed contributions, make advancepayments of such
 claims if agreed to by the parties. All administrative expenses of the Settlement and attorneys’ fees of class counsel related thereto would be paidfrom the funds designated to p
ay claims covered by the Settlement.As
 a result of these events, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a charge to earnings, net of insurance receivables, of $65  million ( $39million 
after-tax).  Additionally, in the third quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a benefit of $22  million ( $13 million after-tax)  as an additional insurancereceivable
 reflecting the settlement with the insurance carrier described above. The settlement amount of $126  million is  reflected in Accrued Liabilities and theoffsetting
 insurance receivables are reflected in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December  31, 2017 .  The Company intends to fundWVAWC’s
 contributions to the Settlement through existing sources of liquidity, although no contribution by WVAWC will be required unless and until the termsof
 the Settlement are finally approved by the court in the Federal action. Furthermore, under the terms of the Settlement, WVAWC has agreed that it will not seekrate
 recovery  from  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia  (the  “PSC”)  for  approximately $4  million in  direct  response  costs  expensed  in  2014  byWVAWC relating to the Freedom Indus
tries chemical spill as well as for amounts paid by WVAWC under the Settlement.The
 Company’s insurance policies operate under a layered structure where coverage is generally provided in the upper layers after claims have exhaustedlower layers
 of coverage. The $36 million to  be contributed by a number of the Company’s general liability insurance carriers to the individual review claim fund,as
 noted above, is from higher layers of the insurance structure than the insurance carrier that was requested, but presently has not agreed, to participate in theSettlement.
 Any  recovery  by  WVAWC  or  the  Company  from  the  remaining  non-participating  carrier  would  reimburse  WVAWC  for  its  contributions  to  theguaranteed fund.
Notice
 of the terms of the Settlement to members of the settlement class commenced on October 11, 2017. Following the notice period, on January 9, 2018,the
 court in the Federal action held a fairness hearing to consider final approval of the Settlement, which was continued on February 1, 2018 to address certainopen
 matters. At this hearing, the court in the Federal action indicated that it intended to enter an order approving the Settlement, and the parties submitted aproposed order to the court on Febru
ary 2, 2018.Other

Proceedings
Additionally,
 investigations with respect to the matter have been initiated by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (the “CSB”), theU.S.
 Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia, the West Virginia Attorney General, and the PSC. As a result of the U.S. Attorney’s Officeinvestigation,
 Freedom Industries and six former Freedom Industries employees (three of whom also were former owners of Freedom Industries), pled guilty toviolations of the feder
al Clean Water Act. Moreover, the PSC issued an order on June 15, 2017 concluding its investigation without requiring WVAWC to take anyfurther action with respect
 to the matters covered by the general investigation.118

Table of ContentsThe
 CSB  is  an  independent  investigatory  agency  with  no  regulatory  mandate  or  ability  to  issue  fines  or  citations;  rather,  the  CSB  can  only  issuerecommendations
 for further action. In response to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, the CSB commenced an investigation shortly thereafter. In September2016,
 the CSB issued and adopted its investigation report in which it recommended that the Company conduct additional source water protection activities. OnApril
 4,  2017,  the  CSB  indicated  that  the  implementation  by  the  Company  of  source  water  protection  activities  resolved  the  first  two  parts  of  the  CSB’srecommendation.
 The  CSB  also  noted  that  compliance  by  the  Company  with  the  third  part  of  its  recommendation  is  ongoing  and  that  closure  of  this  part  iscontingent
 upon completion of updated contingency planning for the Company’s water utilities outside of West Virginia. In light of public response to its originalSeptember
 2016 investigation report, on May 11, 2017, the CSB issued a new version of this report. The primary substantive change addressed CSB’s factualevaluation
 of the duration and volume of contamination from the leaking tank, decreasing its estimate of the leak time but increasing the volume estimate by 10%.No
 substantive changes were made to the conclusions and recommendations in the original report. The Company has submitted an updated report on contingencyplanning and is awaiting CSB’s further 
review.On
 March  16,  2017,  the  Lincoln  County  (West  Virginia)  Commission  (the  “LCC”)  passed  a  county  ordinance  entitled  the  “Lincoln  County,  WVComprehensive
 Public Nuisance Investigation and Abatement Ordinance.” The ordinance establishes a mechanism that Lincoln County believes will allow it topursue
 criminal or civil proceedings for the “public nuisance” it alleges was caused by the Freedom Industries chemical spill. On April 20, 2017, the LCC filed acomplaint
 in  Lincoln  County  state  court  against  WVAWC  and  certain  other  defendants  not  affiliated  with  the  Company,  alleging  that  the  Freedom  Industrieschemical
 spill  caused  a  public  nuisance  in  Lincoln  County.  The  complaint  seeks  an  injunction  against  WVAWC  that  would  require  the  creation  of  variousdatabases and
 public repositories of documents related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, as well as further study and risk assessments regarding the allegedexposure
 of Lincoln County residents to the released chemicals. On June 12, 2017, the Mass Litigation Panel entered an order granting a motion to transfer thiscase
 to its jurisdiction and stayed the case consistent with the existing stay order. The LCC has elected to opt out of the Settlement. On January 26, 2018, the LCCfiled
 a motion seeking to lift the stay imposed by the Mass Litigation Panel. This motion is pending. WVAWC believes that this lawsuit is without merit andintends to vigorously contest th
e claims and allegations raised in the complaint.California Public Utilities Commiss
ion Residential Rate Design ProceedingIn
 December 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision in a proceeding involving California-American Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of theCompany
 (“Cal Am”), adopting a new residential rate design for Cal Am’s Monterey District. The decision allowed for recovery by Cal Am of $32  million in under-collections
 in  the  water  revenue  adjustment  mechanism/modified  cost  balancing  account  (“WRAM/MCBA”)  over  a five -year  period, plus interest, andmodified
 existing  conservation  and  rationing  plans.  In  its  decision,  the  CPUC  noted  concern  regarding  Cal  Am’s  residential  tariff  administration,  specificallyregarding
 the lack of verification of customer-provided information about the number of residents per household. This information was used for generating billingdeterminants
 under the tiered rate system. As a result, the CPUC kept this proceeding open to address several issues, including whether Cal Am’s residential tariffadministration viola
ted a statute, rule or CPUC decision, and if so, whether a penalty should be imposed.On
 February 24, 2017, Cal Am, the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District, the CPUC’s Office of Ratepayer Advocates, and the Coalition ofPeninsula
 Businesses filed for CPUC approval of a joint settlement agreement (the “Joint Settlement Agreement”), which among other things, proposed to resolvethe
 CPUC’s residential tariff administration concerns by providing for a waiver by Cal Am of $0.5  million of  cost recovery for residential customers through theWRAM/MCBA in lieu of a penalty. Approval of the Jo
int Settlement Agreement, which is required for it to take effect, remains pending before the CPUC.On
 March  28,  2017,  the  administrative  law  judge  assigned  to  the  proceeding  issued  a  ruling  stating  there  was  sufficient  evidence  to  conclude,  on  apreliminary basis, tha
t Cal Am’s administration of the residential tariff violated certain provisions of the California Public Utilities Code and a CPUC decision. Theruling ordered
 Cal Am to show cause why it should not be penalized for these administrative violations and directed the settling parties to address whether the costrecovery
 waiver  in  the  Joint  Settlement  Agreement  was  reasonable  compared  to  a  potential  penalty  range  described  by  the  administrative  law  judge.  Duringhearings
 held on April 13-14, 2017, the administrative law judge clarified that this potential penalty range is $3 million to $179 million (calculated as a continuing violation
 dating back to 2000 and applying penalties of up to $20,000 per  day until January 1, 2012 and penalties of up to $50,000 per  day thereafter, reflecting a2012 change to the relevant statute).
 The administrative law judge also noted that a per diem penalty may not be appropriate, as Cal Am’s monthly billing practicesdid
 not allow Cal Am to update customer-provided information for billing purposes on a daily basis. Hearings before the administrative law judge in this matterwere
 held in August, September and November 2017. Cal Am also submitted additional testimony on the issue of whether Cal Am should be penalized, and if so,the reasonable
 amount of any such penalty. This proceeding remains pending, and the CPUC has set a statutory deadline of September 30, 2018 for the completionof the proceeding.
As
 of December  31, 2017 ,  the portions of this loss contingency that are probable and/or reasonably possible have been determined to be immaterial to theCompany and have been included in th

Table of ContentsDunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On
 the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part ofWVAWC’s
 West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure to up to approximately25,000 
WVAWC  customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,2015, a
 second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of  the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by
 the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  wasreconfigured
 to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers  while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fullyrestored on July 1, 2015 to all custo
mers affected by this event.On
 June 2, 2017, a class action complaint was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County against WVAWC on behalf of a purported class ofresidents
 and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC forfailure
 to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenanceand operation of
 the water system. The plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss ofuse, as well as punitive damag
es for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.On
 October 12, 2017, WVAWC filed with the court a motion seeking to dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ counts alleging statutory and common law tort claims.Furthermore,
 WVAWC asserts that the PSC, and not the court, has primary jurisdiction over allegations involving violations of the applicable tariff, the publicutility code and rela
ted rules. This motion remains pending.The
 Company  and  WVAWC  believe  that  WVAWC  has  valid,  meritorious  defenses  to  the  claims  raised  in  this  class  action  complaint.  WVAWC  isvigorously
 defending  itself  against  these  allegations.  Given  the  current  stage  of  this  proceeding,  the  Company  cannot  reasonably  estimate  the  amount  of  anyreasonably possible losses or a 
range of such losses related to this proceeding.Note 16: Earnings per Common Share

The following methods and assumptions we
re used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:Current
 assets and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, includingrevolving credit debt, 
due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.120

Table of ContentsPreferred
 stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirementsand
 long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of long-term debtclassified as Level
 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valuedusing
 observable  and  unobservable  inputs.  The  fair  values  of  instruments  classified  as  Level  2  and  3  are  determined  by  a  valuation  model  that  is  based  on  aconventional
 discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market rates. As a majority of the Company’s debts do not trade in activemarkets, the Company calculated
 a base yield curve using a risk-free rate (a U.S. Treasury securities yield curve) plus a credit spread that is based on the followingtwo
 factors: an average of the Company’s own publicly-traded debt securities and the current market rates for U.S. Utility A debt securities. The Company usedthese
 yield curve assumptions to derive a base yield for the Level 2 and Level 3 securities. Additionally, the Company adjusted the base yield for specific featuresof the debt securities incl
uding call features, coupon tax treatment and collateral for the Level 3 instruments.The
 carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting and a fair value adjustment related to theCompany’s
 interest rate swap fair value hedge (which is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy), and fair values of the financial instruments were asfollows:

To
 increase  consistency  and  comparability  in  fair  value  measurements,  GAAP  establishes  a  fair  value  hierarchy  that  prioritizes  the  inputs  to  valuationtechniques used to measure 
fair value into three levels as follows:•
Level  1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reportingdate.
 Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs  include  active  exchange-traded  equity  securities,  exchange-based  derivatives,  mutualfunds and money market funds.
•
Level 2—inputs other than quoted prices included withi n Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable throughcorroboration
 with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, comm
ingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.•
Level  3—unobservable inputs, such as internally-developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset orliability.
 Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  3  inputs  include  infrequently-traded  non-exchange-based  derivatives  and  commingledinvestment funds subject to pu
rchase and sale restrictions.121

 derivative  asset  and  liability—The  Company  utilizes  fixed-to-floating  interest-rate  swaps,  typically  designated  as  fair-value  hedges,  toachieve
 a targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt. The Company also employs derivative financial instruments in the form of variable-to-fixed
 interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps, classified as economic hedges and cash flow hedges, respectively, in order to fix the interest coston
 existing  or  forecasted  debt.  The  Company  uses  a  calculation  of  future  cash  inflows  and  estimated  future  outflows,  which  are  discounted,  to  determine  thecurrent fair value. Additi
onal inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility.Other

The
 Company has entered into operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Rental expenses under operating leases were $29  million , $24million 
and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The operating leases for  facilities will expire over the next 25 yearsand the operating leases 
for equipment will expire over the next 5 years. Certain operating leases have renewal options ranging from one to five years.The
 minimum annual future rental commitment under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms over the next 5 years andthereafter are as follows:

 Company has a series of agreements with various public entities (the “Partners”) to establish certain joint ventures, commonly referred to as “public-private
 partnerships.” Under the public-private partnerships, the Company constructed utility plant, financed by the Company and the Partners constructed utilityplant
 (connected to the Company’s property), financed by the Partners. The Company agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to thePartners
 in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”), issued by the Partners under a state Industrial Development Bondand Commercial Developmen
t Act. The Company leased back the total facilities, including portions funded by both the Company and the Partners, under leases fora period of 
40 years.The
 leases related to the portion of the facilities funded by the Company have required payments from the Company to the Partners that approximate thepayments
 required  by  the  terms  of  the  IDBs  from  the  Partners  to  the  Company  (as  the  holder  of  the  IDBs).  As  the  ownership  of  the  portion  of  the  facilitiesconstructed by the Company will r
evert back to the Company at the end of the lease, the Company has recorded these as capital leases. The lease obligation and thereceivable
 for  the  principal  amount  of  the  IDBs  are  presented  by  the  Company  on  a  net  basis.  The  carrying  value  of  the  facilities  funded  by  the  Companyrecognized
 as a capital lease asset was $150  million and $152 million as  of December  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively, which is presented in property, plant andequipment
 in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The future payments under the lease obligations are equal to and offset by the payments receivableunder the IDBs.
As of 
December  31, 2017 ,  the minimum annual future rental commitment under the operating leases for the portion of the facilities funded by the Partnersthat
 have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year included in the preceding minimum annual rental commitments are $4  million in 2018

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREE MENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURENone
ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The
 Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,conducted
 an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under th
e Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.Based
 on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December  31, 2017 ,  our disclosure controlsand
 procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that theinformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Excha
nge Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods specified in the
 SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officerand the Chief Financial Offi
cer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Report
ingOur management is responsible for
 establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)of
 the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial Officer
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes inaccordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain tothe
 maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurancethat
 transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and thatour
 receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assuranceregarding prevention or t
imely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Our
 management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financialreporting,
 as of December  31, 2017 ,  using the criteria described in Internal 
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 issued  by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Com
mission (COSO).Based on our evaluation under the 
framework in Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 , our management concluded that our internal control overfinancial reporting was 
effective as of December 31, 2017 . The
 effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of December  31,  2017 has  been  audited  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  anindependent
 registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item  8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K 
. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
 were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely tomaterially affect, our internal contr
ol over financial reporting.ITEM 9B.
OTHER INFORMATION Changes to Long-Term Equity Award Retirement Provisions
On
 February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors and Executive Development and Compensation Committee approved changes to the retirement provisions ofequity awards granted under the Company’s 201
7 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”) to persons serving as the Company’s Chief ExecutiveOfficer,
 Chief Financial Officer or Chief Operating Officer (each, a “Covered Executive”), so long as the Covered Executive has held one or more of those titles(or any other title that co
ntains such title) for a period of at least three years of consecutive service.126


Table of ContentsThese changes acknowledge that 
these three positions consistently make and/or should make decisions that are in both the short-term and long-term interestsof
 the Company, and extend the vesting of equity awards beyond the Covered Executive’s retirement date to reflect the desired accountability. The changes applyto awards that
 are granted or may be granted to a Covered Executive under the Omnibus Plan commencing on February 14, 2018. These changes did not affect anyequity award granted under th
e Omnibus Plan prior to February 14, 2018.Except
 as  contemplated  by  the  amended  retirement  provisions,  the  Company  will  not  permit  the acceleration  of  vesting  of  any long-term  equity  awardgranted
 under the Omnibus Plan on account of retirement of a Covered Executive. With respect to a Covered Executive, the amended retirement provisions for along-term equity award state that such
 award will continue to vest over the normal vesting schedule of the award after the Covered Executive has a separation fromservice
 based upon either normal retirement or early retirement. In the event of a normal retirement of a Covered Executive, defined as having attained age 60 andfive
 years  of  service  with  the  Company  or  any  subsidiary,  an  award  will  vest  in  full  over  the  normal  vesting  schedule  of  the  award.  In  the  event  of  an  earlyretirement
 of a Covered Executive, defined as having attained age 55 and five years of service with the Company or any subsidiary, 75% of each award will vestover
 the normal vesting schedule of the award. Performance stock unit awards will continue to vest in accordance with their normal vesting schedule and shall bepaid
 at the end of the three-year performance period based on actual performance. Any stock option granted after February 14, 2018 to a Covered Executive willremain exercisable for a period
 of two years after the retirement date.127
