our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value; 
• our  expectation that, on a constant currency basis, our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expectedgrowth

• our  belief that our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (SaaS and IaaS, respectively, and collectively, OracleCloud
 Services) offerings are opportunities for us to expand our cloud and license business, and that we are in the early stages of what weexpect
 will  be  a  material  migration  of  our  existing  Oracle  customer  base  from  on-premise  applications  and  infrastructure  products  andservices to the Oracle Cloud;
 
• our  belief  that  we  can  market  our  SaaS  and  IaaS  services  to  a  broader  ecosystem  of  small and  medium-sized  businesses,  non-IT  lines  ofbusiness
 purchasers,  developers  and  partners  due  to  the  highly  available,  intuitive  design,  low  touch  and  low  cost  characteristics  of  theOracle Cloud;
 
• our expectation that substantially all  of our customers will renew their license support contracts annually; 
• our  belief that Oracle Fusion Cloud ErP is a strategic suite of applications that is foundational to facilitate and extract more business valueout

• our  expectations regarding the Oracle Autonomous Database to deliver rapid insights and innovation to our customers while also reducingcustomer downtime and cost;

l operating margins in future periods; 
• our  expectation  that  our  hardware  business  will  have  lower  operating  margins  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  than  our  cloud  and  licensebusiness;

will continue to increase ;  
• the  sufficiency  of  our  sources  of  funding  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  contractual  obligations,  acquisitions,  dividends,  stockrepurchases, debt repayments and other matters;

 the final outcome of our tax-related examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results ofoperations, and our belief that our net deferred tax assets 
will likely be realized in the foreseeable future; 
• our belief that the outcome  of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result inlosses that are materiall
y in excess of amounts already recognized, if any; 
• the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we  are a party could have a material impact on our financial position, future cash flowsand results of operations;
 
• the possibility that we may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans; 
• declarations  of future cash dividend payments and the timing and amount of future stock repurchases, including our expectation that thelevels
 of  our  future  stock  repurchase  activity  may  be  modified  in  comparison  to  past  periods  in  order  to  use  available  cash  for  otherpurposes;
 
• our expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements;  
• our  expectation  that,  to  the  extent  customers  renew  support  contracts  or  cloud  SaaS  and  IaaS  contracts  from  companies  that  we  haveacquired, we will recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over
 the respective renewal periods; 
• our ability to predict revenues, particularly certain cloud l icense and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues;

PART I
Item 1.
Business Oracle
 provides  products  and  services  that  address  enterprise  information technology  (IT)  environments.  Our  products  and  services  include  applications  andinfrastructure
 offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premisedeployments, cloud-based deployments, and hybrid
 deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployment) such as our OracleCloud@Customer
 offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer’s  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our  customers  andfacilitate
 the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, governmentagencies,
 educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle PartnerNetwork.
 Using  Oracle  technologies,  our  customers  build,  deploy,  run,  manage  and  support  their  internal  and  external  products,  services  and  businessoperations
 including, for example, a global cloud application supplier that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to provide its Software-as-a-Service
 (SaaS)  offerings;  a  multi-national  financial  institution  that  runs  its  banking  applications  using  the  Oracle  Exadata  Database  Machine;  and  a  globalconsumer
 products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise resource Planning for its accounting processes, consolidation and financial planningfunctions.
Oracle
 Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  include  Oracle  SaaS  and  Oracle  IaaS  offerings,  provide  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  stack  of  applications  andinfrastructure
 services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models.  Oracle  Cloud  Services  integrate  the  software,  hardware  and  services  on  a  customer’sbehalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer.
Oracle
 Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easilymaintainable
 to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibilitybetween
 IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfrontcustomer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable.
Oracle
 cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle  Middleware  software  offerings,among
 others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially allcustomers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.
Oracle
 hardware  products  include  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage  and  industry-specific  products,  among  others.  Customers  generally  opt  topurchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.
Oracle also offers services to
 assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.Providing choice
 and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important elementof
 our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications andinfrastructure
 technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewerofferings, more restrictive deployment models and less flex
ibility for a customer’s transition to cloud-based IT environments.Our
 investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware andservices
 businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we invested $6.5 billion,$6.1
 billion  and  $6.0  billion,  respectively,  in  research  and  development  to  enhance  our  existing  portfolio  of  offerings  and  products  and  to  develop  newtechnologies
 and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another. Wefocus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effec
tiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors;facilitating
 the ease with which organizations are able to deploy, use, manage and maintain our offerings; and incorporating emerging technologies within ourofferings to enable leaner business processes,

automation
 and innovation. For example, the Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure through an Oracle Cloud IaaSoffering
 that utilizes Oracle’s Next-Generation Cloud Infrastructure’s machine learning capabilities. After an initial purchase of Oracle products and services, ourcustomers can continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support
offerings
 for their license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewingtheir Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us
. Our
 selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products andservices that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale
 to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increasestockholder
 value.  We  have  invested  billions  of  dollars  over  time  to  acquire  a  number  of  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies  that  add  to,  arecomplementary
 to,  or  have  otherwise  enhanced  our  existing  offerings.  We  expect  to  continue  to  acquire  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies  tofurther our corporate strategy.
We
 have three businesses, each of which is comprised of a single operating segment. Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andresults
 of Operations and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both included elsewhere in this Annual report, provide additional informationrelated to our businesses and operating segments.
Oracle Corporation was incorporated 
in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on 
Oracle’s BusinessOracle
 is committed to the health, safety and welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers,  communities, stockholders and  other stakeholders. While theworld
 continues to navigate the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed to providing critical technologies, programsand
 support to individuals and organizations to navigate, adjust and advance their operations in light of the unique demands and constraints imposed by thepandemic.
 Many  enterprises,  governments  and  educational  institutions  have  faced  unprecedented  disruption  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  theircustomers
 expect  to  deal  with  organizations  in  digital  ways  more  than  ever  before.  Organizations  have  been  required  to  adjust  their  operations  and  ITinfrastructur
es to operate safely while agilely responding to evolving purchaser needs and business requirements. Organizations have turned to the Oracle Cloudto
 accelerate their digital transformations using applications and infrastructure technologies that are designed to be complete, current, and robust in order tosafely and securely operate, safeguard and advance their business initiatives. regardless 
of IT deployment model, Oracle has developed, delivered and supportedproducts
 and  services  for  decades  that  enable  telecommunication  companies  to  keep  people  connected;  retailers  to  provide  food  and  other  necessities;researchers to identify solutions; hospitals t
o provide care; airlines to ensure travel; banks to help people access funds; insurers to provide benefits; governmentsto keep people safe and informed; utilities t
o supply power and water; and many other critical functions.We
 have  proactively  sought,  supported,  donated  to,  partnered  and  engaged  with  organizations  globally  that  provide  critical  medicines,  research,  goods  andservices to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including:
 
•medical research organizations, which power COVID-19 simulati on and modeling projects using Oracle Cloud IaaS;   
•the  U.S. federal government, which received Oracle’s National Electronic Health records Cloud and Oracle’s Public Health Management ApplicationsSuite to help public health agencies collect and analyze inform
ation related to COVID-19 and track any adverse effects related to COVID-19 vaccines; 
•national  governments of several African countries, which are receiving systems and services to manage public health vaccination programs, throughour work with the Tony Blair
 Institute; 
•hospitals,  which  have  utilized  Oracle  infrastructure  technologies  to  rapidly  develop  and  deploy  applications  that  collect,  analyze  and  managecharacteristics of COVID-19 patients;

•e nterprises, which,  at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Oracle permitted  at  no additional charge to access Oracle Fusion Cloud Human CapitalManagement (HCM) options for employee health and safety programs in order to proactively manage and respond to COVID-19 implications on their
workforces
;  
•state  and local government agencies, which have utilized Oracle Cloud SaaS solutions to develop and target constituent outreach related to COVID-19, and to assess, research and respond to COVID-19 incident management on a unified platform; and
 
•pharmaceutical companies, which power their research and clinical trials using Or acle Health Sciences solutions;among
 dozens of other specific use cases, programs and partnerships that Oracle has donated to, partnered with, developed and supported in response to theCOVID-19 pandemic.
Oracle applicati
ons and infrastructure technologies are critical to the business operations of our customers, which number in the hundreds of thousands across abroad geographic
 and industry base. We are profitable and generate a large amount of positive cash flow from our operations and we do not believe the COVID-19 pandemic will jeopardize either of these characteristics of 
our business. Other impacts due to COVID-19 on our business are currently unknown.For
 additional discussion regarding the impacts and risks to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A risk Factors and Item 7 Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and results of Operations included elsewhere in this Annual report on Form 10-K.Oracle Applications and Infrastructure Technologies
Oracle’s
 comprehensive  portfolio  of  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  is  designed  to  address  an  organization’s  IT  environment  needs  includingbusiness
 process,  infrastructure  and  applications  development  requirements,  among  others.  Oracle  technologies  are  based  upon  industry  standards  and  aredesigned
 to be enterprise-grade, reliable, scalable and secure. Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies including database and middleware softwareas
 well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and services are the buildingblocks
 of  Oracle  Cloud  Services,  our  partners’  cloud  services,  and  our  customers’  cloud  IT  environments.  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  aremarketed
 and  sold  through  our  cloud  and  license,  hardware,  and  services  businesses  and  are  delivered  through  the  Oracle  Cloud,  or  through  other  ITdeployment
 models including cloud-based, hybrid and on-premise deployments. We believe Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings enable flexibility,interoperability and choice to best meet customer IT needs.
We believe that our Oracle Cloud Services offer
ings are opportunities for us to expand our cloud and license business. We believe that our customers increasinglyrecognize the
 value of access to the latest versions of Oracle cloud-based applications and infrastructure capabilities via a lower cost, rapidly deployable, flexibleand interoperable services model t
hat Oracle provisions, manages, upgrades and maintains on the customer’s behalf. We believe that we can market and sell ourOracle
 SaaS and IaaS offerings together to help new and existing customers migrate their extensive installed base of on-premise applications and infrastructuretechnologies
 to the Oracle Cloud and we believe we are in the early stages of what we expect will be a material migration of our existing Oracle customer basefrom on-premise applicati
ons and infrastructure products and services to the Oracle Cloud. In addition, we also believe we can market our SaaS and IaaS servicesto
 a broader ecosystem of small and medium-sized businesses, non-IT lines of business purchasers, developers and partners due to the highly available, intuitivedesign, low touch and low cost characteristics of the Oracle
 Cloud.In
 recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services deployment models hasincreased.
 To  address  customer  demand  and  enable  customer  choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers  to  pivot  their  applications  andinfrastructure
 licenses and license support contracts to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for theirexisting
 workloads. The proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, hardwarerevenues
 and services revenues has increased and represented 71%, 70% and 68% of our total revenues during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Weexpect these trends to continue.

 COVID-19  pandemic  changed  the  way  both  leaders  and  employees  think  about  where  and  how  they  work.  For  the  vast  majority  of  Oracle’s  employees,productivity
 is no longer tied to being in an office and collaboration can happen between people anywhere. In fiscal 2021 we announced a modern approach towork
 that gives our employees more flexibility to choose where and how to work. Depending on their role, this means that when our offices reopen after thepandemic,
 many employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all the time. We expect this modern approach towork will help us engage with a 
wider pool of talent and retain employees who want or need more flexibility.Tenure
We
 monitor employee turnover rates as our success depends upon retaining top talent. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed decreased turnover in theshort
 term and we believe that in the long term, we have an opportunity to continue to reduce undesirable turnover by offering competitive rewards, flexiblework options,
 career growth and development opportunities. The average tenure of our employees is approximately eight years and 29% of our employees havebeen employed with Oracle for ten or more
 years.Opportunities to Learn and Grow
We
 believe  that  a  primary  reason  candidates  join  Oracle  is  for  career  development  opportunities.  We  have  programs  and  resources  to  help  our  employeesexplore,
 build  and  achieve  their  career  goals.  We  also  promote  regular  career  conversations  between  leaders  and  employees.  These  are  separate  fromperformance
 feedback conversations and are focused on helping employees identify and take steps to grow their careers. Our Talent review process, run onOracle Fusion Cloud HCM, provides the mechanism for leade
rs to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees. 31% of our open non-entry level positions were fil
led internally in fiscal 2021, providing growth opportunities and retaining critical knowledge and talent.Helping
 our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining them and critical to our ability to innovate and rapidly evolve. We support employees withanytime,
 everywhere learning resources to help build skills for today and the future. Oracle employees received four million hours of training in fiscal 2021 andaccessed online learning content at an average rate of more
 than two million views per month. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we implemented a global workfrom
 home program and immediately pivoted to enable employees to continue learning from home. We moved in-person learning and development to onlineand
 our  employees  took  advantage  of  the  rich  content  available  to  help  them  enhance  their  skills.  In  addition  to  online  classes  and  learning  resources  onbusiness and technical skills, we also added more webinars 
and learning opportunities to support employee and family well-being.Making a Difference
Many
 of our employees participate in Oracle’s corporate citizenship initiatives focused on education, the environment and community. Each year, through ourvolunteering
 and giving programs, employees donate tens of thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars (matched by Oracle) to causes ranging fromequality and racial justice, to cleaning up oceans and mentoring students, to sharing their time and resources with people
 in need.Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our
 quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans,which
 are common in the IT industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest inour
 first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in particular, our cloud and license business and hardware business) are generally affected byseasonal
 factors in a similar manner as our revenues because certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See “Cloud andLicense Business” in Item 7 of this

Annual report for more information regarding the seasonality
 and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins. Competition
We
 face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firmsemerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise
 change.Our
 customers  are  demanding  less  complexity  and  lower  total  cost  in  the  implementation,  sourcing,  integration  and  ongoing  maintenance  of  their  ITenvironments.
 Our  enterprise  cloud,  license  and  hardware  offerings  compete  directly  with  certain  offerings  from  some  of  the  largest  and  most  competitivecompanies
 in  the  world,  including  Amazon.com,  Inc.,  Microsoft  Corporation,  International  Business  Machines  Corporation  (IBM),  Intel  Corporation,  CiscoSystems,
 Inc.,  Adobe  Systems  Incorporated,  Alphabet  Inc.  and  SAP  SE,  as  well  as  other  companies  like  Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise,  salesforce.com,  inc.  andWorkday,
 Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequentlyemerge
 to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providingpoint solutions, or
 offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increasedcompetition
 as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we havenot
 previously  competed.  Moreover,  we  or  our  competitors  may  take  certain  strategic  actions—including  acquisitions,  partnerships  and  joint  ventures,  orrepositioning of product lines—which invite even greater competition in one or m
ore product offering categories.Key
 competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance,scalabil
ity, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our products and services sales and therelative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are
 also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors: 
•market adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS and IaaS offerings; 
•the ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings; 
•compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our OracleCloud environments;
 
•the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; 
•the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft; 
•operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server, andother UNIX and Linux operating systems;
 
•the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; 
•products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; 
•products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and 
•the attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.For more information about the competitive r
isks we face, refer to Item 1A risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual report.Governmental Regulation
We operate globall
y and are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. For informationabout
 governmental  regulations  applicable  to  our  business,  refer  to  Item  1A  risk  Factors  and  Note  17  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  bothincluded elsewhere in this Annual report.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors We
 operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannotcontrol or predict. The following discussion, as wel
l as our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussion in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysisof
 Financial Condition and results of Operations, highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully considerthese risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.
Business and Operational Risks
The
 COVID-19  pandemic  has  affected  how  we  and  our  customers  are  operating  our  respective  businesses,  and  the  duration  and  extent  to  which  this  willimpact
 our future results of operations remains uncertain.   The COVID-19  pandemic  and efforts to control its spread  have materially affected  how we, ourcustomers,
 partners  and  suppliers  are  operating  our  businesses.  Our  operations  have  been  negatively  affected  by  a  range  of  external  factors  related  to  theCOVID-19
 pandemic that are not within our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement preventative measures to containor
 control further spread of the virus, such as travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place orders. These preventative measures led to
 sharp reductions in demand in certain industries in which our customers operate. It is not clear what long-termeffects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on
 our business, including the effects on our customers and prospects. If we are not able to respond to and manage theimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed.
During
 fiscal  2021,  we  cancelled  some  customer  events  and  transformed  others,  including  Oracle  OpenWorld,  to  virtual  events.  Our  shift  to  creating  virtualcustomer
 events may not be successful and we may not be able to showcase our products as well as we have historically done through in-person events, orgenerate
 the same customer interest, opportunities and leads through these virtual events. If we attempt to reintroduce large in-person events, we may not beable to do so successfully and our customers may not
 be able or willing to attend them.The
 conditions  caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  initially  adversely  affected  our  customers’  willingness  to  purchase  our  products,  delayed  prospectivecustomers’
 purchasing decisions and in certain cases, resulted in delayed payments by existing customers. There have also been, and likely will continue to be,delays
 in  our  supply  chain.  The  negative  impacts  of  the  global  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  broader  global  economy  and  related  impacts  on  our  customers’business
 operations and their demand for our products may continue into future fiscal periods. The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks describedin this risk Factors section.
Our
 success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products andservices.
   rapid  technological  advances,  intense  competition,  changing  delivery  models  and  evolving  standards  in  computer  hardware  and  softwaredevelopment
 and  communications  infrastructure,  changing  and  increasingly  sophisticated  customer  needs  and  frequent  new  product  introductions  andenhancements
 characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhanceand
 improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may notpurchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cl
oud subscriptions contracts. renewals of thesecontracts
 are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop newproducts will allow us to compete effective
ly for business opportunities in emerging areas.We
 have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly drivinginnovations
 in  technology  but  if  they  fail  to  operate  as  anticipated  or  our  other  products  do  not  perform  as  promised,  our  business  and  reputation  may  beharmed.
In addition, our business may be adversely affected if:
 
•we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;18

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
 
•infrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated; 
•we are unable to increase our existing data center capacity or establish data centers in new geographic locations in a timely manner to meet currentor expected customer demand;
 
•there is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new, enhanced or acquired product lines orservices;
 
•there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts; 
•we do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner; or 
•we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.Our
 Oracle  Cloud  strategy,  including  our  Oracle  Cloud  Software-as-a-Service  and  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (SaaS  and  IaaS,  respectively,  and  collectively,Oracle
 Cloud Services) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.   We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide viadeployment models that best suit their needs, including via our cloud-based SaaS and IaaS 
offerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not beable to compete effectively, ge
nerate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud andSaaS
 delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings. If we do not successfully executeour
 cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and ourrevenues and profitability could decline.
As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volat
ility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing ofrevenue
 recognition  between  our  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license,  and  hardware  product  arrangements  relative  to  our  cloud  offering  arrangements.Customers
 generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms ofthe
 subscriptions. Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidatedstatement of operations. This is in
 contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are generally recognized in full atthe
 time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transition from or be ableto
 sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of anddemand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profit
ability. We
 might  experience  significant  coding,  manufacturing  or  configuration  errors  in  our  cloud,  license  and  hardware  offerings.   Despite  testing  prior  to  therelease and throughout
 the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configurationerrors
 that  can  impact  their  function,  performance  and  security,  and  result  in  other  negative  consequences.  The  detection  and  correction  of  any  errors  inreleased
 cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability toproperly
 function,  integrate  or  operate  with  other  cloud,  license  or  hardware  offerings,  could  result  in  service  interruptions,  delays  or  outages  of  our  cloudofferings, could
 create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions ofproducts
 or  services,  and  could  adversely  affect  market  acceptance  of  our  products  or  services.  This  includes  third-party  software  products  or  servicesincorporated
 into our own. If we experience any of these errors, or if there are delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new versions ofthese
 offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s business operations as well as cloud and other services thatwe
 offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our and our customers’ abilities to conduct business operations andto
 ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs. Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, license and hardwareofferings
 and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services could expose us to productliability, performance and warranty cla
ims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.19

If
 we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.    We face intense competition in all aspectsof
 our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technologyevolves
 and as delivery models change. Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructuretechnologies
 including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence,compute,
 storage  and  networking  products,  among  others,  which  compete  with  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings.  Use  of  our  competitors’technologies
 influences  a  customer’s  purchasing  decision  or  creates  an  environment  that  makes  it  less  efficient  to  utilize  or  migrate  to  Oracle  products  andservices.
 Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may notgenerally
 find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose customers if our competitors introducenew competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more
flexible
 business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies. Mergers, consolidations or alliances among our competitors, or acquisitions of ourcompetitors
 by large companies, may result in increased competition. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in whichcompetitors may provide software and intel
lectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense. We
 may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.   The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and generaleconomic
 and  business  conditions  could  put  pressure  on  us  to  change  our  prices.  If  our  competitors  offer  deep  discounts  on  certain  products  or services  ordevelop
 products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings that are less favorable tous,
 or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operatingresults. Additiona
lly, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloudand
 license,  hardware  and  services  offerings,  and  we  may  also  incur  increased  cloud  delivery  expenses  as  we  expand  our  cloud  operations  and  update  ourinfrastructure,
 all  of  which  could  reduce  our  revenues  and/or  profitability.  Our  license  support  fees  and  hardware  support  fees  are  generally  priced  as  apercentage
 of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, whichcould put pressure on us to further discount our offerings.
Changes
 to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the newpricing
 policies.  Some  of  our  competitors  may  bundle  products  for  promotional  purposes  or  as  a  long-term  pricing  strategy,  commit  to  large  customerdeployments
 at  prices  that  are  unprofitable,  or  provide  guarantees  of  prices  and  product  implementations.  These  practices  could,  over  time,  significantlyconstrain
 the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products orchanges in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us t
o change our pricing models.Any failure to offer high-quality technical suppo
rt services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.   Our customers depend
 on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respond quicklyenough
 to  accommodate  short-term  increases  in  customer  demand  for  support  services  or  may  be  inefficient  in  our  resolution  of  customer  support  issues.Increased
 customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Any failure tomaintain
 high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our reputation,our ability to sell and renew
 our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financialposition.
Our
 cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, the results of these businesses will suffer. Wedepend
 on  suppliers  to  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  on  a  timely  basis  the  necessary  technologies  and  components  for  our  hardware  products  that  wemarket
 and  sell  to  our  customers  and  that  we  use  as  a  part  of  our  cloud  infrastructure  to  deliver  our  cloud  offerings,  and  there  are  some  technologies  andcomponents that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology,
20

availability
 or  other  business  constraints.  As  a  result,  our  supply  chain  operations  could  be  disrupted  or  negatively  impacted  by  industry  consolidation  andcomponent
 constraints  or  shortages,  natural  disasters,  political  unrest,  public  health  crises  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  changes  to  trade  policies,  portstoppages
 or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendorsare located or
 where the products are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or mayexperience
 significant shortages, delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If one or moreof
 the  risks  described  above  occurs,  our  cloud  and  license  business  and  hardware  business  and  related  operating  results  could  be  materially  and  adverselyaffected
. We
 are  susceptible  to  third-party  manufacturing  and  logistics  delays,  which  could  result  in  the  loss  of  sales  and  customers.   We  outsource  a  significantmajority of our manufacturing,
 assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products to a variety of companies, manyof
 which are located outside the U.S. From time to time, these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products. Toreduce
 this  risk,  we  continue  to  explore  additional  third-party  manufacturing  partners  to  drive  supply  chain  continuity,  but  finding  additional  manufacturingsources
 in a timely and cost-effective manner is difficult. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused a loss ofsales during our fiscal 2021.
 Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in ourhardware
 products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges couldarise if we alter our m
anufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.Our
 hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.   Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues andoverall
 profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardwarebusiness in a timely manner or at a
ll due to a number of factors, including: 
•changes in our hardware offerings, technologies and strategies, including shifting factory locations, which could adversely affect supply and demandfor our hardware products;
 
•our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and license business; 
•our  focus  on  certain  of  our  more  profitable  Oracle  Engineered  Systems  and  certain  other  hardware  products  we  consider  strategic  and  the  de-emphasis of certain of our lower prof
it margin commodity hardware products, which could adversely affect our hardware revenues; 
•changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products that couldadversely affect our hardware revenues;
 
•general supply chain material shortages worldwide, which were further exacerbated globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
•a  greater  risk  of  material  charges  that  could  adversely  affect  our  operating  results,  such  as  potential  write-downs  and  impairments  of  ourinventories;
 higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses; and amortization and potentialimpairment of intangible assets associated w
ith our hardware business; and 
•decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives, which could adversely affectour hardware revenues.
Our
 periodic  workforce  restructurings  and  reorganizations  can  be  disruptive.   We  are  currently  restructuring  our  workforce  and  in  the  past  we  haverestructured
 or  made  other  adjustments  to  our  workforce  in  response  to  management  changes,  product  changes,  performance  issues,  change  in  strategies,acquisitions
 and other internal and external considerations. These types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reducedproductivity
 while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resourceredeployment or cost savings benefits of these
21

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
restructurings,
 or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings andour revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected
. We
 may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.   We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of oursenior
 management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other members of ourexecutive
 team;  and  other  key  employees.  In  the  technology  industry,  there  is  substantial  and  continuous  competition  for  highly  skilled  business,  productdevelopment,
 technical and other personnel. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of our employees, we have temporarily closed themajority of
 our offices. In fiscal 2021, we moved our headquarters to Austin, Texas and announced a modern approach to work that may provide our employeesmore
 flexibility  to  choose  where  and  how  to  work.  Depending  on  their  role,  this  means  that,  when  our  offices  reopen  after  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  manyemployees
 can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all the time. While we believe this may help us engage with a widerpool of
 talent and may help to retain employees who want or need more flexibility, it could negatively impact employee productivity and it may present risks forour
 real estate portfolio and strategy. We intend to reopen our offices when it is safe to do so and local requirements allow, but our employees who opt toreturn to the office may nevertheless be exposed to health risks, 
which may expose us to potential liability.We may also experience increased compen
sation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruitingnew personnel
 and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreementswith
 our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there willnot be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operati
ons.We
 continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available atlower
 costs.  When  we  make  adjustments  to  our  workforce,  we  may  incur  expenses  associated  with  workforce  reductions  that  delay  the  benefit  of  a  moreefficient
 workforce  structure.  We  may  also  experience  increased  competition  for  employees  in  these  countries  as  the  trend  toward  globalization  continues,which
 may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes toimmigration and labor law po
licies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.Our
 general  compensation  program  includes  restricted  stock  units  and  performance-based  equity,  which  are  important  tools  in  attracting  and  retainingemployees
 in  our industry.  If  our stock  price  performs  poorly,  it may adversely  affect  our ability to retain  or attract  employees.  We continually  evaluate  ourcompensation
 practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equityawards granted per employee an
d granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and theamount
 of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability toretain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.
Our
 cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results.   Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect channelnetwork
 is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integratorsand
 independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketingand
 sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channelparticipants
 were  to  deteriorate,  if  any  of  our  competitors  enter  into  strategic  relationships  with  or  acquire  a  significant  channel  participant,  if  the  financialcondition
 or  operations  of  our  channel  participants  were  to  weaken  or  if  the  level  of  demand  for  our  channel  participants’  products  and  services  were  todecrease. There can
 be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are notsuccessful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.

Acquisitions
 present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.    We continueto
 review and  consider  strategic acquisitions of  companies,  products,  services and  technologies. We have a  selective and  active acquisition  program and  weexpect
 to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy. risks we may facein connection with our 
acquisition program include :  
•our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; 
•we may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business; (2) entering new markets where we have no, orlimited,
 direct  prior  experience  or  where  competitors  may  have  stronger  market  positions;  or  (3)  retaining  key  personnel  from  the  acquiredcompanies;
 
•an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as weexpected,
 we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpayfor,
 or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating resultsand potentially cause impairment to assets that
 we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill; 
•our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  (1)  claims  or  liabilities  that  we  assume  from  an  acquired  company  ortechnology
 or that are otherwise related to an acquisition; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships that we assume from an acquired company, thetermination
 or  modification  of  which  may  be  costly  or  disruptive  to  our  business;  and  (3)  unfavorable  revenue  recognition  or  other  accountingtreatment as a result of an acquired company’s business practices;
 
•we  may  fail  to  identify  or  assess  the  magnitude  of  certain  liabilities,  shortcomings  or  other  circumstances  prior  to  acquiring  a  company  ortechnology;
 
•we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including (1) if a larger than predictednumber
 of  customers  decline  to  renew  their  contracts  with  the  acquired  company;  (2)  if  we  are  unable  to  sell  the  acquired  products  or  serviceofferings
 to  our customer  base;  (3) if acquired  customers  do not elect  to purchase  our  technologies due  to differing  business  practices; or  (4) ifcontract
 models utilized by an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues in a manner that is consistent with our current accountingpractices;
 
•we  may  have  difficulty  integrating  acquired  technologies,  products,  services  and  their  related  supply  chain  operations  with  our  existing  lines  ofbusiness and related infrastructures;
 
•we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced, delivered and supported differently,which could cause customer confusion and delays;
 
•we  may  incur  higher  than  anticipated  costs  (1)  to  support,  develop  and  deliver  acquired  products  or  services;  (2)  for  general  and  administrativefunctions that support new business models; or (3) to comply w
ith regulations applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than wehad anticipated;
 
•we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed onus by worker councils or similar bodies
 under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition; 
•we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all; 
•our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash; 
•we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition andwe may have to delay 
or not proceed with a substantial23

acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms; and 
•we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles, including arrangements that we may assume in an acquisition.
The
 occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly inthe case of a larger acquisition or sever
al concurrent acquisitions.Data Privacy, Security and Intell
ectual Property RisksIf
 our  security  measures  for  our  products  and  services  are  compromised  and  as  a  result,  our  data,  our  customers’  data  or  our  IT  systems  are  accessedimproperly,
 made  unavailable,  or  improperly  modified,  our  products  and  services  may  be  perceived  as  vulnerable,  our  brand  and  reputation  could  bedamaged, the
 IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, any of which could reduceour
 revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.   Our products and services, including Oracle CloudServices,
 store, retrieve, manipulate and manage third-party data, such as our customers’ information and data, as well as our own data. We have a reputationfor
 secure and reliable product offerings and related services, and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security ofour
 products, services and the internal and external data that we manage. Nonetheless, we believe that Oracle in particular is an attractive target for computerhackers
 and other bad actors because Oracle stores and processes large amounts of data, including in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data suchas
 health sciences, financial services, retail, hospitality and the government.  We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties(which
 may  include  individuals  or  groups  of  hackers  and  sophisticated  organizations,  such  as  state-sponsored  organizations,  nation  states  and  individualssponsored by them) to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilit
ies, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our orour customers’, partners’
 and suppliers’ software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. Successful attempts by one of these malicious actors canlead
 to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Attempts of this nature typically involve IT-related
 viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities ofnetworks, systems, products and services, create system disrupti
ons and cause shutdowns or denials of service. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently inducecustomers,
 partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access toour
 data, our customers’, suppliers’ or partners’ data or the IT systems of Oracle, our customers, suppliers or partners.  Our products and services, including ourOracle Cloud Services, may also be 
accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee, contractor or supplier error or malfeasance.If
 a cyber-attack or other security incident results in unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ or suppliers’ data, other external data, our owndata or our IT systems, or if the services we prov
ide to our customers are disrupted, or if our products or services are reported to have or are perceived as havingsecurity
 vulnerabilities, we could incur significant expenses and suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation. If our customers lose confidence in thesecurity
 and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to not be secure, they may decide to reduce or terminatetheir
 spend with us. In addition, cyber-attacks and other security incidents could lead to significant investigation and remediation costs, loss or destruction ofinformation,
 interruption of our operations, inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations andfinancial
 penalties, and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring. Ourremediati
on efforts may not be successful. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems, change frequently, grow morecomplex
 over time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to preventsuch
 techniques. Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internalsecurity controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats
24

emerge. In
 addition, we often experience increased activity of this nature during times of instability, including during the current COVID-19 pandemic when most of
 our employees are working from home, and our operations may be more susceptible to malfeasance due to operational changes instituted to comply withsafety, health
 and regulatory requirements, among others. We may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time afterthe security breach
. Our
 products  operate  in  conjunction  with  and  are  dependent  on  a  wide  variety  of  third-party  products,  components  and  services.  If  there  is  a  securityvulnerability
 in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction,reduced
 revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies,products,
 services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies,we may still inherit such risks when we
 integrate these companies within Oracle.Our
 business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation,legal
 requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection.   As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwidelaws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more
 complex, potential risks related to data collection and use withinour
 business will intensify. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the nearfuture interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a
 manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and dataproviders, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other informat
ion that is integral to certain services we provide.In
 the wake of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection regulation (GDPr), the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased,giving
 rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle, and if we are not deemed to be in compliance, couldresult
 in enforcement actions and/or fines. This is true in the U.S. where, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective in January2020,
 the U.S. Congress is considering several privacy bills at the federal level, and other state legislatures are considering privacy laws. regulators globally arealso
 imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. The GDPr, which became effective in May 2018, provides for monetary penalties of up to 4% of anorganization’s
 worldwide revenue. These penalties can be significant. For example, one European data protection regulator has fined a major U.S. technologycompany
 €50 million for its data handling practices. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues to fine companies on a regular basis for unfair and deceptivedata protection practices,
 and these fines may increase in size. The CCPA provides for statutory damages or fines on a per violation basis that could be very largein
 the  event  of  a  significant  data  security  breach  or  other  CCPA  violation.  Taken  together,  the  changes  in  laws  or  regulations  associated  with  the  enhancedprotection of personal and
 other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection, and our cost of providing our productsand
 services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although wehave
 implemented contracts, diligence programs, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be noassurance
 that our employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts, policies andprocedures.
 Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputationor influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that
 may limit our ability to provide certain products and services.We
 make  statements  about  our  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information  through  our  privacy  policy,  information  provided  on  our  website  and  pressstatements.
 Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, includinglaws
 and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations,could
 result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affectour business and harm our reputation.

Third
 parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.   
We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rightsand/or
 breach  of  our  agreements  with  them.  These  third  parties  include  entities  that  do  not  design,  manufacture,  or  distribute  products  or  services  or  thatacquire intellectual property for the sole purpose of moneti
zation through infringement assertions. We expect to continue to receive such claims as :  
•we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies; 
•the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; 
•the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; 
•the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and 
•non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments.responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:
 
•be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; 
•divert management’s time and attention from developing our business; 
•require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; 
•require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; 
•require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; 
•require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or 
•otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.We
 may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.   We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,controls and contractual commitments
 to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties maytry
 to copy or reverse engineer our products or otherwise use our intellectual property. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Any of our pending orfuture
 patent applications may not be issued with the claim scope we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level ofintellectual
 property  protection  as  U.S.  laws  and  courts.  If  we  cannot  protect  our  intellectual  property  against  unauthorized  copying  or  use,  or  othermisappropriation, we may not remain competit
ive.We
 may  not  receive  significant  revenues  from  our  current  research  and  development  efforts  for  several  years,  if  at  all.   Developing  our  various  productofferings
 is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of ourcorporate strategy
 is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities boththrough
 internal  investments  and  the  acquisition  of  intellectual  property  from  acquired  companies.  Accelerated  product  and  service  introductions  and  shortlifecycles
 require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases.We
 believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position.However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from
 these investments for several years, if at all.Legal and Regulatory Risks
Adverse
 litigation results could affect our business.   We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to ouroperations,
 and  can  divert  our  management’s  attention  away  from  running  our  core  business.  The  results  of  our  litigation  also  cannot  be  predicted  withcertainty. An adverse decision
26

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
could
 result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regardingcertain of the lawsuits we are 
involved in is discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report. We
 may be subjected to increased taxes due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws or from adverse resolutions of tax audits and controversies.   As amultinati
onal corporation, we incur income taxes as well as non-income based taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, property and value-added taxes) in both the U.S.and
 various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the application of the various taxes to the businesses in which we engage, oftenrequiring
 that we make judgments in determining our tax liabilities and worldwide provision for income taxes. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities inthe
 U.S. and internationally, which can lead to disagreements such as regarding our intercompany transfer prices and calculations and on the applicability ofwithholding taxes to our cross-border transactions. Any unfavorable
 resolution of these tax audits and controversies could cause our tax liabilities to increase andmay
 have a significant adverse impact on our provision for income taxes and tax rate. Although we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimatesare reasonab
le, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income taxprovisions and tax accruals.
Increasingly,
 countries  around  the  world  are  actively  considering  or  have  enacted  changes  in  relevant  tax,  accounting  and  other  laws,  regulations  andinterpretations.
 In the U.S., various proposals, if enacted, would dramatically raise the U.S. corporate tax rate and increase the tax on non-U.S. income. Suchunfavorabl
e tax legislation resulting from the shifting U.S. political landscape and economic environment create the potential for added volatility in our quarterlyprovision for income taxes and could have a
 significant adverse impact on our future income tax provision and tax rate.Other
 countries  also continue  to consider  changes  to their tax laws that could negatively affect us by increasing  taxes imposed  on our international  revenuestreams,
 operations and cross-border transactions, including the imposition of taxes targeted at digital technology businesses and changes in withholding taxregimes.
 More  fundamentally,  longstanding  international  tax  principles  that  determine  each  country’s  right  to  tax  cross-border  transactions  are  beingreconsidered, creating signif
icant uncertainty as to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operations. This re-examination of the global taxsystem
 is driven by a perceived need to provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located. Various measures are beingdiscussed,
 including  adjustments  to the  manner  in which  taxable profits are allocated among jurisdictions,  as  well as the  limitation of deductions  for,  or theimposition of additional w
ithholding taxes on, intercompany payments.The
 foregoing proposals to raise U.S. corporate income taxes in combination with the uncertain international tax environment have upended the predictabilityand reliability of
 the global tax system. Our future income tax provision and tax rate could significantly increase if such tax law changes are enacted in the U.S. orin
 countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions that have relativelylower
 statutory  tax rates  to  those  in  which  the  rates  are  relatively  higher.  In  addition,  changes  in  the  valuation  of our  deferred  tax  assets  or  liabilities  couldnegatively impact our income tax provisi
on.Our
 international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.   We derive a substantial portion of ourrevenues
 from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our internationaloperations
 increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, taxlaws,
 foreign currency-related regulations, competition regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as theU.S.
 Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (FCPA),  market  access  regulations,  tariffs,  and  import,  export  and  general  trade  regulations,  including  but  not  limited  toeconomic
 sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or ouremployees, and prohibitions on the
 conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability tooffer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or
 prevent potential acquisitions and could also27

materially
 damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operatingresults. 
These  laws can require suspension or termination of business, including financial transactions, in certain countries, territories or with certain customersand
 any such action in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with these laws also requires a significant
 amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management’s attention from running our business operations and could harm ourability to grow our business, or ma
y increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.Our
 success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate allegations ofimproprieties
 relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and reportour
 findings  to  government  authorities,  and  in  some  circumstances  such  authorities  conduct  their  own  investigations  and  we  respond  to  their  requests  ordemands for information. No assurance can be given that action wi
ll not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.We are also subject to a variety
 of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to: 
•general economic conditions in each country or region; 
•public health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; 
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results; 
•difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular ourcash assets, in that country’s currency;
 
•regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that mayunexpectedly
 impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required topay in these countries;
 
•political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; 
•common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies; 
•natural disasters; 
•the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity); 
•longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 
•overlapping tax regimes; and 
•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.The
 variety  of risks  and  challenges  listed  above  could  also disrupt  or otherwise  negatively  impact  our supply  chain  operations  and  sales of our  products  andservices in affected countries or regions.
As
 the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly tradedcompany
 in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that wewould otherwise have if these entities were
 wholly-owned subsidiaries.Our
 sales  to  government  clients  expose  us  to  business  volatility  and  risks,  including  government  budgeting  cycles  and  appropriations,  procurementregulations, governm
ental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits,28

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
investigations,
 sanctions and penalties.    We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governmentsand are subject to procurement laws relating to the award, administrat
ion and performance of those contracts. Governmental
 entities  are  variously  pursuing  policies  that  affect  our  ability  to  sell  our  products  and  services.  Changes  in  government  procurement  policy,priorities,
 regulations, technology initiatives and/or requirements may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector. For example, theU.S.
 government  imposes  evolving  cybersecurity  requirements,  including,  for  example,  the  FedrAMP  authorization  process  and  the  Department  of  Defense(DoD)
 Cybersecurity  Maturity  Model  Certification  (CMMC).   These  requirements  may  impact  our  lines  of  business  in  the  U.S.  federal  government  market.Compliance with
 these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly, and failure to meet, or delays in meeting, the required security controls could limit ourability
 to  sell  products  and  services,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  the  DoD  and  other  federal  and  state  government  entities  that  implement  similar  cybersecurityrequirements.
We
 are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time, without cause. Forexample,
 the  U.S.  federal  government  may  terminate  any  of  our  government  contracts  and  subcontracts  at  its  convenience,  or  for  default  based  on  ourperformance.
U.S. federal, state an
d local government and foreign government contracts are generally subject to government funding authorizations/appropriations. Contractsmay be terminated based upon a lack of government funds.
There
 is  increased  pressure  on  governments  and  their  agencies,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  to  reduce  spending  as  governments  continue  to  facesignificant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs.
Government
 contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If violations of law are found,they could
 result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture ofprofits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.
Environmental
 and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.   Some of our cloudand
 hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materialsused for these prod
ucts, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labelingrequirements.
 Compliance  with  these  ever-changing  environmental  and  other  laws  in  a  timely  manner  could  increase  our  product  design,  development,procurement,
 manufacturing,  delivery,  cloud  operations  and  administration  costs,  limit  our  ability  to  manage  excess  and  obsolete  non-compliant  inventory,change
 our  sales  activities,  or  otherwise  impact  future  financial  results  of  our  cloud  and  hardware  businesses.  Any  violation  of  these  laws  can  subject  us  tosignificant
 liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in amaterial
 adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses. regulatory, market, and competitive pressuresregarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations m
ay also grow.A
 significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on restriction of HazardousSubstances (roHS),
 the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for ControllingPollution
 Caused by Electronic Information Products, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenuesfrom
 the  EU,  China  and  other  countries  with  similar  environmental  legislation  as  we  endeavor  to  comply  with  and  implement  these  requirements.  The  UKGovernment has announced a procurement policy that includes environmental, social and economic sustainabilit
y measures.  The
 SEC  requires  public  disclosure  for  registrants  that  use  certain  “conflict  minerals”  in  their  products.  Our  supply  chain  is  multi-tiered,  global  and  highlycomplex.
 As a provider of hardware end-products, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supplychain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the or
igin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited.29

We
 have  an  Environmental  Steering  Committee  (ESC)  comprised  of  senior  individuals  from  a  wide  range  of  Oracle  business  units,  including  our  ChiefSustainabi
lity Officer who reports to our Chief Executive Officer and oversees our overall sustainability strategy, including climate related risk mitigation. The ESCevaluates
 if climate or environmental risks have the potential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core and/or strategic business functions, includingservice
 delivery  and  support,  product  development  and  deployment,  supply  chain  management,  facility  operations,  employee  recruitment  and  retention,  orbrand reputation. A failure by the ESC to identify and assess
 these risks could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth. We
 publish  an  annual  Corporate  Citizenship  report,  which  includes  disclosure  of  our  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  matters  and  goals.  Ourdisclosures
 on  these  matters,  and  standards  we  set  for  ourselves  or  a  failure  to  meet  these  standards,  may  potentially  harm  our  reputation  and  brand.  Byelecting to set and share publicly these corporate ESG standards, our business may
 also face increased scrutiny related to ESG activities.Financial Risks
Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly b
ased on a number of factors that make our results of operations difficult for us to predict.   Our revenues,
 particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. A substantial portion ofour
 cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter, and a significant percentage of these is comprised oflarger
 value  orders.  Because  a  significant  portion  of  our  cost  structure  is  largely  fixed  in  the  short  term,  sales  and  revenue  shortfalls  tend  to  have  adisproportionately
 negative  impact  on  our  profitability.  The  number  of  large  license  transactions  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  hardware  products  transactionsincreases
 the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenuesand
 profitability  to  fall  significantly  short  of  our  predictions.  In  addition,  sudden  shifts  in  regional  or  global  economic  activity,  such  as  what  we  experiencedinitially at the outset of
 the COVID-19 pandemic, may cause our sales forecasts to be inaccurate.We
 may  experience  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses.  Changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  can  adversely  affect  customer  demand  and  our  revenue  andprofitability.
   We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreigncurrencies,
 particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating resultsand cash flows, which
 are reported in U.S. Dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and mostother
 major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreigncurrency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of 
actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensivefor
 foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside ofthe U.S. Generally, our reported
 revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positivelyaffected
 when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as aportion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are
 held in foreign currencies and reported in U.S. Dollars.In
 addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and oursubsidiaries
 that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizesforeign
 currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time totime.
 As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset atleast
 in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currencytransaction
 gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses withrespect
 to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currencygains and
 losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or shouldwe suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized
30

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
loss
 or  gain  with  respect  to  currency  fluctuations  will  generally  depend  on  the  size  and  type  of  cross-currency  exposures  that  we  enter  into,  the  currencyexchange
 rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset theseexposures and
 any related fees paid to purchase such contracts, and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financialposition and cash flows
. We
 have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar. Wecould incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationar
y.There
 are  risks  associated  with  our  outstanding  and  future  indebtedness.   As  of  May  31,  2021,  we  had  an  aggregate  of  $84.2  billion  of  outstandingindebtedness
 that will mature between calendar year 2021 and calendar year 2061, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to payinterest
 and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to servicesuch debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able
 to manage any of these risks successfully.We
 may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that theterms
 of  any  refinancing  may  not  be  as  favorable  as  the  terms  of  our  existing  debt.  Furthermore,  if  prevailing  interest  rates  or  other  factors  at  the  time  ofrefinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.
Should we incur future
 increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited,which
 could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit ratingcould
 negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. Theserisks could adversely affect our financial condition 
and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Common Stock
Our
 stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.   All of the factors discussed within this risk Factors section could affect ourstock
 price. The  timing of announcements  in the public  market by us  or by our competitors regarding new cloud services,  products,  product  enhancements,technological
 advances,  acquisitions  or  major  transactions  could  also  affect  our  stock  price.  Changes  in  the  amounts  and  frequency  of  share  repurchases  ordividends
 could  affect  our  stock  price.  Our  stock  price  could  also  be  affected  by  factors,  some  of  which  are  beyond  our  control,  including,  among  others:speculation
 in the press, social media and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings related estimates by financial analysts, changes ininvestors’
 or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys, earnings announcements where our financial resultsdiffer
 from our guidance or investors’ expectations, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. The stock market in general, and themarket
 for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate tothe
 operating performance of those companies. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, whichcould result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.
We
 cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.   In fiscal 2021, ourBoard
 of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $20.0 billion. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date andwe are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or doll
ar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, evenif fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.

General Risks
Economic,
 political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth andprofitability
, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price.   Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we haveno comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:
 
•general economic and business conditions; 
•overall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services; 
•governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and 
•general legal, regulatory and political developments.Macroeconomic
 developments such as the global economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom leaving the EU (Brexit), evolvingtrade
 policies between the U.S. and international trade partners, or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability ineconomic,
 political or market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adverselyaffect
 our  stock  price.  Any  general  weakening  of,  and  related  declining  corporate  confidence  in,  the  global  economy  or  the  curtailment  of  government  orcorporate
 spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay,decrease or cancel pur
chases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.In
 addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for otherhostilities
 in  various  parts  of  the  world,  public  health  crises  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  natural  disasters  continue  to  contribute  to  a  climate  ofeconomic
 and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability.These factors
 generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and, to a lesser extent, alsomay affect our renewal rates for
 license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.Business disruptions
 could adversely affect our operating results.   A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographicareas,
 some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S.We
 are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providingservices, including
 some of our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes. A majorearthquake
 or fire, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change(such as
 increased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business, supply chains or IT systemscould severely affect our ability to
 conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  Results of OperationsWe begin
 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. Thisoverview
 is  followed  by  a  summary  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that  we  believe  are  important  to  understanding  the  assumptions  andjudgments
 incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal2021
 compared to fiscal 2020. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found inManagement’s
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal yearended
 May 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on June 22, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor relationswebsite at www.oracle.com/investor.
Business Overview
Oracle
 provides  products  and  services  that  address  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  environments.  Our  products  and  services  include  enterpriseapplications
 and  infrastructure  offerings  that  are  delivered  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and  interoperable  IT  deployment  models.  These  modelsinclude
 on-premise  deployments,  cloud‑ based  deployments,  and  hybrid  deployments  (an  approach  that  combines  both  on-premise  and  cloud‑ baseddeployment)
 such  as  our  Oracle  Cloud@Customer  offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer’s  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  andflexibility
 to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide salesforce
 and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions andresellers.
We
 have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as apart
 of this Item 7 and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in thisAnnual
 report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs),which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view 
our operating results and allocate resources.Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on 
Oracle’s BusinessFor a
 discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to “Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business” included inItem
 1  Business  in  this  Annual  report,  the  risks  included  in  Item  1A  risk  Factors  in  this  Annual  report  and  the  information  presented  below  in  “results  ofOperations” in this Item 7.
Cloud and License Business
Our
 cloud and license business, which represented 84% and 83% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broadspectrum
 of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. revenue streams included in our cloud and licensebusiness are:
 
•Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:  
o license  support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase supportservices
 in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other ITenvironments.
 Substantially  all  license  support  customers  renew  their  support  contracts  with  us  upon  expiration  in  order  to  continue  tobenefit
 from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license supportcustomers
 are  entitled  to  receive.  License  support  contracts  are  generally  priced  as  a  percentage  of  the  net  fees  paid  by  the  customer  topurchase
 a  cloud  license  and/or  on-premise  license;  are  generally  billed  in  advance  of  the  support  services  being  performed;  are  generallyrenewed at the customer’s option; and are generally
36

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
 
recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are  provided, which is generally one year;  and 
o cloud  services  revenues,  which  provide  customers  access  to  Oracle  Cloud  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  via  cloud-baseddeployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that
customers
 access  by entering  into a subscription  agreement  with us  for a stated period. Oracle Cloud  Services arrangements  are generallybilled
 in  advance  of  the  cloud  services  being  performed;  generally  have  durations  of  one  to  three  years;  are  generally  renewed  at  thecustomer’s
 option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usagemodel contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time.
 
•Cloud  license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications,Oracle
 Database,  Oracle  Middleware  and  Java,  among  others,  which  our  customers  deploy  within  cloud-based,  on-premise  and  other  ITenvironments.
 Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues upfront
 at  the  point  in  time  when  the  software  is  made  available  to  the  customer  to  download  and  use.  revenues  from  usage-based  royaltyarrangements
 for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. Thetiming
 of  a  few  large  license  transactions  can  substantially  affect  our  quarterly  license  revenues  due  to  the  point-in-time  nature  of  revenuerecognition
 for  license  transactions,  which  is  different  than  the  typical  revenue  recognition  pattern  for  our  cloud  services  and  license  supportrevenues
 in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have theoption to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.
Providing
 choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements ofour corporate strategy. In
 recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services hasincreased.
 To  address  customer  demand  and  enable  customer  choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers  to  pivot  their  applications  andinfrastructure
 licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for theirexisting
 workloads. The proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, hardwarerevenues and services revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services and
 license support revenues represented 71%, 70% and 68%of our total revenues during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our
 cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmentalbudgetary
 constraints;  the  strategy  for  and  competitive  position  of  our  offerings;  the  continued  renewal  of  our  cloud  services  and  license  support  customercontracts by
 the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases;the
 pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; ourability to manage Oracle C
loud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and l
icense revenues generally will continue to increase due to: 
•expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and 
•continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.We
 believe  these  factors  should  contribute  to  future  growth  in  our  cloud  and  license  business’  total revenues,  which  should  enable  us  to  continue  to  makeinvestments
 in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of ourcloud and license products and services.

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
Our 
cloud  and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historicalupward trend
 of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixedin
 the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year isprimarily
 due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratablyor
 based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms;  the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over thecourse of
 each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues ratably; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on- premise license revenues,which we generally recognize at a point 
in time upon delivery;  in each case over those four quarterly periods . Hardware Business
Our
 hardware  business,  which  represented  8%  and  9%  of  our  total  revenues  in  fiscal  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  provides  a  broad  selection  of  enterprisehardware
 products  and  hardware-related  software  products  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage,  industry-specific  hardware  offerings,operating
 systems,  virtualization,  management  and  other  hardware-related  software,  and  related  hardware  support.  Each  hardware  product  and  its  relatedsoftware, such as an operating system or firmw
are, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Therevenues
 for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  that  the  hardware  product  and  its  related  software  aredelivered
 to  the  customer  and  ownership  is  transferred  to  the  customer.  We  expect  to  make  investments  in  research  and  development  to  improve  existinghardware
 products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels,including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software
components
 that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware supportofferings can also include
 product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at theoption of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardw
are products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardwaresupport services are delivered over the contractual terms.
We
 generally  expect  our  hardware  business  to  have  lower  operating  margins  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  than  our  cloud  and  license  business  due  to  theincremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.
Our
 quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affectedby
 many factors, including our manufacturing partners’ abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and theposition
 of  our  hardware  products  relative  to  competitor  offerings;  customer  demand  for  competing  offerings,  including  cloud  infrastructure  offerings;  thestrength
 of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contractsat
 or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contractsand
 the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age;customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructu
re to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currencyrate fluctuations
. Services Business
Our
 services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2021 and 2020, helps customers and partners maximize the performance oftheir
 investments  in  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies.  We  believe  that  our  services  are  differentiated  based  on  our  focus  on  Oracletechnologies,
 extensive  experience,  broad  sets  of  intellectual  property  and  best  practices.  Our  services  offerings  include  consulting  services  and  advancedcustomer
 services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by manyfactors including our strategy for, and the
38

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
competitiv
e position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associat ed services for these offerings; generaleconomic
 conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionaryspending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations
. Acquisitions
Our selective and active acquisiti
on program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire anumber
 of  complementary  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies.  The  pace  of  our  acquisitions  has  slowed  in  recent  years,  but  as  compellingopportunities
 become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report provides additiona
l information related to our recent acquisitions.We
 believe  that  we  can  fund  our  future  acquisitions  with  our  internally  available  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities,  cash  generated  fromoperations,
 additional  borrowings  or  from  the  issuance  of  additional  securities.  We  estimate  the  financial  impact  of  any  potential  acquisition  with  regard  toearnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move f
orward with an acquisition.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
 consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  FinancialAccounting
 Standards Board’s Accounting  Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting  bulletins and  other applicable guidanceissued
 by  the  SEC.  GAAP,  as  set  forth  within  the  ASC,  requires  us  to  make  certain  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the  estimates,judgments
 and  assumptions  upon  which  we  rely  are  reasonable  based  upon  information  available  to  us  at  the  time  that  these  estimates,  judgments  andassumptions
 are made. These estimates, judgments  and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financialstatements
 as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between theseestimates,
 judgments  or  assumptions  and  actual  results,  our  financial  statements  will  be  affected.  The  accounting  policies  that  reflect  our  more  significantestimates,
 judgments  and  assumptions  and  which  we  believe  are  the  most  critical  to  aid  in  fully  understanding  and  evaluating  our  reported  financial  resultsinclude:
 
•revenue recognition;  
•Business Combinations;  
•Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments;  
•Accounting for Income Taxes; and  
•Legal and Other Contingencies. Our
 senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Note
 1  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  includes  additional  information  about  our  critical  and  otheraccounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
The
 most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606, Revenue  Recognition from Customers,  and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determinationof distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of
 the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation.Many
 of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within acustomer
 contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multipleproducts and services
39

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
contained
 within  a  customer  contract  are  generally  considered  to  be  distinct  and  are  not  combined  for  revenue  recognition  purposes.  We  allocate  thetransaction
 price for each customer contract to each performance obligation  based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for eachperformance oblig
ation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contractas revenue as each performance obligation is delivered.
We
 use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performanceobligati
ons except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separatelyin
 comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis orwhen
 facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced byintense
 competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses havenot
 historically  been  sold  on  a  standalone  basis,  as  substantially  all  customers  elect  to  purchase  license  support  contracts  at  the  time  of  a  license  purchase.License
 support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. We are unable to establish the SSPfor
 our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the sellingprice
 is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud licenseand
 an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby allother
 performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amountof transaction price allocated to cloud l
icense and on-premise license revenues. Business Combinations
We
 apply  the  provisions  of  ASC  805, Business  Combinations (ASC  805),  in  accounting  for  our  acquisitions.  ASC  805  requires  that  we  evaluate  whether  atransacti
on pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capableof
 being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisitionto
 the  individual  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  on  a  relative  fair  value  basis;  whereas  the  acquisition  of  a  business  requires  us  to  recognize  separately  fromgoodwill
 the  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  fair  values.  Goodwill  as  of  the  acquisition  date  is  measured  as  the  excess  ofconsideration
 transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates andassumptions
 to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, ourestimates
 are  inherently  uncertain  and  subject  to  refinement.  As  a  result,  during  the  measurement  period,  which  may  be  up  to  one  year  from  the  businessacquisition
 date,  we  record  adjustments  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  with  the  corresponding  offset  to  goodwill.  Upon  the  conclusion  of  abusiness
 acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequentadjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.
Accounting
 for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including ourestimates for
 intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although webelieve that the assumptions and estima
tes we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience andinformation
 obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur thatmay affect the accuracy or validity 
of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.For
 a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation ofthese
 pre-acquisition  contingencies  throughout  the  measurement  period  in  order  to  obtain  sufficient  information  to  assess  whether  we  include  thesecontingencies as a part of the fair value estim
ates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.40

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
If
 we  cannot  reasonably  determine  the  fair  value  of  a  non-income  tax  related  pre-acquisition  contingency  by  the  end  of  the  measurement  period,  which  isgenerally the
 case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or  a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an assetexisted
 or  a  liability  had  been  incurred  at  the  acquisition  date  and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Subsequent  to  themeasurement
 period  or  final  determination  of  the  net  asset  values  for  the  business  combination,  whichever  comes  first,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  suchcontingencies will affect earnings and could have a material
 effect on our results of operations and financial position. In
 addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. Wereevaluate
 these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimatesbeing
 recorded  to  goodwill  if  identified  within  the  measurement  period.  Subsequent  to  the  measurement  period  or  our  final  determination  of  the  taxallowance’s or contingency’s estimated value,
 whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect ourprovision for income taxes in our conso
lidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessme
ntsWe
 review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We makecertain
 judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each ofour reporting units.
Judgment in t
he assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, andother
 factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerations,  macroeconomic  conditions,  and  other  relevant  events  and  factors  affecting  thereporting unit.
 To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative testis then performed.
Performing
 a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test  includes  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  and  involves  significant  estimates  andassumptions.
 These  estimates  and  assumptions  include,  among  others,  revenue  growth  rates  and  operating  margins  used  to  calculate  projected  future  cashflows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate m
arket comparables.We
 make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairmentmay
 exist.  In  such  situations,  we  are  required  to  evaluate  whether  the  net  book  values  of  our  finite  lived  intangible  assets  are  recoverable.  We  determinewhether
 finite  lived  intangible  assets  are  recoverable  based  upon  the  forecasted  future  cash  flows  that  are  expected  to  be  generated  by  the  lowest  levelassociated
 asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective andinclude,
 among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by avariety
 of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internalforecasts.
Accounting for Income T
axesJudgment
 is  required  in  determining  our  worldwide  income  tax  provision.  In  the  ordinary  course  of  a  global  business,  there  are  many  transactions  andcalculations
 where  the  ultimate  tax  outcome  is  uncertain.  Some  of  these  uncertainties  arise  as  a  consequence  of  revenue  sharing  and  cost  reimbursementarrangements
 among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregationof
 foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of thesematters
 could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on ourincome tax provision and net income in the period in 
which such determination is made.41

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
We 
record  a  valuation  allowance  to  reduce  our  deferred  tax  assets  to  the  amount  that  is  more  likely  than  not  to  be  realized.  In  order  for  us  to  realize  ourdeferred
 tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider futuregrowth,
 forecasted earnings, future  taxable income,  the  mix of earnings  in the  jurisdictions  in which  we operate, historical earnings,  taxable income in prioryears,
 if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the eventwe
 were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assetsvaluation
 allowance  would  be  charged  to  earnings  in  the  period  in  which  we  make  such  a  determination,  or  goodwill  would  be  adjusted  at  our  finaldetermination
 of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that thenet
 deferred  tax  assets  would  be  realized,  we  would  reverse  the  applicable  portion  of  the  previously  provided  valuation  allowance  as  an  adjustment  to  ourprovision for income taxes at such 
time. We
 calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returnsfiled
 during  the  subsequent  year.  Adjustments  based  on  filed  returns  are  generally  recorded  in  the  period  when  the  tax  returns  are  filed  and  the  global  taximplications are known, which can materiall
y impact our effective tax rate.The
 amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Ourestimate of the
 potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax relatedcontingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” 
above.For
 those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes , which
 contains  a  two-step  approach  to  recognizing  and  measuring  uncertain  tax  positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  The  first  step  is  todetermine if the weight of avai
lable evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of anyrelated
 appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized uponultimate
 settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the finaloutcome
 of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicialrulings, and refinement
 of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these mattersis
 different than  the  amounts recorded,  such  differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the  period in which  such  a determination ismade.
 Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include therelated interest and penalties.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We
 are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure.
 A  description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  is  provided  under  “BusinessCombinations”
 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potentialloss
 from  any  claim  or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  both  thedetermination
 of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to thesematters,
 accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassessthe
 potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities couldhave a material impact on our results
 of operations and financial position.42

Results of Operations
Presentation of Operating Segment R
esults and Other Financial InformationIn
 our fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidatedoperating
 expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below forsubstantially all of the other e
xpense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.In
 addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—whichare
 our  operating  segments  as  defined  pursuant  to  ASC  280, Segment  Reporting.  The  financial  reporting  for  our  three  businesses  that  is  presented  below  ispresented
 in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales andmarketing
 expenses that correspond  to and  are directly attributable to each of our three businesses.  We also utilize these  inputs to calculate and present  asegment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.
Consistent
 with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation is noted to include any revenues adjustments relatedto
 cloud  services  and  license  support  contracts  that  would  have  otherwise  been  recorded  by  the  acquired  businesses  as  independent  entities  but  were  notrecognized
 in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  periods  presented  due  to  business  combination  accounting  requirements.  refer  to“Supplemental
 Disclosure related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsincluded elsewhere in this Annual
 report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below tototal revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operati

 addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets,certain
 other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses or income, net andprovision for income
 taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businessesincluding
 such items and/or it is impractical to do so. refer to “Supplemental Disclosure related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain ofthese
 items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for a reconciliation of the summations of totalsegment
 margin  as  presented  in  the  discussion  below  to  total  income  before  provision  for  income  taxes  as  presented  per  our  consolidated  statements  ofoperations for all periods presented.
We
 experienced COVID-19 related impacts to our business during fiscal 2021 and 2020. Certain of these historical impacts on our operating results are furtherdiscussed below. Any future impacts are currently unknown.
Separately,
 as  described  further  below  and  in  Notes  1  and  14  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report,  werecorded
 a $2.3 billion non-recurring net deferred tax benefit during fiscal 2021 that related to a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted inthe intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights.
Constant Currency Presentation
Our
 international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As aresult,
 each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar againstmajor international currencies. In
 order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currencyrate
 fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual report using constant currency disclosure. Topresent
 this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollarsat constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2020, which was the last da
y of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effectduring the respective periods. For example, if an entity

1.19 million in fiscal 202 1 (using 1 .19 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.10  million in fiscal 2020  (using 1.10  as the month-endaverage
 exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 202 1 results using the fiscal 2020  exchange rateand
 indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the  period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unroundedresults in reported currency and in constant currency.

Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Excluding
 the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2021. The constant currency increase in our cloud and licensebusiness’
 revenues  during  fiscal  2021  was  offset  by  decreases  in  our  hardware  business’  revenues  and  services  business’  revenues.  The  constant  currencyincrease in our
 cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license supportrevenues
 and growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudand
 license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of ourtechnologies
 and to receive support services. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 wasdue
 to  the  emphasis  we  placed  on  the  marketing  and  sale  of  our  growing  cloud-based  infrastructure  technologies  and  the  de-emphasis  of  our  sales  andmarketing
 efforts for certain of our  non-strategic hardware products  and related support services. The constant currency  decrease in our services business’revenues
 during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a decline in our consulting revenues. All three of our businesses’ revenues wereadversely
 impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and some of these effects may continue into fiscal 2022. While weexpect
 these  effects  to  be  temporary,  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  for  future  periods  are  unknown.  In  constant  currency,  the  Americas,  EMEA  and  Asia  Pacificregions contributed 54%, 39% and 7%, respectively, to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2021.

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuation
s, our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lowersales
 and  marketing  expenses,  lower  hardware  expenses  and lower  services  expenses,  all  of  which  were  primarily  attributable  to  lower  headcount  and  areduction
 in certain variable expenditures as further described below. In addition, we also incurred lower amortization of intangible assets during fiscal 2021.These
 constant  currency  expense  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  certain  constant  currency  expense  increases  during  fiscal  2021,  primarily:  higher  cloudservices
 and license support expenses, which increased primarily due to higher infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloudand
 license business’  revenues;  higher research and  development and  general and administrative expenses, each  of which increased  primarily due  to higheremployee
 related expenses; higher acquisition related and other expenses, which increased primarily due to certain right-of-use assets and other assets thatwere abandoned in conne
ction with plans to improve our cost structure and operations; and higher restructuring expenses, which increased due to actions takenduring fiscal 2021 pursuant to the Fisca
l 2019 Oracle restructuring Plan (2019 restructuring Plan). During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we curtailed a number of variableexpenditures across all of our
 lines of businesses and functions including employee travel expenses and marketing expenses, among others, primarily in responseto COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses may normal
ize in future periods provided global economic and health conditions improve.In
 constant  currency,  our  total  operating  margin  and  total  operating  margin  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues  increased  in  fiscal  2021  due  to  higher  totalrevenues and lower total operating expenses. In fiscal 2022, we expect to accelerate
 our investments primarily in our cloud and license business. We expect fiscal2022
 total expenses growth to exceed total revenues growth and, as a result, our fiscal 2022 total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues to bemodestly lower relative t
o fiscal 2021.Supplemental Disclosure Related to

In  connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, wedid
 not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entitiesupon
 delivery  of  the  contractual  obligations.  To  the  extent  customers  for  which  these  contractual  obligations  pertain  renew  these  contracts  with  us,  we  expect  to  recognize  revenues  for  the  fullcontracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.

 amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items, and after excluding a $2.3 billion tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred tax assetassociated
 with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure and any related deferred tax expense (refer to Notes 1 and 14 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in thisAnnual report
 for additional information), resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.9%, instead of (5.7%), which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations.For
 fiscal 2020, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after adjusting for the effects of items within the table above, such as for stock-basedcompensation,
 amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items, resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.4%, instead of 16.0%, which represented our effectivetax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations.
Cloud and License Business
Our
 cloud  and  license  business  engages  in  the  sale  and  marketing  of  our  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  that  are  delivered  through  variousdeployment
 models  and  include:  Oracle  license  support  offerings;  Oracle  cloud  services  offerings;  and  Oracle  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  offerings.License
 support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchasedby
 our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud servicesdeliver
 applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updatesand enhancements for,
 deploy, host, manage and support. revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generallyone
 to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent feesearned
 from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products withincloud
 and  on-premise  IT  environments  and  are  generally  recognized  up  front  at  the  point  in  time  when  the  software  is  made  available  to  the  customer  todownload and use. We continue
46

to
 place  significant  emphasis,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  on  direct  sales  through  our  own  sales  force.  We  also  continue  to  market  certain  of  ourofferings
 through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and salesand
 marketing  expenses.  These  costs  are  largely  personnel  and  infrastructure  related  including  the  cost  of  providing  our  cloud  services  and  license  supportofferings, salaries and commissions earned by our sa
les force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.

 the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 due togrowth
 in  our  cloud  services  and  license  support  revenues  and  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  revenues  as  customers  purchased  our  applications  andinfrastructur
e technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gainaccess
 to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support for which we delivered such cloud and support services during fiscal 2021. The growth inour
 cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impacts of COVID-19 forfuture
 periods  are  unknown.  In  constant  currency,  the  Americas,  EMEA  and  Asia  Pacific  regions  contributed  57%,  38%  and  5%,  respectively,  of  the  constantcurrency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2021.
In constant currency,
 our total cloud and license business’ expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower sales and marketing expenses,which
 decreased primarily due to lower employee related expenses and our curtailment of variable expenditures, including lower employee travel expenses andlower

 expenses, primarily in response to COVID-19. These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by higher cloud services and licensesupport
 expenses during fiscal 2021, which were primarily attributable to higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud andlicense business’ revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods and, in fiscal 2022, we expect this growth to accelerate
as we increase our existing 
data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.Excluding the effects of
 foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased infiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the fiscal 2021 increases in total revenues and the decreases in tota
l expenses for this business.Hardware Business
Our
 hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. Thehardware
 product  and  related  software,  such  as  an  operating  system  or  firmware,  are  highly  interdependent  and  interrelated  and  are  accounted  for  as  acombined
 performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  that  the  hardwareproduct
 is  delivered  to  the  customer  and  ownership  is  transferred  to  the  customer.  Our  hardware  business  also  earns  revenues  from  the  sale  of  hardwaresupport
 contracts  purchased  by  our  customers  at  their  option  and  that  are  generally  recognized  as  revenues  ratably  as  the  hardware  support  services  aredelivered
 over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independentdistributor
s and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with ourhardware
 business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internalmanufacturing operations or
 by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact ofinventory
 determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide supportservices; and
 sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of ourhardware offerings.

 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decline in ourconsulting revenues. Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 by the impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts
of

In
 constant currency, total services expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower employee related costs caused by lowerheadcount in addition to lower travel and sub-contractor expenses as
 described above. In

We
 recognized a benefit from income taxes in fiscal 2021 in comparison to income tax expense in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impact of a $2.3billion
 net tax benefit arising from an increase in a net deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in theintra-group transfer of certain intellectua

 authorities  and  an  increase  in  excess  tax  benefits  related  to  stock-based  compensation  expense,  partially  offset  by  an  unfavorable  jurisdictional  mix  ofearnings and higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021.

 $31,403   -10%  $34,940  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
 $46,554   8%  $43,057  
Working
 capital:  The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash used for repurchases of ourcommon stock, the reclassific
ation of $8.3 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used forcapital
 expenditures during fiscal 2021. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021(refer to recent
 Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal2021
 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, theamounts and timing of which are variable.
Cash,
 cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities:  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  primarily  consist  of  deposits  held  at  major  banks,  money  market  funds,  Tier-1commercial
 paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain othersecurities.
 The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash inflowsgenerated by our
 issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock optionexercises
 during fiscal 2021. These cash inflows during fiscal 2021 were partially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $20.9 billion for settled repurchases ofour
 common  stock,  payments  of  cash  dividends  to  our  stockholders,  the  repayment  of  $2.6  billion  related  to  our  borrowings,  and  cash  used  for  capitalexpenditures.
The
 amount  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  that  we  report  in  U.S.  Dollars  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  cash,  cash  equivalents  andmarketable
 securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as ofthe
 end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidatedbalance
 sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual report). As theU.S.
 Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2021, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthat
 we  reported  in  U.S.  Dollars  for  these  subsidiaries  increased  on  a  net  basis  as  of  May  31,  2021  relative  to  what  we  would  have  reported  using  constantcurrency rates from the May 31, 2020 balance sheet date.

 flows from operating activities:    Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal oftheir
 license support agreements. Payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course 
of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the53

 of  new  licenses,  cloud  services,  hardware  offerings  and  other  services.  Our  primary  uses  of  cash  from operating  activities  are  for  employee  relatedexpenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments 
and leased facilities. Net
 cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher net income, higher cash collections fromcustomers, a portion of whic
h were previously delayed due to the global economic effects that resulted from COVID-19, and certain other cash favorable workingcapital changes, in each case in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal
 2020.Cash
 flows from investing activities:  The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales ofour investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, 
including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.Net
 cash used for investing activities was $13.1 billion during fiscal 2021 in comparison to net cash provided by investing activities of $9.8 billion during fiscal2020.
 Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in cash used for the purchases of marketable securities andother investments and
 an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities andother
 investments, in each case during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020.  In fiscal 2022, we expect our capital expenditures could nearly double relative to fiscal2021, primarily to increase data center capacities and geographic locations to
 meet current and expected customer demand for our cloud services.Cash
 flows  from  financing  activities:  The  changes  in  cash  flows  from  financing  activities  primarily  relate  to  borrowings  and  repayments  related  to  our  debtinstruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.
Net
 cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of senior notes andhigher
 stock repurchases, partially offset by lower debt repayments and higher cash proceeds from stock option exercises, in each case during fiscal 2021 incomparison to fiscal 2020.

:    To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basisto
 analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with ourcompetitors.
 The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of ourperformance, or as an alternative to cash fl
ows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: 
 
 Year Ended May 31,  (Dollars in millions)
 2021   Change  2020  Net cash provided by operating activities
 $15,887   21%  $13,139  Capital expenditures
  (2,135 )  37%   (1,564 ) Free cash flow
 $13,752   19%  $11,575  Net income
 $13,746     $10,135  Free cash flow as percent of net income
 100%     114%  
Long-Term Customer Fin
ancing:  We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and other services offerings throughseparate
 long-term  payment  contracts.  We  generally  sell  these  contracts  that  we  have  financed  for  our  customers  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to  financialinstitutions
 within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions assales of
 financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $941 million in fiscal 2021 and$1.0 billion in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues.

Recent Financing Activities
: Cash Dividends
:    In fiscal 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.04 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2021, our Board of Directors declared aquarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 29, 2021 to stockholders of record as
 of the close of business on July15,
 2021. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board ofDirectors.
Senior Notes
:  In March 2021, we issued $15.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following: 
•$2.75 billion of 1.65% senior notes due March 2026;  
•$2.00 billion of 2.30% senior notes due March 2028;  
•$3.25 billion of 2.875% senior notes due March 2031;  
•$2.25 billion of 3.65% senior notes due March 2041;  
•$3.25 billion of 3.95% senior notes due March 2051; and  
•$1.50 billion of 4.10% senior notes due March 2061. We
 issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repaymentof
 indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, we repaid $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additionaldetails regarding our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes t
o Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.Common Stock Repurch
ase Program:    Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 10, 2021, weannounced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our st
ock repurchase program by an additional $20.0 billion. As of May 31, 2021, approximately$15.6
 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion, 361.0million shares for
 $19.2 billion, and 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does nothave
 an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitionsand dividend payments,
 our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchasesmay
 be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated,suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
  Contractual Obligations
:    Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2021 consisted of: 
•principal  payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodicinterest payments;
 
•routine tax payments including t hose that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included inour consolidated balance sheet;
 
•operating lease liabilities that  are included in our consolidated balance sheet; and 
•other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable  and legally binding.In
 addition,  as  of  May  31,  2021,  we  had  $8.5  billion  of  gross  unrecognized  income  tax  benefits,  including  related  interest  and  penalties,  recorded  on  ourconsolidated
 balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it isreasonably
 possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2022. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which areinherently
 uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and manyaspects are out of our control. Notes 7, 11, 14 and 17 of

Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report include additional information regarding our contractual obligations andcontingencies
. We
 believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,capital
 expenditures  and  contractual  obligation  requirements.  In  addition,  we  believe  that  we  could  fund  our  future  acquisitions,  dividend  payments  andrepurchases
 of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additionalborrowings or from the issuance of additional
 securities.Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options
Our
 stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employeesand align their interests with the interests of exist
ing stockholders.We
 recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awardsgranted
 while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2018 has been aweighted-a
verage annualized rate of 1.0% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awardsand
 stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by theweighted-average
 outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest andstock
 options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2021, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lowerthan
 the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based
 compensation  program.  However,  we  may  modify  the  levels  of  our  stock  repurchases  in  the  future  depending  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  theamount
 of  cash  we  have  available  for  acquisitions,  to  pay  dividends,  to  repay  or  repurchase  indebtedness  or  for  other  purposes.  As  of  May  31,  2021,  themaximum
 potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless ofwhether vested or unvested, was 7.7%.
During
 fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants toselected
 employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of aseparate executive officer
 committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2021 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal yearto grant equity within his or her organizat
ion, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.56

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For information with respect to
 recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, ifany, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated F
inancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securiti
esCash,
 cash equivalents and marketable securities were $46.6 billion and $43.1 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our bank deposits are generallyheld
 with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratingscriteria,
 which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2021, substantially all of our marketable securities were highquality, fixed-r
ate debt securities and had maturity dates within one year (a description of the types of marketable securities held as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 isincluded
 in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report and “Liquidity and Capital resources” above).The
 market values of our fixed-rate marketable securities investments are adversely impacted as interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, we mayrealize losses
 if we sell securities prior to their scheduled maturities that declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classifysubstantially
 all of our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record changes in their fair values to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets, nogains
 or losses are recognized in our earnings due to market changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to their scheduled maturities or thedeclines in fair values are due to expected credit loss. We
 generally do not use our marketable debt securities investments for trading purposes.Borrowings and Related Fair Value Hed
gesOur
 total borrowings were $84.2 billion as of May 31, 2021, consisting of $84.1 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings, comparedto
 $71.6 billion as of May 31, 2020, consisting of $71.5 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings. With the exception of those seniornotes for which we have
57

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
corresponding
 fair value hedges that are recorded at their fair values as of each reporting period and discussed further below, we record all of our fixed-rateborrowings
 at amortized cost and therefore, any changes in interest rates do not impact the values that we report for these senior notes or our consolidatedfinancial statements.
As of May 31,
 2021, we held certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interestrate
 obligations associated with certain of our senior notes to variable interest rate obligations based on LIBOr that we have designated as fair value hedges,among
 certain other effects. Consequently, these swap agreements are recorded at their fair values at each reporting period and incur gains and losses due tochanges
 in market interest rates but are substantially offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related senior notes for which the swap agreementspertained. By
 entering into these swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOr. Changes in interest ratesaffected
 the interest expense that we recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and the values that we report for these instruments as of eachreporting
 date. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included elsewhere in this Annual report. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes.
Currency Risk
Foreign Currency Translation Risk
As
 described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significantportion
 of our consolidated  revenues and expenses  that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated  revenues  and expenses  are affected and willcontinue
 to  be  affected  by  changes  in  the  U.S.  Dollar  against  major  foreign  currencies.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  currencies  impact  the  amount  of  total  assets,liabilities,
 earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of,each
 reporting  period.  In  particular,  the  strengthening  of  the  U.S.  Dollar  generally  will  reduce  the  reported  amount  of  our  foreign-denominated  cash,  cashequivalents,
 marketable securities, total revenues and total expense that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for,and as of the end of, each reporting period.
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk
We
 transact  business  in  various  foreign  currencies.  Our  principal  currency  exposures  include  the  Euro,  Japanese  Yen,  Saudi  Arabian  riyal,  Indian  rupee  andBritish
 Pound.  Our foreign  currency  exposures primarily arise from various  intercompany transactions. We have established a  program that primarily utilizesforeign
 currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreigncurrency
 forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset bygains
 or  losses  on  the  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  which  mitigate  the  risks  and  volatility  associated  with  our  foreign  currency  transactions.  We  maysuspend
 this  program  from  time  to  time.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  generally  short-term  in  duration  and  we  do  not  use  them  for  tradingpurposes.
We
 realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, and we also incurcosts
 to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, substantially all of which are included in non-operating income, net in our consolidated financialstatements.
 Our  ultimate  realized  gain  or  loss  with  respect  to  foreign  currency  exposures  will  generally  depend  on  the  size  and  type  of  cross-currencytransactions
 that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on ourforeign
 currency  forward  contracts  and  other  factors.  Furthermore,  as  a  large  portion  of  our  consolidated  operations  are  international,  we  could  experienceadditional
 foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. refer to Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included elsewhere in this Annual report for additional details 
about our foreign currency forward contracts.58

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
 of the end of the period covered by this Annual report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of ourDisclosure
 Committee  and  our  management,  including  our  Principal  Executive  and  Financial  Officer,  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of  ourdisclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).
Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participati
on of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report,our
 Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2021 to provide reasonableassurance
 that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized andreported
 within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  PrincipalExecutive and Financial Officer as appropriate t
o allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
 ReportingOur management is responsible for establish
ing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act rules13a-15(f)
 and  15d-15(f).  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  our  Principal  Executive  and  Financial  Officer,  weconducted
 an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 framework. Our internal control overfinancial
 reporting  includes  policies  and  procedures  that  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  offinancial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. 
GAAP.Based
 on  the  results  of  our  evaluation,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  May  31,  2021.  Wereviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
The
 effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 202 1 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered publicaccounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial R
eportingThere
 were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Actrules
 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controlover financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our
 management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financialreporting
 are  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving  their  objectives  and  are  effective  at  the  reasonable  assurance  level.  However,  ourmanagement
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Acontrol
 system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system aremet.
 Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative totheir
 costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all  control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  controls  can  provide  absolute  assurance  that  all  control  issues  andinstances
 of  fraud,  if  any,  have  been  detected.  These  inherent  limitations  include  the  realities  that  judgments  in  decision-making  can  be  faulty  and  thatbreakdowns
 can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion oftwo
 or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about thelikelihood
 of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; overtime,
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because ofthe inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
 system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Oracle CorporationOpinion on the Financial Statements
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation (the Company) as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidatedstatements of operations, comprehensive income,
 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2021, the related notes and thefinancial
 statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statementspresent
 fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows foreach of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles.We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol
 over  financial  reporting  as  of  May  31,  2021,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway C
ommission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
These
 financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company’s  financialstatements based
 on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company inaccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
 and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing proceduresto
 assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.Such
 procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  includedevaluating
 the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financialstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reas
onable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matter
The
 critical  audit  matters  communicated  below  are  matters  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  financial  statements  that  were  communicated  orrequired to be
 communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involvedour
 especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financialstatements, taken
 as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or onthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
 
 
 Legal Contingencies Description of the
matter
 As  discussed in Note 17 of the financial statements, the Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings. The Companyaccrues
 a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amountcan
 be  reasonably  estimated.  For  purposes  of  disclosure,  the  Company  also  performs  an  assessment  of  the  materiality  of  legalcontingencies
 where  a  loss  is  either  reasonably  possible  or  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  an  exposure  to  loss  exists  in  excess  of  theamount accrued.
The
 audit  of  the  Company’s  accounting  for  and  disclosure  of  legal  contingencies  was  highly  subjective  and  required  significantjudgment
 in  assessing  the  Company’s  evaluation  of  the  probability  of  a  loss,  and  the  estimated  amount  or  range  of  loss.   Thesejudgments were impacted by uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of the legal
 contingencies, the status of the litigation or theappeals processes, and the status of any settlement discussions associated w
ith the legal contingencies.63

How 
w e addressedthe 
matter in o ura
udit We obtained  an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the identification andevaluation
 of these matters, including controls over management’s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss and whetherthe loss or range of loss w
as reasonably estimable.Our substantive audit
 procedures, among others, included gaining an understanding of the status of ongoing lawsuits, reviewing lettersaddressing
 the matters from internal and external legal counsel, meetings with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, andobtaining
 a  representation  letter  from  management  on  these  matters.  We  also  evaluated  the  Company’s  disclosures  in  relation  tothese matters.
 
  Income Tax – Uncerta in tax positionsDescription of the
matter
 As  discussed in Note 14 of the financial statements, the Company recognizes uncertain tax positions and measures unrecognized taxbenefits
 related to various domestic and foreign matters. As of May 31, 2021, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $6.9billion,
 of which $4.4 billion, if recognized would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company uses significant judgment inthe
 accounting  for  uncertain  tax  positions  including  the  interpretation  and  application  of  tax  laws  and  legal  rulings  in  variousjurisdictions.
Auditing
 management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurementof
 the benefit of various tax positions was complex, involved significant judgment, and was based on interpretations of tax laws andlegal rulings.
How we addressed
the matter in our
audit
 We  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design,  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  the  controls  over  management’sprocess
 for  interpretation  of  tax  laws  and  legal  rulings,  as  well  as  development  of  the  assumptions  and  estimates  used  in  themeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
To
 test  management’s  assessment  of  which  uncertain  tax  positions  are  more  likely  than  not  to  be  sustained,  we  performed  auditprocedures
 that  included,  among  others  reading  and  evaluating  management’s  assumptions  and  analysis,  including  anycommunications
 with taxing authorities that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our taxsubject
 matter professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws andexperience with related taxing authorities.
In addition, we also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in re
lation to these matters included in Note 14 of the financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Oracle CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We
 have audited Oracle Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control— IntegratedFramework
 issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)  (the  COSO  criteria).  In  our  opinion,  OracleCorporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects,
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of Oracle Corporation as of
 May 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows foreach
 of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2021, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 and ourreport dated June 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  ofinternal control over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management’s report on Internal Control Over Financial reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
 financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare
 required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
 conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonableassurance about whether effective internal control over financial report
ing was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  andevaluating
 the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considerednecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
 basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial rep
orting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe
 transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permitpreparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are beingmade only in accordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timelydetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of Financial Statements
The
 consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positionsof
 certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle’s stockholders for allperiods
 presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore havenot
 been  presented  separately  and  instead  are  included  as  a  component  of  non-operating  income,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.Intercompany
 transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net 
income.The
 comparability of our operating results during fiscal 2021 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as ofMay
 31, 2021 and 2020, was impacted by the income tax related effects of a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-grouptransfer of
 certain intellectual property rights. During fiscal 2021, we recognized a benefit from income taxes primarily due to the result of a total net tax benefitof
 $2.3  billion  that  was  recorded  as  a  deferred  tax  asset  of  $11.3  billion  and  a  non-current  deferred  tax  liability  of  $9.1  billion.  The  deferred  tax  asset  wasrecognized
 as  a  result  of  the  book  and  tax  basis  difference  on  the  intra-group  transfer  of  certain  intellectual  property  and  the  realignment  of  certain  legalentities,
 partially  offset  by  a  Global  Intangible  Low-Taxed  Income  (GILTI)  non-current  deferred  tax  liability.  The  tax  amortization  related  to  the  intellectualproperty
 deferred tax asset will be recognized in future periods and any unused amortization in a particular year will carry forward indefinitely. The $11.3 billiondeferred
 tax asset was measured based on the tax rate at which it is expected to reverse in the future. We expect to realize the net deferred tax asset recordedas
 a result of the intangible property transfer and will periodically assess the realizability of the net deferred tax asset. refer to Note 14 below for additionalinformation regarding our income taxes.

Use of Estimates
Our
 consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  FinancialAccounting
 Standards  Board’s  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the  various  staff  accounting  bulletins  and  other  applicableguidance
 issued  by  the  SEC.  These  accounting  principles  require  us  to  make  certain  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the  estimates,judgments
 and  assumptions  upon  which  we  rely  are  reasonable  based  upon  information  available  to  us  at  the  time  that  these  estimates,  judgments  andassumptions
 are made. These estimates, judgments  and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financialstatements
 as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between theseestimates,
 judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of aparticular
 transaction  is  specifically  dictated  by  GAAP  and  does  not  require  management’s  judgment  in  its  application.  There  are  also  areas  in  whichmanagement’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a mater
ially different result.Revenue Recognition
Our sources of revenues include:
 
•cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, which typical lyrepresent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;
 
•hardware revenue s, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and
 
•services  revenues,  which  are  earned  from  providing  cloud-,  license-  and  hardware-related  services  including  consulting  and  advanced  customerservices.
License support revenues are
 typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by ourcustomers at their
 option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patchesreleased
 during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical supportpersonnel. License
 support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customerselect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.
Cloud
 services  revenues  include  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  deliver  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  via  cloud-baseddeployment
 models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and thatcustomers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.
Cloud
 license  and  on-premise  license  revenues  primarily  represent  amounts  earned  from  granting  customers  perpetual  licenses  to  use  our  database,middleware,
 application  and  industry-specific  software  products,  which  our  customers  use  for  cloud-based,  on-premise  and  other  IT  environments.  The  vastmajority of our cloud license and on-premise l
icense arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.revenues
 from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage,and industry-specific hardware. Our hardware support offerings

generally provide
 customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased andcan
 also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of thenet hardware products fees.
Our services are offered
 to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consultingservices
 are designed  to help  our customers  to, among others,  deploy,  architect,  integrate,  upgrade  and  secure  their investments  in  Oracle applications andinfrastructure
 technologies.  Our  advanced  customer  services  are  designed  to  provide  supplemental  support  services,  performance  and  higher  availability  forOracle products and services.
We
 apply the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue  From Contracts with Customers (ASC  606) as a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of ourcloud,
 license, hardware and services arrangements and generally require revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or servicesprovided
 to  our  customers,  reflecting  the  amount  of  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  those  goods  or  services.  Pursuant  to  ASC  606,  revenues  arerecognized upon the application of the following steps
:  
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;  
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;  
•determination of the transaction price;  
•allocation of the transaction price to  the performance obligations in the contract; and 
•recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are s atisfied.Our
 customers  that  contract  with  us  for  the  provision  of  cloud  services,  software,  hardware  or  other  services  include  businesses  of  many  sizes,  governmentagencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.
The
 timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accountsreceivable
 on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheetswhen
 revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoicesfor
 cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery tothe
 customer of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS andIaaS contracts are generally invoiced an
nually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Mostcontracts
 that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financedthrough
 our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating income,net within our consolidated statements of operations based 
on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.  Our
 revenue  arrangements  generally  include  standard  warranty  or  service  level  provisions  that  our  arrangements  will  perform  and  operate  in  all  materialrespects
 as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Ourarrangements
 generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collectedfrom customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services
revenues from
 cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud services are delivered,beginning
 on the date our service is made available to a customer. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits ofthe
 cloud  services  throughout  the  contract  period.  revenues  from  cloud  services  that  are  provided  on  a  consumption  basis,  such  as  metered  services,  aregenerally recognized based on the utilization of
 the services by the customer.Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support
Oracle’s
 primary  performance  obligations with  respect  to  license  support  contracts  and  hardware  support  contracts  are  to  provide  customers  with  technicalsupport
 as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period, if and when they areavailable,
 and hardware product repairs, as applicable. Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughoutthe
 contract  period.  Therefore,  revenues  for  license  support  contracts  and  hardware  support  contracts  are  generally  recognized  ratably  over  the  contractualperiods that the support services are provided
.   Revenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and On-Pre
mise Licensesrevenues
 from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software ismade
 available to the customer to download and use. revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses arerecognized
 at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, theminimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is
 made available to the royalty customer.Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products
The
 hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as acombined
 performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  that  the  hardwareproduct is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer.
Revenue Recognition for Services
Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the serv
ices are performed. revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applyinginput methods to estimate progress to completion. revenues for consumption-based services are generall
y recognized as the services are performed.Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple 
Performance ObligationsMany
 of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracleproducts
 and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally notcombined.
 We  allocate  the  transaction  price  for  each  contract  to  each  performance  obligation  based  on  the  relative  standalone  selling  price  (SSP)  for  eachperformance obligation within each contract.
We
 use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses,we
 are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. Wetypicall
y establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licensesand on-premise licenses have not historically been so
ld on a standalone basis, as the74

vast
 majority  of  all  customers  elect  to  purchase  license  support  contracts  at  the  time  of  a  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  purchase.  License  supportcontracts
 are  generally  priced  as  a  percentage  of  the  net  fees  paid  by  the  customer  to  access  the  license.  We  are  unable  to  establish  the  SSP  for  our  cloudlicenses
 and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highlyvariable)
 and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise
 license  included  in  a  contract  with  multiple  performance  obligations  is  generally  determined  by  applying  a  residual  approach  whereby  all  otherperformance
 obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount oftransaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise 
license revenues. Remaining Performance Oblig
ations from Customer ContractsTrade
 receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidatedbalance sheets as of May 31, 2021 and 2020. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that were included
in
 the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was approximately $8.0 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. revenuesrecognized from performanc
e obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year endedMay 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.  
remaining
 performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have beenissued
 to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in futureperiods.
 The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. Ineach
 fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our firstfiscal
 quarter.  These  seasonal  impacts  influence  how  our  remaining  performance  obligations  change  over  time  and,  combined  with  foreign  exchange  ratefluctuations
 and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2021, our remainingperformance
 obligations  were  $41.3  billion,  approximately  60%  of  which  we  expect  to  recognize  as  revenues  over  the  next  twelve  months,  29%  over  thesubsequent month 13 to month 36 and the remainder thereafter.
Sales of Financing Receivables
We
 offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term paymentcontracts.
 We  generally  sell  these  contracts  that  we  have  financed  for  our  customers  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to  financial  institutions  within  90  days  of  thecontracts’
 dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we areconsidered
 to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively,of our financing receivables were sold to financia
l institutions.Business Combinations
We
 apply  the  provisions  of  ASC  805, Business  Combinations (ASC  805),  in  accounting  for  our  acquisitions.  ASC  805  requires  that  we  evaluate  whether  atransacti
on pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capableof
 being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisitionto
 the  individual  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  on  a  relative  fair  value  basis;  whereas  the  acquisition  of  a  business  requires  us  to  recognize  separately  fromgoodwill the assets acquired and the liabilit

assumed
 at the acquisition date fair  values. Goodwill  as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net ofthe
 acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assetsacquired
 and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  business  acquisition  date  as  well  as  any  contingent  consideration,  where  applicable,  our  estimates  are  inherentlyuncertain
 and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we recordadjustments
 to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  with  the  corresponding  offset  to  goodwill.  Upon  the  conclusion  of  a  business  acquisition’smeasurement
 period  or  final  determination  of  the  values  of  assets  acquired  or  liabilities  assumed,  whichever  comes  first,  any  subsequent  adjustments  arerecorded
 to  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations. Costs  to  exit  or  restructure  certain  activities  of  an  acquired  company  or  our  internal  operations  areaccounted for
 as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obli gations ( ASC 420), and are accounted for separately from the businesscombination.
 A  liability  for  costs  associated  with  an  exit  or  disposal  activity  is  recognized  and  measured  at  its  fair  value  in  our  consolidated  statement  ofoperation
s in the period in which the liability is incurred. Prior to June 1, 2019, we accounted for operating lease abandonment pursuant to the provisions of ASC420. Effective June 1, 2019, abandoned operating leases related to an acquired company or our internal operations are 
accounted for as right-of-Use (rOU )  assetimpairment
 charges pursuant to ASC  842, Leases  (ASC  842) and  are accounted for separately from the business combination. In all periods presented, whenestimating the asset impairment c
harges, assumptions were applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ from actual results.This may require us to revise our initi
al estimates which may affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For
 a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation ofthese
 pre-acquisition  contingencies  throughout  the  measurement  period  in  order  to  obtain  sufficient  information  to  assess  whether  we  include  thesecontingencies
 as  a  part  of  the  fair  value  estimates  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed  and,  if  so,  to  determine  their  estimated  amounts.  If  we  cannotreasonably
 determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the casegiven
 the nature of such  matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency  if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or aliability
 had  been  incurred  at  the  business  acquisition  date  and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Subsequent  to  themeasurement
 period  or  final  determination  of  the  net  asset  values  for  the  business  combination,  whichever  comes  first,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  suchcontingencies will affect earnings and could have a material
 effect on our results of operations and financial position.In
 addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. Wereevaluate
 these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminaryestimates
 being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the taxallowance’s or contingency’s estimated value,
 whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect ourprovision for income taxes in our conso
lidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
In
 accordance  with  ASC  320, Investments—Debt  Securities,  and  based  on  our  intentions  regarding  these  instruments,  we  classify  substantially  all  of  ourmarketable
 debt securities as available-for-sale. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a componentof
 stockholders’ equity, except for any unrealized losses determined to be related to credit losses, which we record within non-operating income, net in theaccompanying
 consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantiallyall of our marketable debt securities
76

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 2021  
investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their ava
ilability for use in current operations. Investments in equity se
curities, other than any equity method investments, are generally recorded at their fair values, if the fair values are readily determinable.Non-marketable
 equity securities where we do not have control of, nor significant influence in, the investee are recorded at cost, less any impairment, adjustedfor
 observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer with any gains or losses recorded as a componentof
 non-operating  income,  net  as  of  and  for  each  reporting  period.  For  investments  through  which  we  have  significant  influence  in,  but  not  control  of,  theinvestee,
 we account for such investments pursuant to the equity method of accounting whereby we record our proportionate share of the investee’s earningsor losses,
 amortization of differences between our investment basis and the proportional book equity of the investee, and impairment, if any, as a component ofnon-operating
 income, net for each reporting period. Our non-marketable equity securities and related instruments totaled $971 million and $219 million as ofMay
 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included either in other current assets or in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balancesheets
 and are subject to periodic impairment reviews and adjustments for observable price changes from orderly transactions. Certain of the non-marketableequity
 securities  held  as  of  May  31,  2021  and  2020  were  with  a  related  party  entity  for  which  we  follow  the  equity  method  of  accounting.  We  are  also  acounterparty
 to certain options to acquire additional equity interests in that entity at various times through December 2023 and we could obtain control of thatentity should such options be exercised.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We
 apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair  Value Measurement (ASC  820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant toother accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments.
The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are
 included in Note 4.Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
We
 record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed,provisions
 are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivablewas
 recorded in and current and expected future economic conditions. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we haveexhausted our collection efforts without success
. Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instrum
ents that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivativesand
 trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure toany
 single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities.Our
 derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses inthese
 contracts  is largely mitigated  with collateral security  agreements  that provide  for collateral to be received  or posted  when the net fair values of thesecontracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do not
 require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to tradereceivable
s is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customercontracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer 
accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.77

We
 outsource the manufacturing,  assembly and delivery of the substantial majority of our hardware products  to a variety of companies, many of which arelocated outside the U.S. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of
locations where these third-party man
ufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contractedservices for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of 
our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Inventories
Inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-outbasis.
 We  evaluate  our  ending  inventories  for  estimated  excess  quantities  and  obsolescence.  This  evaluation  includes  analysis  of  sales  levels  by  product  andprojections
 of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and chargedto
 hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete.At
 the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in therestoration
 or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balancesheets and totaled $142 million and $211 million at May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Other Receivables
Other receivables represent value-added
 tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables areincluded
 in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $798 million and $778 million at May 31, 2021 and 2020,respectively.
Deferred Sales Commissions
We
 defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support andhardware
 support contract. Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-linebasis
 over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four years. We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expecteddurations of
 our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to certainof
 our  cloud-based  arrangements  are  generally  deferred  and  then  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  related  contractual  renewal  period,  which  isgenerally
 one  to  three  years.  Amortization  of  deferred  sales  commissions  is  included  as  a  component  of  sales  and  marketing  expenses  in  our  consolidatedstatements
 of  operations  and  asset  balances  for  deferred  sales  commissions  are  included  in  other  current  assets  and  other  non-current  assets  in  ourconsolidated balance sheets.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
 method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of theestimated
 useful  lives  of  the  improvements  or  the  lease  terms,  as  appropriate.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  periodically  reviewed  for  impairmentwhenever
 events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  We  did  not  recognize  any  significantproperty impairment charges in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments
Goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase  price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangibleassets
 that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period weevaluate the estimated remaining usef
ul lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remainingperiods of amortization.
The carrying amounts of
 our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibleassets)
 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed forimpairment,
 we  have  the  option  to  perform  an  assessment  of  qualitative  factors  of  impairment  (optional  assessment)  prior  to  necessitating  a  quantitativeimpairment
 test.  Should  the  optional  assessment  be  used  for  any  given  fiscal  year,  qualitative  factors  to  consider  for  a  reporting  unit  include:  cost  factors;financial
 performance;  legal,  regulatory,  contractual,  political,  business,  or  other  factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerations;macroecono
mic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likelythan not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying valu
e, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. Forthose
 reporting units tested using a quantitative  approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting  unit with the carrying amount of the reporting  unit,including goodwill.
 To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows thereporting
 unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis; future economic and marketconditions;
 and market comparables of peer companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less thanthe
 carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit. Ourmost
 recent  goodwill  impairment  analysis  was  performed  on  March  1,  2021  and  did  not  result  in  a  goodwill  impairment  charge.  We  did  not  recognizeimpairment charges in fiscal 2020 or 2019.
recoverability
 of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset isexpected
 to generate. recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If theasset
 is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impairedasset.
 We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our finite livedintangible
 assets  and  may  adjust  the  period  over  which  these  assets  are  amortized  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  a  shorteramortization period is more
 reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows.Derivative Financial Instruments
During
 fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 10 below for additionalinformation). We do not use derivative f
inancial instruments for trading purposes. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging 
(ASC 815), which  requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as ofeach
 reporting  date.  ASC  815  also  requires  that  changes  in  our  derivatives’  fair  values  be  recognized  in  earnings,  unless  specific  hedge  accounting  anddocumentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges).
The
 accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  a  derivative  depends  on  the  intended  use  of  the  derivative  and  the  resulting  designation.  For  a  derivativeinstrument
 designated  as  a  fair  value  hedge,  loss  or  gain  attributable  to  the  risk  being  hedged  is  recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  of  change  with  acorresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged.

For
 a  derivative  instrument  designated  as  a  cash  flow  hedge,  each  reporting  period  we  record  the  change  in  fair  value  of  the  derivative  to  AOCL  in  ourconsolidated balance sheets, and the change is reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings.
Leases
Our
 accounting policy for leases pursuant to ASC 842, Leases, was prospectively effective for us as of June 1, 2019. We determine if an arrangement is a lease atits
 inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Wegenerally
 use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of futurepayments,
 because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not known. rOU assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inceptionbased
 on  the  initial  measurement  of  the  lease  liability,  plus  any  prepaid  lease  payments  and  less  any  lease  incentives.  Our  lease  terms  that  are  used  indetermining
 our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we willexercise
 such options. We amortize our rOU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the leaseamortization
 and imputed interest as operating expenses. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such cases, we generallyaccount
 for the components as a single lease component. We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term of lessthan one year.
rOU
 assets related to our operating leases are included in other non-current assets, short-term operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities,and
 long-term operating lease liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash flow movements related to ourlease
 activities  are  included  in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  assets  and  accounts  payable  and  other  liabilities  as  presented  in  net  cash  provided  by  operatingactiviti
es in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020. Note 11 below provides additional information regarding ourleases.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We
 are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure.
 Descriptions  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  are  provided  under  “BusinessCombinations”
 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for anestimated
 loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 17 belowprovides additional information regarding certain of 
our legal contingencies.Foreign Currency
We
 transact  business  in  various  foreign  currencies.  In  general,  the  functional  currency  of  a  foreign  operation  is  the  local  country’s  currency.  Consequently,revenues
 and  expenses  of  operations  outside  the  U.S.  are  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  using  weighted-average  exchange  rates  while  assets  and  liabilities  ofoperations
 outside  the  U.S.  are  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  using  exchange  rates  at  the  balance  sheet  dates.  The  effects  of  foreign  currency  translationadjustments
 are  substantially  included  in  stockholders’  equity  as  a  component  of  Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Loss  (AOCL)  in  the  accompanyingconsolidated
 balance  sheets  and  related  periodic  movements  are  summarized  as  a  line  item  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income.  Netforeign
 exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $112 million, $185million and $111 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation
We
 account  for  share-based  payments  to  employees,  including  grants  of  service-based  restricted  stock  unit  awards,  service-based  employee  stock  options,performance-based stock options (PSOs), and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718, 
Compensation — Stock Compensation,which requires
 that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fairvalues. We account for forfeitures of stock-based aw
ards as they occur.For
 our  service-based  stock  awards,  we  recognize  stock-based  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  service  period  of  the  award,  which  isgenerally four years.
For
 our PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived, explicit or implicit service period (which isthe
 period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied). During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensation expenseis
 recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in achange
 in  the  number  of  shares  that  are  expected  to  vest,  or  changes  in  our  estimates  of  implicit  service  periods,  may  cause  the  amount  of  stock-basedcompensation
 expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of sharesthat
 are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSO tranche on a cumulative catch upbasis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered. Changes in estimates
 of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively.We
 record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount ofstock-based compens
ation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection witha
 business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductionsfor
 stock-based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or astock
 option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision forincome taxes in such period. Note 13 below provides additional
 information regarding our stock-based compensation plans.Advertising
Substantially
 all advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $202 million,$178 million and $169 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Research and Development Costs and Software 
Development CostsAll
 research and development costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research  and Development.  Software development costs required tobe
 capitalized under ASC 985-20, Costs  of  Software  to  be  Sold,  Leased  or  Marketed, and  under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use  Software, were  not  material  to  ourconsolidated financial statements in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.

We
 account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income  Taxes (ASC  740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences oftemporary
 differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  amounts  recognized  for  income  tax  purposes.  Werecord a valuation allow
ance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.A two-step approach is appli
ed pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.The
 first  step  is  to  determine  if  the  weight  of  available  evidence  indicates  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  tax  position  will  be  sustained  in  an  audit,including
 resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%likely to be
 realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of ourconsolidated statements of operations.

 (ASU  2020-04) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional guidancefor
 contract modifications and certain hedging relationships associated with the transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. We willadopt Topic 848
 when our relevant contracts are modified upon transition to alternative reference rates. We do not expect our adoption of Topic 848 will have amaterial impact on our consolidated financia

:   In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes  (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU  2019-12), which isintended
 to simplify various areas related to the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application of Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 is effective for usbeginning
 in  fiscal  2022,  and  earlier  adoption  is  permitted.  We  do  not  expect  our  adoption  of  ASU  2019-12  will have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidatedfinancial statements.

ACQUISITIONS Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 Acquisitions
During
 fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we  acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our productsand services offerings
. These acquisitions were not significant  individually or in the aggregate to our conso lidated financial statements. 
3.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES Cash
 and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, money market funds and other securitieswith
 original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain othersecurities.
The
 amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2021 and 2020. We use thespecific
 identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realizedgains
 and  losses  were  insignificant  for  fiscal  2021,  2020  and  2019.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  components  of  our  cash  equivalents  and  marketablesecurities held, substantially all of which were
 classified as available-for-sale:

As
 of May 31, 2021 and 2020, substantially all of our marketable securities investments mature within one year. Our investment portfolio is subject to marketrisk due
 to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high creditratings and also limit the amount of 
credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve ourinvested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We
 perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer
 a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assetsand
 liabilities required  to be recorded  at their fair values, we consider  the  principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and  considerassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or l
iabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.ASC
 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs whenmeasuring
 fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fairvalue measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to me
asure fair value: 
•Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
•Level  2:  inputs  other  than  Level  1  that  are  observable,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  such  as  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  similar  assets  orliabilities,
 quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  assets  or  liabilities  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  becorroborated by observable market data for substantia
lly the full term of the assets or liabilities; or 
•Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a
 Recurring BasisOur assets and liabilities measured at
 fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):

In  July 2013, we issued €2.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of €1.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes that were due and were settled in January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and €750 million of3.125% senior notes
 due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes in the table abovewere calculated using foreign currency exchange rates, 
as applicable, as of May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively. The July 2025 Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange.(2)
In  connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements, all of which were cash settled upon their maturity during fiscal 2021 (see Note 10for additional information).
(3)
We entered into  certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effects of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with the 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes)so
 that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOr. The effective interest rates after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements were0.87%
 and 1.99%, respectively, for the July 2021 Notes as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges associated with ourJuly 2021 Notes.

 and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $871 million based on LIBOr. The effective interest rates as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 aftercons
ideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements were 3.15% and 4.46%, respectively, for the July 2025 Notes. refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair valuehedges.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges
— Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap AgreementsIn
 May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July2025
 Notes  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro  denominated  2025  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  of  principal  atmaturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Do
llar denominated debt based on LIBOr. In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate90

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
—(Continued) May 31,
 2021  
swap
 agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable onthese
 senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOr. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical  terms of the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes 
that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates . We
 have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC815.
 The changes in fair values of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2025 Notes are recognized as interest expense andnon-operating income, net
 in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in non-current assets or non-current liabilitiesin our consolidated balance sheets.
The
 changes  in  fair  values  of  our  interest  rate  swap  agreements  associated  with  our  July  2021  Notes  are  recognized  as interest  expense  in  our  consolidatedstatements
 of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Theamount
 of net gain (loss) attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense and amount of net gain (loss) attributable to theforeign
 exchange  risk  being  hedged,  as  applicable,  is  recognized  as  non-operating  income,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  with  thecorresponding
 amount included in notes payable, current or notes payable, non-current. We exclude the portion of the change in fair value of cross-currencyinterest rate swap
 agreements attributable to the related cross-currency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in fair value of thesecross-currency
 interest rate swap agreements attributable to the cross-currency basis spread is included in AOCL. The periodic interest settlements for the swapagreements
 for the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities andcash flows that pertain to the principal balance are
 classified as financing activities.Cash Flow Hedges
— Cross-Currency Swap AgreementsIn
 connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currencyexchange
 risk  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro-denominated  January  2021  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  ofprincipal
 at  maturity,  to  a  fixed-rate  of  3.53%  and  U.S.  Dollar-denominated  principal  amount  of  $1.6  billion.  We  had  designated  these  cross-currency  swapagreements
 as  qualifying  hedging  instruments  and  accounted  for  these  as  cash  flow  hedges  pursuant  to  ASC  815.  In  fiscal  2021,  the  cross-currency  swapagreements
 and the January 2021 Notes matured and were settled in cash. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertained to theperiodic
 interest  settlements  were  classified  as  operating  activities  and  the  cash  flows  that  pertained  to  the  principal  balance  were  classified  as  financingactivities.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as 
HedgesWe
 transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risksassociated
 with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or
 decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolati
lity associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany
 sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Ourforeign
 currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generallydepend
 on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in thoserates, the net realized and unrealized gains or l
osses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.91

We do not
 designate  these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of theend
 of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balancesheet
 classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other currentliabilities
 for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net
 for both realized and unrealized gains and l osses.As
 of  May  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  notional  amounts  of  the  forward  contracts  we  held  to  purchase  U.S.  Dollars  in  exchange  for  other  major  internationalcurrencies were
 $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other majorinternational
 currencies were $4.5 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal atMay 31, 2021 and 2020. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activit
ies.The effects

LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES Leases
We
 have operating leases that primarily relate to certain of our facilities, data centers and vehicles. As of May 31, 2021, our operating leases substantially haveremaining terms of one year to eleven 
years, some of which include options to extend and/or terminate the leases.Operating
 lease expenses totaled $654 million, net of sublease income of $13 million in fiscal 2021 and $599 million, net of sublease income of $16 million infiscal 2020. At
 May 31, 2021, rOU assets, current lease liabilities and non-current lease liabilities for our operating leases were $2.6 billion, $664 million and $2.1billion,
 respectively.  We  recorded  rOU  assets  of  $1.7  billion  in  exchange  for  operating  lease  obligations  during  the  year  ended  May  31,  2021.  Cash  paid  foramounts
 included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $696 million for year ended May 31, 2021. As of May 31, 2021, the weighted averageremaining lease term for operating
 leases was approximately seven years and the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligationswas
 2.8%. As of May 31, 2021, we have $653 million of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data centers, that commence in fiscal 2022 forterms of one to eleven years that 
were not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2021 or in the maturities table below.93

Unconditional Obligations
In
 the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable andlegally
 binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximatetiming
 of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies, perform final assemblies and perform testing of our hardwareproducts.
 We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Suchpurchase
 commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times
 and/or  commercially  standard  lead-times  for  the  particular  part  or  product  and  have  been  included  in  the  amounts  disclosed  below.  Certain  routinearrangements
 for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in theordinary

Guarantees
Our
 cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe athird
 party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any materialliabilities
 related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customersagainst liabil
ities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under theseindemnification agreements due to our

limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification cla
ims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.Our Oracle
 Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreementduring the service period.
 Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in theapplicable program documentation for a period of one 
year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent withindustry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of
 the services.We
 occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, amongothers,
 guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had amaterial effect on our results of operat
ions, financial position or cash flows.    In
 connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a court and entered into related indemnification agreements witheach of the surety bond issuing companies. Additional information is prov

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has approved a program fo
r us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 10, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directorsapproved
 an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $20.0 billion. As  of May 31, 2021, approximately  $15.6 billion remained available forstock
 repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion (including  0.8 million shares for $66 millionthat
 were  repurchased  but  not  settled),  361.0  million  shares  for  $19.2  billion,  and  733.8  million  shares  for  $36.0  billion  in  fiscal  2021,  2020  and  2019,respectively, under the stock repurchase program.
Our
 stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capitalneeds, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and
 economicand
 market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Dividends on Common Stock
During
 fiscal  2021,  2020  and  2019,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  cash  dividends  of  $1.04,  $0.96  and  $0.81  per  share  of  our  outstanding  common  stock,respectively, which we paid during the same period.
In
 June 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 29,2021 to
 stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2021. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and paymentdates are subject to the final determination of our Bo
ard of Directors.95

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Stock Plans
In
 fiscal 2021, we adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) to replace the Amended and restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000Plan
 and, together with the 2020 Plan, the Plans) which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restricted stock-based awards,non-qualified
 stock options and incentive stock options, as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligible employees, officers anddirectors who are also employees
 or consultants, independent consultants and advisers.The
 total number of shares authorized under the 2020 Plan is (i) 90 million shares, plus (ii) the number of shares that remained unissued and were available forgrant
 under the 2000 Plan as of the date of adoption of the 2020 Plan, plus (iii) the number of shares granted and outstanding as of the date of adoption of the2020
 Plan which would have been available again for issuance under the terms of the 2000 Plan had the 2020 Plan not been adopted. Under the Plans, for eachshare granted as a full value
 award in the form of a restricted stock unit (rSU) or a performance-based restricted stock award (PSU), an equivalent of 2.5 shares isdeducted from our pool of shares available f
or grant.As of
 May 31, 2021, 107 million unvested restricted stock units (rSUs), 36 million performance-based stock options (PSOs), and service-based stock options (SOs)to
 purchase 69 million shares of common stock, of which 66 million shares were vested, were outstanding under the Plans. Approximately 210 million shares ofcommon
 stock were available for future awards under the 2020 Plan as of May 31, 2021. To date, we have not issued any stock options under the 2020 Plan orany stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans.
The
 vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. rSUs generally requireservice-based
 vesting of 25% annually over four years. SOs were previously granted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value, become exercisablegenerally 25% annually over four years
 of service, and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant.PSOs
 granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consisted of seven numerically equivalent vestingtranches
 that potentially may vest. One tranche vests solely on the attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six tranches require the attainment ofboth a
 performance metric and a market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capitalization metrics forthe
 PSOs  may  be  achieved  at  any  time  during  the  required  performance  period,  assuming  continued  employment  and  service  through  the  date  theCompensation
 Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparisonto
 the  typical  ten  year  contractual  lives  for  SOs.  For  the  six  tranches  of  the  PSOs  with  both  performance  and  market  conditions,  stock-based  compensationexpense
 is to be recognized starting at the time each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service periodor derived service period. Stock-based compensation associated with

determined
 to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period when such a determination is made.  Stock-based
 compensation  for  the  market-based  tranche  was  recognized  using  the  derived  service  period  for  the  market-based  metric  achievement,  which  weestimated to be approximately
 three years. In
 connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’srespective
 stock  plans,  or  we  substituted  substantially  similar  awards  under  the  Plans.  These  restricted  stock-based  awards  and  stock  options  assumed  orsubstituted
 generally retained all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2021, stockoptions to purchase approximately 1 mill
ion shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.In
 fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of rSUs and other stock-based awards,including
 non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of theDirectors’
 Plan,  10  million  shares  of  common  stock  are  reserved  for  issuance (including  a  fiscal  2013  amendment  to  increase  the  number  of  shares  of  ourcommon stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares).
 In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, andexpire no more than 10 years from the date of
 grant. Currently, we only grant rSUs that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’Plan
 was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automaticgrants
 of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants forchairing
 certain  Board  committees,  subject  to  certain  stockholder  approved  limitations  set  forth  in  the  Directors’  Plan.  In  April  2020,  the  CompensationCommittee reduced the maximum
 value of the annual automatic rSU grants to each non-employee director from $400,000 to $350,000 and eliminated all equitygrants
 for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2021, approximately 49,000 unvested rSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares ofcommon
 stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2021, approximately 1 million shares were available forfuture stock awards under this plan.
The
 following  table  summarizes  restricted  stock-based  award  activity  granted  pursuant  to  Oracle-based  stock  plans  and  stock  plans  assumed  from  ouracquisitions for our last three fiscal

zed by us were $842 million, $638 million and $692 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fairmarket
 value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2021, 42 million shares were reserved for future issuances under thePurchase Plan. We issued 2 million shares in each of f
iscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the Purchase Plan.Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement
 PlansWe
 offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $380 million, $376 million and$380 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In
 the  U.S.,  regular  employees  can  participate  in  the  Oracle  Corporation  401(k)  Savings  and  Investment  Plan  (Oracle  401(k)  Plan).  Participants  can  generallycontribute
 up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit asdefined
 by the U.S. Internal revenue Service (IrS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period,subject
 to maximum aggregate matching  amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k)  Plan, net  of forfeitures, were $150  million, $152  million and  $154million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We
 also  offer  non-qualified  deferred  compensation  plans  to  certain  employees  whereby  they  may  defer  a  portion  of  their  annual  base  and/or  variablecompensation
 until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were eachapproximately $813 million and approximate

INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rates for each of the peri
ods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of incometax
 rates.  Our  provision  for  income  taxes  for  fiscal  2021  varied  from  the  tax  computed  at  the  U.S.  federal  statutory  income  tax  rate  primarily  due  to  a  netdeferred
 tax benefit that totaled $2.3 billion that we recognized as a result of a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-grouptransfer of
 certain intellectual property (IP) rights, earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with taxauthorities,
 the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of GILTI. Our provision for incometaxes
 for fiscal 2020 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, theU.S.
 research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Incomededuction
 and the tax effect of GILTI. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts andJobs
 Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with taxauthorities,
 the  tax  effects  of  stock-based  compensation,  the  Foreign  Derived  Intangible  Income  deduction,  GILTI,  and  a  $389  million  net  reduction  to  ourtransition tax recorded in connection with the Tax Act pursuant to SEC St

We
 provide for United States income taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries unless theyare
 considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2021, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings andother
 outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.9billion.
 If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits thatwould reduce the federal tax liabil
ity associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2021, assuming a full utilization of theforeign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liabi
lity associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $1.4 billion.Our
 net deferred tax assets were $5.8 billion and $3.2 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the netdeferred
 tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxableincome
 in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and taxcredit carryforwa
rds. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable incomechange.
The
 valuation allowance was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2021and 2020 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allow
ance andthe recognition of the associated tax benefits associ
ated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes102

 May  31,  2021,  we  had  federal  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of  approximately  $502  million,  which  are  subject  to  limitation  on  their  utilization.Approximately
 $447 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $55 million of thesefederal net
 operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion at May 31,2021, which
 expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2040 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards ofapproximately
 $1.8 billion at May 31, 2021, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net operating lossesare
 not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $86 million, expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal2041.
 At  May  31,  2021,  we  had  federal  capital  loss  carryforwards  of  approximately  $501  million,  which  expire  in  fiscal  2026.  We  had  state  capital  losscarryforwards
 of approximately $661 million, which expire between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion atMay
 31,  2021,  which  are  subject  to  limitations  on  their  utilization.  Approximately  $765  million  of  these  tax  credit  carryforwards  are  not  currently  subject  toexpiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carr
yforwards, approximately $378 million, expire in various years between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2041.We
 classify  our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  as  either  current  or  non-current  income  taxes  payable  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Theaggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follo

As
 of May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $4.4 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate ifrecognized.
 We  recognized  interest  and  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  line  of  our  consolidated  statements  ofoperations
 of $166 million, $202 million and $312 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2021 and2020 were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
Domestically,
 U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal2019.
 Many issues are at an advanced  stage in the examination process,  the most significant of which include  transfer pricing,  domestic production  activity,foreign
 tax credits, research and development credits, state economic nexus, and qualification as a state manufacturer. With all of these domestic audit issuesconsidered
 in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2021, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these auditscould
 decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $798 million ($671 million net of offsetting taxbenefits).
 Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and, with some exceptions, we are no longer subject to auditfor those periods. Our U.S. state
 income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007, and we are no longer subject toaudit for those periods.

Internationally,
 tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it wasreasonably
 possible that, as of May 31, 2021, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by asmuch
 as  $197  million  ($89  million  net  of  offsetting  tax  benefits)  in  the  next  12  months  related  primarily  to  transfer  pricing.  With  some  exceptions,  we  aregenerally no longer subject to tax examinati
ons in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.We
 are under audit by the IrS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved invarious
 challenges  and  litigation  in  a  number  of  countries,  including,  in  particular,  Australia,  Brazil,  Canada,  India,  Indonesia,  Israel,  Mexico,  New  zealand,Pakistan,
 Saudi  Arabia, South  Korea  and  Spain,  where the  amounts under  controversy  are significant. In  some, although  not all,  cases,  we have  reserved  forpotential
 adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with,these
 tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedingswill not have
 a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilitieswould
 result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreignincome tax liabilities 
and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.We
 believe  that  we  have  adequately  provided  under  GAAP  for  outcomes  related  to  our  tax  audits.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurances  as  to  the  possibleoutcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof.

SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC
 280, Segment Reporting ,  establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of anenterprise
 about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, indeciding
 how  to  allocate  resources  and  in  assessing  performance.  Our  chief  operating  decision  makers  (CODMs)  are  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  ChiefTechnology
 Officer.  We  are  organized  by  line  of  business  and  geographically.  While  our  CODMs  evaluate  results  in  a  number  of  different  ways,  the  line  ofbusiness
 management  structure  is  the  primary  basis  for  which  the  allocation  of  resources  and  financial  results  are  assessed.  The  tabular  information  belowpresents
 the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocatingcompany resources.
We
 have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a single  operating  segment. All three of our businessesmarket
 and  sell  our  offerings  globally  to  businesses  of  many  sizes,  government  agencies,  educational  institutions  and  resellers  with  a  worldwide  sales  forcepositioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.
Our
 cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise
 deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud servicesand
 license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered tocustomers
 over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms.Cloud
 services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as theybecome
 available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term. Cloud license and on-premise
 license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and ourapplications
 software  products  within  cloud  and  on-premise  IT  environments.  We  generally  recognize  revenues  at  the  point  in  time  the  software  is  madeavailable to the customer to downl
oad and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each fiscal year, our cloud and license104

business’ contractual activit
ies are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in thefirst fiscal quarter of the next fiscal 
year) as we receive payments from these contracts. Our
 hardware business  provides Oracle Engineered  Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific  hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management  andother
 hardware-related  software  to  support  diverse  IT  environments.  Our  hardware  business  also  offers  hardware  support,  which  provides  customers  withsoftware
 updates  for  the  software  components  that  are  essential  to  the  functionality  of  their  hardware  products,  such  as  Oracle  Solaris  and  certain  othersoftware, and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Our
 services  business  provides  services  to  customers  and  partners  to  help  maximize  the  performance  of  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  andinfrastructure technologies.
We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not
 practical to show assets by operating segment.The following table presents summary results for e

We have
 considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance, and disclosures presented outside of our financialstatements
 in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty ofrevenues
 and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services aspresented in our 
consolidated statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as per the preceding tables ofthis footnote.
The
 following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region. The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region aspresented in the table below was material

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic
 earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.Diluted earnings per share

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation
On
 June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of SantaClara
 against  Oracle  Corporation  alleging  numerous  causes  of  action  including  breach  of  contract,  breach  of  the  covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing,defamation,
 intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint allegedthat
 when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, itbreached
 a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 (the HP Settlement Agreement), resolving litigation between HP and one of Oracle’s formerCEOs
 who had previously acted as HP’s chief executive officer and chairman of HP’s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights andobligations under the HP Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. 
Oracle answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.After
 a bench trial on the meaning of the HP Settlement Agreement, the court found that the HP Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to developcertain of its soft
ware products for use on HP’s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP. The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016. On June 30, 2016, the juryreturned
 a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on itscross-claims.
 The jury awarded HP $3.0 billion in damages. Under the court’s rulings, HP is entitled to post-judgment interest, but not pre-judgment interest, onthis award.
After the trial court denied Or
acle’s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal ofthe
 trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest. Oral argument was held on May 27, 2021. On June 14, 2021, the Court of Appeal affirmed both the judgmentagainst
 Oracle noted above, and the denial of pre-judgment interest. Oracle has posted a mandated surety bond with the trial court for the amounts owing. Noamounts
 have been paid or recorded to our results of operations. If the Court of Appeal’s judgment is ultimately affirmed, we would be liable for the amount ofthe jury award that is described above plus post-judgment interest.
We
 continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HP’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them including our intention to petitionfor review by the California
 Supreme Court.We
 cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding this process and the natureof
 the claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of the process related to this action is uncertain. It is possible that the resolution of thisaction could have a material impact 
on our future cash flows and results of operations.Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracl
e’s NetSuite AcquisitionOn
 May  3  and  July  18,  2017,  two  alleged  stockholders  filed  separate  derivative  lawsuits  in  the  Court  of  Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  purportedly  onOracle’s
 behalf.  Thereafter,  the  court  consolidated  the  two  derivative  cases  and  designated  the  July  18,  2017  complaint  as  the  operative  complaint.  Theconsolidated
 lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.Plaintiff
 alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. Thecomplaint
 sought (and the operative complaint continues to seek) declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees andcosts. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied on March 19, 2018.
On
 May 4, 2018, our Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-employee
 directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiff should be allowed toproceed with the derivative litigation on behalf 
of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had fulfilled its duties and108

obligations, the Board withdrew the SLC’s authority, except that the SLC m
aintained certain authority to respond to discovery requests in the litigation. After
 plaintiff filed the July 18, 2017 complaint, an additional plaintiff joined the case. Plaintiffs filed several amended complaints, and filed their most recentamended
 complaint on December 11, 2020. The operative complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against our Chief Executive Officer, our ChiefTechnology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd
 (our former Chief Executive Officer who passed away on October 18, 2019), and two other members of our Board ofDirectors.
 Oracle is named  as a nominal defendant.  On December  11,  2020,  the  estate of Mark Hurd  and  the  two other members  of our Board of Directorsmoved
 to dismiss this complaint, and a hearing on this motion was held on February 16, 2021. The court has not yet ruled on this motion. On December 28,2020, our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, and Oracle as a
 nominal defendant filed answers to the operative complaint.The parties are conducting discovery. Trial is scheduled to commence on July 18, 2022.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, 
we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Securities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concernin
g Oracle’s Cloud BusinessOn
 August 10, 2018, a putative class action, brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Californiaagainst
 us, our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, two other Oracle executives, and one former Oracle executive. As noted above,Mr.
 Hurd,  one of our then-two  Chief Executive  Officers,  passed  away on October  18, 2019.  On March  8, 2019,  plaintiff  filed an amended  complaint.  Plaintiffalleges
 that  the  defendants  made  or  are  responsible  for  false  and  misleading  statements  regarding  Oracle’s  cloud  business.  Plaintiff  further  alleges  that  theformer
 Oracle executive engaged in insider trading. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees andcosts,
 and unspecified declaratory/injunctive relief. On April 19, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint. On December 17, 2019, thecourt granted this motion, giving
 plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint, which plaintiff filed on February 17, 2020. On April 23, 2020, defendantsfiled
 a motion to dismiss, and the court held a hearing on this motion on September 24, 2020. On March 22, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in partthis
 motion. The court dismissed the action as to one Oracle executive and the former Oracle executive. The court permitted plaintiff to proceed with only anarrow
 omissions theory against the remaining defendants. On April 21, 2021, defendants filed an answer to the complaint. Trial is scheduled to commence onNovember 6, 2023.  We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this acti
on, and we will continue to vigorously defend it.On
 February 12 and May 8, 2019, two stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Thecases
 were consolidated, and on July 8, 2019, a single plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. The consolidated complaint brought various claims relating to the10b-5 class action describe
d immediately above. The parties agreed to stay the derivative case pending resolution of defendants’ motion to dismiss the securitiescase, which the court granted in part and denied in part on March 22, 2021.
Plaintiff
 filed an amended complaint on June 4, 2021. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, againstour
 Chief  Technology  Officer,  our  Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  the  estate  of  Mark  Hurd.  Plaintiff  claims  that  the  alleged  actions  described  in  the  class  actiondiscussed
 above caused harm to Oracle, and that defendants violated their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith, loyalty, and due care by failing to prevent thisalleged
 harm. Plaintiff also brings derivative claims for violations of federal securities laws.  Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivativeaction,
 a finding that defendants are liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, damages, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’fees
 and costs, and unspecified relief. On June 14, 2021, the court “so ordered” a stipulation from the parties, staying this case pending resolution of the 10b-5action.

e’s Board Composition and Hiring PracticesOn
 July 2 and 10, 2020, two alleged stockholders filed derivative lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on Oracle’sbehalf,
 and thereafter, filed a consolidated complaint on August 21, 2020. On July 30, 2020, a third alleged stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit in the samecourt. On October 16, 2020, defendants moved to consolidate all these actions, and the court granted this motion on November 30, 2020.
On
 December 7, 2020, plaintiffs filed a consolidated derivative complaint against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant,seeking
 declaratory  and  injunctive  relief,  monetary  damages,  interest,  corporate  governance  changes,  disgorgement,  restitution,  punitive  damages,  and  anaward
 of  attorneys’  fees,  expert  fees,  and  costs.  Plaintiffs  allege  that:  (a)  defendants  breached  their  fiduciary  duties  by  permitting  Oracle  to  violate  anti-discrimination
 laws and Oracle’s own policies, failing to ensure sufficient diversity on the board, failing to ensure an independent board chairman, rehiring Ernst&
 Young LLP as Oracle’s auditors, and by breaching the HP Settlement Agreement (discussed above); (b)  defendants made false and misleading statements inOracle’s
 proxy statements; (c) defendants received unjust compensation and were unjustly enriched; (d) defendants aided and abetted this conduct; and (e) ourChief Technology
 Officer and our Chief Executive Officer are liable for abuse of control. On January 6, 2021, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On May24, 2021, the court granted defendants’ motion. regarding the claims concerning Oracle’s proxy statements, the court granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended
complaint within 30 days. regarding the remaining claims, the court granted plaintiffs leave t
o re-file those claims in Delaware Chancery Court.While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, 
we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Other Litigation

 claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matterscannot
