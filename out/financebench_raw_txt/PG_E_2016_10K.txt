BUSINESS
 
PG&E Corporation, incorporated in Cal
ifornia in 1995, is a holding company whose primary op erating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a publicutility operating in nor
thern and central California.  The Utility was incorporated in California in 1905.  PG&E Corporation became the holding comp any of the Utility and its subsidiari
es in 1997.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.  PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s operating revenues, income, and total assets can be fou nd below in Item 6. Selected Financ ial Data. 
The principal executiv
e offices of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are located at 77 Beale Street, P.O.   Box 770000, San Francisco, California   94177.  PG&ECorporation’s telephone numbe
r is (415) 973-1000 and t he Utility’s telephone numb er is (415)   973-7000. 
At December 31, 201 
6 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility had approximately 24,000 regular employees, approximately 30 of which were employees of PG&ECorporation 
.  Of the Utility’s regular employees, approximately 14,000 are covered by collec tive bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three labor unions: the International Broth
erhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”); the Engineers and Scientists of California (“ESC”); and the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU” 
).  A new SEIU collective bargaining agreement was ratified in December 2016 and is effective August 1, 2016 through December 31, 2019.  T wo newagreements (Physical 
and Clerical) with IBEW and an agreement with ESC were rati fie d in 2016 and were retroactiv e to January 1, 2016.  They will expire onDecember 31, 2019. 
 
This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K fo
r PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Annual Reports on Form   10-K,Quarterly R 
eports on Form   10-Q, Current Reports on Form   8-K, and proxy statements, are available free of charge on both PG&E Corporation's website,www.pgecorp.com
, and the Utility's website, www.pge.com
 , as promptly as practic able after they are filed with, or furni shed to, the SEC .  Additionally, PG&ECorporation and the Utility 
routinely provide links to the Utility ’s regulatory proceedings before the CPUC and the FERC at http://investor.pgecorp.com
 , under the “Regulatory Filings” tab, so tha
t such filings are availab le to investors upon filing with the relevan t agency.  It is possible that these regulatory filings or informationincluded therein could be d
eemed to be material information.  The information contained on these websites is not part of this or any other report that PG&ECorporation or th 
e Utility files with, or fu rnishes to, the SEC. 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward
-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  For a discussion of thesignificant risks that co
uld affect the outcome o f these forward-looking sta tements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition and results ofoperations, see “Item 1A. Risk Fac
tors” and the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” in MD&A. 
Regulatory
Environment

  
The 
Utility's business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.  At the state level, the Utility is regulatedprimarily by the CPUC.  At the federa
l level, the Utility is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements of otherfederal, state and lo
cal regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment , and health. This section and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms” section belowsummarize some o 
f the more significan t laws, regulations, and regulatory proc eedings affecting the Ut ility. 
PG&E Corporation is a “public util
ity holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversight by the FERC.  PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries ar
e exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than the obligation toprovide access to their books 
and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes. 
The
California
Public
Utilities
Commission 
The CPUC is a regulatory agency that r
egulates privately owned public utilities in California.  The CPUC consists of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of California and confir
med by the California State Senate for staggered six-y ear terms.  The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions of servi ce for the Utility's electric 
and natural gas dist ribution operations, electric generation, and natural g as transmission and storage services.  The CPUC also has jurisdiction over the Utility's issuances o
f securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility's electricity and natural gas retailcustomers, rates of re
turn, rates of depreciation, over sight of nuclear decomm issioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providing electric and natural gasutility service.
 
8
 

 The CPUC enforces state laws and regula
tions that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, t esting, operation, and main tenance of utilitygas and electric facilities. 
  The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $50,000 per day, per violation, for v iolations that occurred after January 1, 2012.  (The statutorymaximum penalty for vio
lations that occur red before January 1, 2012 is $20,000 per v iolation.)  The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penaltiesbased on the totality of th
e circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the vio lations and the number of pe rsonsaffected; and the good f
aith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC also is required to consider theappropriateness of the a
mount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.   
The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issu
e citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports.  Underboth the gas and electri
c programs, the SED has discretion wheth er to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required toimpose the maximum sta
tutory penalty of $50,000.  The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, fo r violations that continued for more than one d
ay.  In September 2016, the CPUC adopted improvements and refin ements to its gas and electric safety citation programs.  Specifically,the final decision re
fines the criteria for the SED to use in determining whether to issue a citat ion and the amount of penalty, sets an administrative limit of $8 millionper citation issued, make
s self-reporting voluntary in both gas and electric programs, adopts detailed criteria for the utilities to use to voluntarily self-r eport a potential violation, and refines oth
er issues in the programs.  The decision also merges th e rules applicable to its gas and electric safety citation programs into a single set ofrules that replace 
s the previous safety citation programs .  
The Cal 
ifornia State Legislature also dire cts the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to increasing renewable energy resources, thedevelopment and widespread dep
loyment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the establishment of energy storage procurement targets 
, and the development  of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  T he CPUC is responsible for approving funding and administrationof state-mandated public p 
urpose programs such as energy e fficiency and other customer programs.  The CPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Utility’saccounting, performance 
, and compliance with regulatory guidelines .  
T 
he CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Ut ility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financial conditionsthat require PG&E Corporation’s Boa
rd of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary a nd prudent to meet the Utility's obligation to s
erve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in MD&Aand Item 1A. Risk Factors.) 
  
The
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
and
the
California
Independent
Syst em
Operator 
The FERC has jurisdictio 
n over the Utility's elec tric transmission revenue requ irements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility's hydroelectricgeneration facilities, and the
 interstate sale and transportation o f natural gas. The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s transmission systems with other electric system and generation
 facilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesa le electricitysales.  
The FERC also is charged with adopting and enfo rcing mandatory standards governing the reliabi lity of the nation’s electric transmission grid, including standards to protect the n
ation’s bulk power system a gainst potential disrupt ions from cyber and physical security breaches.  The FERC has authority to impose fines of up to $1 million per day for v
iolation s of certain federal statutes and regulations. 
The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmiss
ion org anization for the Util ity’s service territory.  The CAISO controls the operation of the electric transmission system in Cali
fornia and provides open access transmission service on a non - discriminatory basis.  The CAISO also is responsible for planning transmission system additions, ensur
ing the maintenance of adequate reserves of gen erating capacity, and ensuring tha t the reliability of the transmission system ismaintained.
 
The
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
 
The NRC oversees the licensing, constru
ction, operation and decommission ing of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at DiabloCanyon and the Utility’s reti
red nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay.  (See “Electric ity Resources” below.)  NRC regulations require ext ensive monitoring and review of the safety, rad
iological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority toimpose fines or to force 
a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both.  NRC safety and security requireme nts have, in the past, necessitated substantial capital expenditures atDiablo Canyon, and substantial capi
tal expenditures could be required in the future.   (For more information abou t Diablo Canyon, see “Regulatory Matters – Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Fac
tors below.)

 Other
Regula
tors 
The CEC 
is the state's primary energy policy and planning agency.  The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.  The CEC also is responsible for fore
casts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities' electricity procurement plans and for adopting building and applianc
e energy efficiency requirements.
The CARB 
is the state agency responsible for setting and monitoring GHG and other e mission limits.  The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcingregulations to implem
ent state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California.  (See “Environmental Regu lation - Air Quality and ClimateChange” below.)
 
In addition, the Utility obt
ains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility's generation facilities, electricitytransmission lines, natur
al gas t ransportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities.  The Utility also periodically obtains permits, authorizations, andlicenses in connection with d
istribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use p ublic property for the ope ration of the Utility'sbusiness and to conduct certa
in related operations.  The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties that permit the Utility to install,operate, and maintain 
the Utility's e lectric and natural gas facilities i n the public streets and highway s.  In exchange for the right to use public streets and highway s, the Utility pays annual fe
es to the cities and counties.  In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an ind eterminate ter m, with no expiration date. 
Ratemaking
Mechanisms
 
The Utility’s rates for electricit
y and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service includinga return on 
invested capital (“ cost-of-service ratemaking”).  Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the annual amount thatthe Utility will be author
ized to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”).  The Utility’s reve nue requirements consist p rimarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to 
recover its reasonabl e operating expenses ( e.g., maintenance, adminis tration and general expenses) and capital costs ( e.g., depreciation, tax, and financing expenses).  In add 
ition, the CPUC authorizes the Utili ty to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass-through” to customers (referred to as “Uti
lity Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in MD&A) , including its costs to procur e electr icity, natural gas and nuc lear fuel, toadminister public purpose 
and customer programs, and to decommission its nuclear facilities. 
The Utility’s rate of r
eturn on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings.  The authorized rat e of return on all other Utility assets is set in the CPUC’s cost of capital proceed
ing.  Other than its electric transmission and certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base revenues are“decoupled” from its sa
les volume.  Regulatory balancing accounts, or rev enue adjustment mechanisms, ensure that the Utility will fully collect its authorized baserevenue requirements.  Th
e Utility’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impact 
ed Earnings” in MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements. 
Both electric and gas ra
tes vary depending on seasons mostly due to the influence of weather.   Electricity rates increase during the summer mo nths ( May – October)because of higher 
demand, driven by air conditioning lo ads , while gas service rates generally increase during the winter months ( November – March) to account for the gas peak due to heating.
 
During 201 
6 , the CPUC continued to impleme nt state law requirements t o reform residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of service,reduce cross-subsidizatio
n among customer rate classe s, implement new rules for net energy metering (which currently allow ce rtai n self-generating custo mers toreceive bill cred
its for surplus power at the full retail rate) , and allow customers to have gr eater control over their energy use.  (See “Legislative and RegulatoryInitiatives” in MD&A for 
more information on specifi c CPUC proceedings . ) 
From time to time, the CPUC may use in
centive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues.  For example, theUtility has earned incenti
ves for the successful im plementation of e nergy efficiency progr ams.  (See “Regulatory Matters – 2014 – 2015 Energy Efficiency Incen tiveAwards” in MD&A.)

 Base Revenues
 
General
Rate
Cases
 
The GRC is the primary proceeding in whi
ch the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requ irements that the Utility is authorized to collect from customers torecover the Utility’s anticipate
d costs, including return on rate base, related to its electricity distribution, natural gas distribution , and Utility owned ele ctricity generation operations.  The CPUC genera
lly conducts a GRC every three or four years.  The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year (or“test year”) of the GRC period 
and typically authorizes the Util ity to receive annual in creases in revenue requiremen ts for the subsequent years of the GRC period(know

Cases
 
The CPUC determines the Utility’s au
thorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage se rvices in the GT&S rate case.   The CPUCgenerally conducts a GT&S rat
e case every three or four years.   Similar to the GRC proceeding, t he CPUC approves the annual revenue requi rements for the firstyear (or “test year
”) of the G T&S period and typically determines annual i ncreases in revenue requirements for attrition years of the GT&S period.   Parties in theUtility's GT&S rate case inc
lude the ORA and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as other interveno rs who representother business, community, custo

Cost
of
Capital
Proceedings
 
The CPUC periodica 
lly conducts a cost of capital proceeding to authorize the Utility's capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric andnatural gas distribution, 
and natural gas transmission and storage rate base.  The CPUC has authorized the Utility’s capital st ructure through 2017, consisting of 52%common equity, 47% long-ter
m debt, and 1% preferred stock.  The CPUC also set the authorized ROE through 2017 at 10.40%.  The CPUC adopted an adjustmentmechanism to allow the Uti
lity’s capital st ructure and ROE to be adjusted if the utility bond index changes by certain thresholds on an annual basis.  On February 25,2016, the CPUC issued a decision granting a pet
ition for modification filed by the Utility and the other California IOUs to clarify that the CPUC’s previously adopted cost of capital adjust
ment mechanism would not be triggered for 2017. 
On February 6, 2017, the Utility and other Ca
lifornia IOUs entered into a MOU with the CPUC, ORA, and TURN to extend the next cost of capital applica tion filing deadline two years to April 22, 2019 fo
r the year 2020.  To implement the MOU, on February 7, 2016, the IOUs, ORA, and TURN filed with the CPUC a petition formodification of prior CPUC decisions 
addressing cost of capital.  If the petition for modification is approved as submitted it would reduce the Utility’s ROE from10.40% to 10.25% and reset the Util
ity’s authorized cost of long-term debt and preferred stock beginning January 1, 2018.  The Utility’s current capital structure of52% common e 
quity, 47% long-term debt, and 1 % preferred equity would remain unchanged.  The Utility’s cost of capital adjustment mechanism would not operatein 2017 but could operate in 2018 to ch
ange the cost of capital for 2019.  If the mechanism is activated for 20 19, the Utility’s cost of cap ital, including its new ROEof 10.25%, will be adjusted acco
rding to the existing terms of the mechanism.  Concurrently with the petition for modification, the Utility and other California IOUsalso sent a letter to 
the executi ve director of the CPUC requesting th at the existing April 2017 filing due date for the 2018 cost of capital be deferred while the CPUCis considering the petit
ion for modification.  On February 13, 2017, the executive director of the CPUC granted the requ est.  As extended, the Utility and the otherCalifornia IOUs would file thei
r next cost of capital applications 60 days after the effective date of the CPUC decision on the petition for modification, or April 20,2017, whichever is later, if 
the CPUC does not grant the petition fo r modification. 
The Utility expects that 
the CPUC may issue a decision in the first half of 2017.  (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters –CPUC Cost of Capital” in MD&A.)

Owner
Rate
Cases
 
The 
FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirement s , including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in ratesin the TO rate case.  The Util
ity generally files a TO rate case every year.  The FERC typica lly authorizes the Util ity to charge new rates based on the requestedrevenue requirement, sub
ject to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision.  These FERC-approved rates are included : 1) by the CPUC in the Utility's retailelectric rates and ar 
e collected from retail electric customers ; and 2) by the CAISO in its Transmission Access Cha rges to wholesale customers .  ( For moreinformation, s 
ee “ Regulatory Matters – FERC Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in MD&A.)  The Utility also recovers a portion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric 
transmission costs through charges collected under specific contracts with wholesale transmission customers that the Utility entered into before theCAISO began its operations.  These wholesale 
custome rs are charged individualize d rates based on the terms of their contracts. 
Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through Costs

Electricity
Procurement
Costs
 
California investor-ow
ned electric utilities are responsible for procuring elec trical capacity required to meet b undled customer demand, plus applicable reservemargins, that are not sati
sfied from their own generation facilities and existing electricity contracts.  The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources, inclu
ding certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources are theleast expensive (i.e., using 
the principles of “least-cost dispatch”).  In addition, the u tilities are requ ired to obtain CPUC approval of their bundled customerprocurement plans based on long
-term demand forecasts.  The Utility’s most recent bundled customer procurement plan was approved in October 2015, and willremain in effect until the pl 
an is superseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan.  
California law allows ele
ctric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved bundled customer procurement plans without furtherafter-the-fac
t reasonableness review by the CPUC.  The CPUC may disallow costs associated with ele ctricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliancewith the CPUC-approved plan or if the CPUC determin
es that the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch.  Addit ionally, the cost of repl acementpower procured due to unplanned outag
es at Utility owned generation facilities may be disallowed. 
The Utility recovers its 
electricity procurement costs annually primarily through the energy resource recovery account.  (Se e Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidat edFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.)  Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivativeinstruments, GHG emissions costs, and gene
ration fuel expens e, and approves a forecast ed revenue requirement.  The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electricityrates more frequently if the f
orecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the energy resource recovery account exceed 5% of its prior y ear electricity procurement and utili
ty-owned generation revenues.  The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the energy resource recoveryaccount.
 
The CPUC has approved various power purchase agre
ements that the Utilit y has entered into with third p arties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approvedprocurement plan, to meet ma
ndatory renewable energy targets, and to comply with resource adequacy requirements.  (For more information, see “Electric UtilityOperations – 
Electricity Resources ” below as well as Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)
Natural
Gas
Procurement
,
Storage,
 and
Transportation
Costs  
The Utility recovers the 
cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered ann ually through retail electricity rates. 
The Utility sets the 
natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecastedcosts of natural 
gas, core pipeline capa city and storage costs.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost ofderivative instrumen
ts for its core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set fort h in its core procurement  incentive mechanism describedbelow.  The Utility reflec
ts the difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancingaccounts, with under-colle
ctions and ov er-collections tak en into account in subsequent monthly rate changes.  
12
 

 The core procurement incenti
ve mechanism protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for its core gas portfolio. Under the core pr 
ocurement incentive mechanism, the Utility’s natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-basedbenchmark based on a weighted av
erage of published monthly and daily natural gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically pu rchases natural gas.  Coststhat fall within a tol
erance band, which is 99% to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’ rates.  One-halfof the costs above 102% of the ben
chma rk are recoverable in customers’ rates, and the Utility's customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings resulting from theUtility’s cost of natura
l gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark.  The Utility retains the remaining amount of these saving s as incentive revenues, subj ect to a capequal to 1.5% of total natu
ral gas commodity costs.  While this mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural gas, consistent with the market-basedbenchmark, are not expecte
d to materially impact net income.  
The Utility incurs transpor
tation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers.  These providers transportnatural gas from the poin
ts at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mounta ins, and the southwestern United States) tothe points at which the Utili
ty's natural gas transportation system begins.   These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules, and termsof service for the provis
ion of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines.  The FERC approves the United States tariffs thatshippers, including the Utili
ty, pay for pipeline service, and the applicable Canadia n tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board, a Canadian regulatoryagency.  The transportation 
costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas procurement costs or as acost of electrici 
ty.  
Costs
Associated
with
Public
Purpose
and
Customer
Programs

The CPUC authorizes the Utility to re
cover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utilitycustomers. 
  These programs relate to energy efficiency, d emand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters.   Additionally,the CPUC has authorized the Utility to p
rovide a discount rate for low-income customers, known as California Alternate Rates f or Energy (“CARE”), which is subsidized by the Utility’s oth
er customers.
Nuclear
Decommissioning
Costs
 
The Utility's nuclear power f
acilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requir es the safe removal of nuclear facilities from 
service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the propertyfor unrestricted use.  
Nuclear decommissioning  costs are collected in adva nce through rates and are h eld in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventualdecommissioning of each nuc
lear unit.  The Utility files an appl ication with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’s updated estimated deco mmissioning costs and 
any rate change necessa ry to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission the Utility’s nuclear plants. 
On August 11, 2016, the Utility submitted an app
lication to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyo n at the expiration of i ts current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 . (For more information, se
e “ Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” in MD&A.)  
Electric
Utility
Opera
tions 
The Utility generates e
lectricity and provides electricity transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California toresidential, comme
rcial, industrial, and agricultural customers.  The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e. , electricity, transmission and distribution services) tomost customers in its serv
ice territory.  Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generation res 
ources, such as rooftop solar ins tallations. 
The Utility 
has continued to invest in its v ision for a future electric grid which w ill allow customers to choose new, advanced energy supply technologies and servicesto meet their needs cons
istent with safe, reliable and affordable electric service .  In addition, in December 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision estab lishing a three-year EV program 
for the Utility to deploy up to 7,500 charging stations. (For more information, se e “ Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” in MD&A.)

 Electricity Resources
 
The Utility is required
 to maintain generating capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning andoperating reserves, delivera
ble to the locations and at times as may be ne cessary to provide reliable electric service.  The Utility is required to dispatch, or schedule allof the electricity resources 
within its portfolio in the most cost-effective way .

 Renewable
Energy
Resources.
  California law establish ed an RPS that requires load-serving entities, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount ofrenewable energy they del
iver to their customers.  In October 2015, the California Governor signed SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act o f 2015into law.  SB 350 became effect
ive January 1, 2016, and increases the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving entities, including theUtility, to their custom
ers fro m 33% of their total annu al retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by theend of the 2028- 2030 compliance p
eriod, and in each three-year compliance period thereafter, unless changed by legisla tive action.  SB 350 provides compli anceflexibility and waiver mecha
nisms, including increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future complianceperiods.  The Utility will incu
r additional costs to proc ure renewable energy to m eet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to berecoverable from cus
tomers as “pass-through” costs.  The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets.  The CPUC is required to open a new rulemaking proceeding 
to adopt regulations to implement the higher renewable targets.    
As indicated below, 
the Utility’s applica tion and joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon include a voluntary increase in the Utility’s targ et for RPS-eligible resourc esto 55%, effective in 2031 th
rough 2045, as compared to the state’s goal of 50% renewables.   (For more information, see “ Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” inMD&A.)
 
Renewable generation resour
ces, for purposes of the RPS requirements , include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW orless), wind, solar, and geotherm
al energy.  During 201 6 , 32.8 % of the Utility’s energy deliveries were from renewable energy sources, exceeding the annual RPS target of 23.3%.  Approximate
ly 2 8.4 % of the renewable energy delivered to the Utility’s customers was purchased from non-QF third parties.  Additional renewableresources were provided by QFs ( 
2 . 6 %), the Utility’s small hydroelectric facilities ( 1 . 3 %), and the Utility’s solar facilities (0. 5 %). 
The total 201

Energy
Storage.

As required by California law, th e CPUC has opened a proceeding to establish a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, including energystorage procurement 
targets to be achieved by each load-serving entity under the CPUC jurisdiction, including the Utility.  Under the adopted energy storageprocurement framework, 
the Utility is required to procure 580 MW of qualifying storage capacity by 2020, with all energ y storage projects requi red to be operationalby the end of 2024.
 
The CPUC also adopted biennial interi
m storage targets for the Utility, beginning in 2014 and ending in 2020.  Under the adopted framework, the Utility is required toconduct biennial compe 
titive RFOs to help meet its in terim storage targets.  
The Utility conducted an RFO in 2014. The Utili
ty’s 2014 energy storage target was 90 MW, some of which the Utility met through already existing projects, orprojects anticipated to resul 
t from other CPUC proceedings.  As a result of the 2014 RFO, 70 MW of transmission and distribution contracts have been approved bythe CPUC.  Contracts for 6MW were rejec
ted by the CPUC, including a behind-the-meter project.  Additionally, contracts for 13 MW were withdrawn by the Utility.  
15
 

 The Utility’s 2016 energy storag
e target is 120 MW.  On November 30, 2016, the Utility issued its 2016 RFO.  The Utility must submit all executed contracts from the2016 RFO to the CPUC for approval by December 1, 2017 
.  The Utility expects to inc rease the amount of storage it is attempting to procure in its 2016 RFO by theshortfall from the 2014 t

Electricity Transmission 
  
At December 
  31, 201 6 , the Utility owned approximately 18, 400 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500 kV.  The Utility also operated 9 
2 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 64,600 M VA.  The Utility’s electric transmission system is interconnected with el
ectric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Co uncil, which includes many weste rn states, Alberta and British Columbia, andparts of Mexico.
 
In 2013, the Utility, MidAmeric
an Transmission, LLC, and Citizens Energy Corporation were selected by the CAISO to jointly develop a new 230-kV transmissionline to address the growing power de
mand in the Fresno, Madera and Kings counties area.  The CAISO has stated that the 2022 in-service date for the 70-mile line hasbeen p 
ostponed, and has placed the proj ect on hold .  The Utility has stopped all work on th e project pending a decision from the CAISO that could defer or cancelthe project.  A decision by the CAISO is expe
cted by March 2018.   In addition, as a part of the CAISO's 2016-2017 planning efforts, the CAISO co nducted a review of a number of local ar
ea low voltage transmission projects in the Utility’s service territory that were predo minantly load forecas t driven.  As a result of the review, the CAISO found that a number of lower-vol
tage transmission projects were no lo nger required and  recom mended cancelling or requiring further review in the 2017-2018 planning cycle. 
 
On March 29, 2026 the Utility enter
ed into an agreement with TransCanyon, LLC, a joint venture between subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and PinnacleWest Capital Corporation, to 
jointly pursue competative transmission opportunities solicited by the CAISO.  The Utility and TransCanyon intend to jointly engage inthe development of futur
e transmission infastructure and compete to develop, build, own and operate transmission projects approved by the CAISO. 
16
 
 

Throughout 201 6 , the Utility upgraded several critical substations and re-conductored a number of transmission lines to improve maintenance and sy stem flexibility, reliability and saf
ety.  The Utility expects to undertake various additional transmission projects over the next several years to upgrade and expand the capacity of itstransmission system to secu
re access to renewable generation r esource s and replace aging or obsolet e equipment and improve system reliability.  The Utility also hastaken steps to improve the phys
ical security of its transmission substations and equipment. 
Electricity Distribution
 
The Utility's electri
city distribution ne twork consists of a pproximately 142,000 circui t miles of distribution lines (of which approximately 20% are underground andapproximately 80% are ov
erhead), 5 9 transmission switching substations, and 606 distribution substations, with a capacity of approxi mately 3 1 , 8 00 MVA.  TheUtility’s distribution ne
twork interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations, where equipment reduces the high-voltage transmissio 
n voltages to lower voltages, r anging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers. 
These distribution substations s
erve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network.  Emanating from each substation are primary and secondarydistribution lines connec
ted to local transforme rs and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users.  In some cases, the Utilitysells electricity from its distrib
ution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity.  In 2016 the Utility commenced op erations in anew electric distribu
tion control center facilit y in Concord, California ; along with the existing dist ribution control centers in Rocklin and Fresno, California, t hese control centers form a key 
part of the Utility’s effort s to create a smarter, more resilient grid. 
In 201 
6 , the Utility continued to deploy its Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration circuit technology which involves the rapid operation of s mart s witches to reduce the 
duration of customer outag es.   Another 8 9 circuits were outfitted with this equipment, bringing the total deployment to 7 89 of the Utility’s3,200 
distribution circuits.   The Utility pl ans to continue performing work to improve the reliability and safety of its electricity distribution operations in 2017 .

Utility
Operations

  
The Utility provides
 natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential custome rs) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,industrial, large commercial, an
d natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.   Core customerscan purchase natural gas 
procurement service (i.e. ,
 natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party ga s procurement service providers (referred toas core transport agents
).   When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility c ontinues to provide gas delive ry, metering and billingservices to customers. 
    When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combined service as “bundled” natural gasservice. 
  Currently, more th an 90% o f core customers, representing n early 78 % of the annual core market deman d, receive bundled natural gas service from theUtility.
 
The Utility does not provide procu
rement service to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers.  The Utility offe rs backbonegas transmission, gas delive
ry (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-core customers.   Access to theUtility's backbone gas transm
ission system is available for all n atural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.   The Utility also delivers gas to off-system customers ( 
i.e ., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.

 Natural
Gas
Supplies  
The Utility can receiv
e natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and thesouthwestern United States.  The Util
ity can also receive natural gas from fields in California.  The Utility pu rchases natural gas to serve its core customers directlyfrom producers and marke
ters in both Canada and the United States.  The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gas purchasecont 
racts have fluctuat ed generally based on market conditions.  During 201 6 , the Utility purchased appr oximately 307,100 MMcf o f natural gas (net of th e sale ofexcess supply of gas).  Substantial
ly all of this natural gas was purch ased under contracts with a term of one year or less.  The Utility’s largest individual supplierrepresented approximately 
14% of the total natural g as volume the Utility purchased during 201 6 . 
Natural
Gas
System
Assets
 
The 
Utility owns and operates an integrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California.  AtDecember 31, 201 
6 , the Utility’s natural gas system consisted of approximately 42, 800 miles of dis tribution pipelines, over 6, 7 00 miles of backbone and localtransmission pipelines, and v
arious storage facilities.  The Utility owns and operates eigh t natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system andone small station on its lo
cal transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines.  The Utility’s backbone trans mission system, composedprimarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is us
ed to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines , other local distribut ion companies, andCalifornia gas fields to 
the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems. 
The Utility has firm tr
ansportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA Gas Transmission, 
  Ltd. and TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines   Ltd., B.C. System.  These companies’ pipeline systems connect at the border to the pipeline systemowned by Gas Transmission Northwest, LLC, which provides natu
ral gas trans portation services to a po int of interconnection with the Utility’s natural gastransportation system on th
e Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon.  The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline, LLC to transportnatural 
gas from the U.S . Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin, O regon, at the California border.  Simil
arly, the Utility has firm transportation agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Co mpany, LLC and El Paso Natural Ga s Company to transport 
natural gas from supply points in the Southwestern United States to interconnection points wi th the Utility's natural gas transportation system in the area ofCalifornia near Topock, Arizon
a.  The Uti lity also has a transport ation agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company to transport gas from the U.S. RockyMountains to the interconne
ction point with the Utility’s natural gas system in the area of Daggett, California.  ( For more information r egarding the Utility’s na turalgas transportation agre
ements, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. )  
The Utility owns and operates thr
ee underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth stora ge field, all of which ar e connected to the Utility’stransmission system. 
  The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for storage andlater withdrawal. 
  In addition, f our independent storage oper ators are interconnected to the Utility's northern California transmission system. 
As of December 31, 2016 the Utility had 
installed 268 automatic and remote control shut-off valves on its gas transmission system, as specified in the eleventh of twelve safety recomm
endations made by the NTSB following its investigation of the San Bruno accident.   The NTSB closed that recommendation in 2015.   The finalsafety recommendat
ion, considered open and acceptable by the NTSB, involves en suring that all high consequen ce pipeline mileage in the Utility’s gas transmissionsystem has been hydrostatic
ally tested.   As of December 31, 2016, the Utility has hydrostatically tested about 840 miles and completed the majority of this safetyrecommend 
ation.   The Utility currently plans to complete the NTSB recommendation by 2022 for the remaining approximately 28 aggregate pipeline miles(involving hundreds of primar
ily short pipeline segments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter of f-takes from the larger transmis sion pipelines). 
In addition, in 2016, the Utility 
inspected 260 miles of transmission pipeline using in-line inspection tools and upgraded an additional 107 miles of transmissionpipeline to allow for the us
e in-line inspe ction tools, replaced 127 m iles of distribution main, and completed the installation of over 25,000 line makers to more easilyidentify the locations o
f gas pipelines.

Competition

Competition in the Electricit
y Industry 
California law allows
 qualifying non-residential electric customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather than from the utilities up to certai
n annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility.   T his arrangement is known as “direct access.”     In addition,California law permits cities
, counties, and certain other public agencies th at have qualified to become a CCA to generate and/or purcha se electricity for their localresidents and businesses. 
  By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents and businesses which do not affirmatively elect to c ontinue to receive electricity from a utility.
 
The Utility continues to provid
e transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers, although these customers can choose to obtainmetering and billing se
rvices from their energy service provider. The CCA customers continue to obtain t ransmission, distribution, metering, and billing services fromthe Utility.  In addition to 
collecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to co llect charges intended to recover the genera
tion-related costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of direct access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. The Utilityremains the electricity provider 
of last r esort for these customers.  
In some circumstances, gov
ernmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute to provide retailelectric servic
e, may seek to acquire the Ut ility’s distribution f acilities, general ly through eminent domain.   These same entities may, and sometimes do, constructduplicate distribution facilities
 to serve existing or new Utility customers. 
20
 

 The Utility is also impac
ted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy st orage.  The levels of self -generation of electricity by customers(primarily solar installations) a
nd the use of customer net energy metering, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits at the full retail rate, areincreasing. 
  These fa ctors result in a shift o f cost responsibility for grid and related services to other customers of the Utility.  The Utility also competes for theopportunity to develop and constru
ct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnec ted to, its service te rritory through a competitive biddingprocess managed by the CAISO.
 
Competition in the Natural Gas Industry
 
The Utility competes with oth
er natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern Cali fornia market on the bas is oftransportation rates, 
access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services.  The Utility also competes forstorage services with othe
r third-party storage providers , primarily in northern Ca lifornia.
Environmental
Regulation

The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and healthof the Utility's personn 
el and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and radioactivesubstances; the discharge o
f pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the re porting and reduction of CO ­ 2 and other GHG emissions; the transportation, handling,storage and disposal of spent nuc
lear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. 

 The penalties for violationof these laws and requirem
ents can be severe and may include sign ificant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions.  These laws and requirements also mayrequire the Utility, unde
r certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)  Generally, the U tility recovers most of the costs of complying with environmenta
l laws and regulations in the Utility's rates, subject to reasonableness review.  Environmental costs associ ated with the clean-up of mostsites that contain haz
ardous substances are subject t o a ratemaking mechan ism described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .  
Hazardous Waste Compliance and Remediation
 
The Utility's facilit
ies are subject to various regulations adopted by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, including the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct and the Comprehensive Environm
ental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended.  The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted byother 
federal agenc ies respo nsible for implementing federal environment al laws.  The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted bythe State of California 
and various state and local agencies.  These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous subs tance on the (1)owner or operator of the sit
e where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in somecases, their corporat
e successors.  Under t he Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act , these persons (known as “potentiallyresponsible parties”) 
may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the har m caused to natural resources, and paying for the 
costs of health studies. 
The Utility has a comprehens
ive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  Under federal and Californ ia laws, the Utilitymay be respons 
ible for remediat ion of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site.  The Utility’s remediation activities are overseenby the California Departm
ent of Toxic Substances Control, several California regional water quality con trol boards, and various other federal, state, and localagencies.  The Utility
 has incurred significant environmental remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gasgathering sites, sites wher
e natural gas compressor stations ar e located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardoussubstances.  Groundwater at the Uti
lity’s Hinkley and Topock natural gas compressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility ’s past operatingpractices.  The Utility 
is responsible for remediating this groundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment. 
For more information about 
environmental remediation liabi lities, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

 Air Quality and Climate Change
 
The Utility's electri
city generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air p ollution control laws, includ ing thefederal Clean Air Act, as wel
l as state and local statutes.  These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone, CO 
2 , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), mono-nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter, and other GHG emissions. 
In December 2009, the EPA concluded tha
t GHG emissions contribute to climate change and issued a finding that GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollutionthat endangers public hea
lth and wel fare.   In May 2014, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (a conf ederation of the research arms of thirteen federaldepartments and agencies) 
released its third Nat ional Climate Assessment, which stated that the global climate is changing and that impact s related to climate change are already evident 
in many sectors and are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond. 
Federal
Regulation
.  At the federal level, the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Cle an Air Act.  Although there have been severallegislative atte
mpts to address climate change through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yetbeen enacted.  In the abse 
nce of federal legis lative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions. 
In August 2015, the EPA published final regula
tions under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act to control CO 2 emissions from new fo ssil fuel-fired power pl ants. While these regulat
ions do not affect the Utility’s existing power plants, the regulations impose emission limitations on fossil fuel-fired power plants constructed afterJanuary 8, 2014 and will affect 
the design, constructi on, operation and cost of such power pl ants.  
In August 2015 
, the EPA also published final regulations under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to control CO 2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired powerplants 
.  These regulations are des igned to red uce power plant CO 2 em issions on a national basis by as much as 32 % by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.  Stateswere required to 
submit final plans to comp ly with the se regulations by September 2016, but were permitted to request an extension to fi le such plans until September 2018. It is uncertain whether 
and how these federal regulations will ultimately impact California, since existing state regulation currently requires, among other things,the gradual reduction of s
tate-wide GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 20 3 0.   Following publication of the EPA’s regulations , in October 2015 West Virginia and several othe
r states and parties challenged the EPA’s section 111(d) regulations in the Unit ed States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and petitioned the Court 
to stay the regulations pending review of the appeal on the merits.  The D.C. Circuit denied the request for stay but in February 2016, theUnited States Supreme Court grant
ed a stay of the section 111(d) regulations pending re view of the appeal by the D.C. Circuit.  Th e Supreme Court’s decision mayaffect the nature, extent and
 timing of implementat ion of these regulations.  As described below, the Utility exp ects all costs and revenues associated with the state-wide, comprehen 
sive cap-and-trade prog ram to be passed through to customers. 
With the change in 
federal a dministration from Pres ident Barack Obama to President Donald Trump, there is significant uncertainty with regard to what furtheractions may occur 
regarding climate change at the federa l level.  The new a dministration has indic ated that it intends to revoke the Clean Power Plan regulations andpossibly withdraw from interna
tional efforts to combat climate change.  Upon taking office, President Trump issued an executi ve order to freeze a ll regulations issuedin the 60 days preceding his inaugu
ration and directed the EPA and the White House to remove climate change- related materials and web pages, pend ing furtherreview.  
It is assumed that the new a dministration also w ill take action to suspend all climate related regulatory and funding activities.  In light of the potential policyreversal at the fed
eral level, the State of California has indicated that it intends to continue and enhance its leadership on climate chang e nationally and globally.  
22
 

 State
Regulation.

California ’s AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, p rovides for the gradual reduction of s tate-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by2020.  The CARB has approved various regulations 
to achieve the 2020 target , including GHG emissions reporting and a s tate-wide, comprehensive cap-and-tradeprogram that sets gradua
lly declining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of the economy.  The cap 
- and-trade program’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electricity generation and large industrial sectors.  Thenext compliance period, whi
ch began on January 1, 2015, expanded to include the natural ga s and transportation secto rs, effectively covering all the economy’s majorsectors until 2020.  The Utility
’s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of natural gas deliveredto the Utilit 
y’s customers other than na tural gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own compliance obligation. During each year of the progr
am, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowed fo r that year. Emitters can obtain a
llowances from the CARB at quarterly auctions or from third parties or exchanges.  Emitters may also satisfy a portion of their complianceobligation through the purchas
e of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties (such as landowners, livestock owners, and farmers) thatoccur outside of the emi
tters’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as refo restation or biomass proj ects.  Addit ionally, Senate Bill 32 (2016) requires that 
CARB ensure a 40% reduction in greenhouse g ases b y 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  CARB is currently considering regula tory amendments to thecap-and-trade progra
m to extend the program’s authority to 2030.   The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to b e passed through to customers.  
The California RPS program that r equires the utilities to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help r
educe GHG emissions in California.
Climate
Change
Mitigation
and
Adaptation
Stra
tegies.
During 201 6 , the Utility continued its programs to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the Utility’soperations (including custo
m er energy usage) on the envi ronment and to plan for the actions that it will need to take to adapt to the likely impacts of climate changeon the Utility’s future ope
rations , including forming an offi cer-level coordinating committee to govern and oversee t he Utility’s activities .  The Utility regularly reviews the most relevant
 scientific literature on climate change such as sea level rise, temperature changes, rainfall and runoff patterns, and wildfire risk, to help theUtility identify and eva
luate climat e change-related r isks and develop the necessary adaptation strategies.  The Utility maintains e mergency response plans andprocedures to address a rang
e of near-term risks, including extreme storms, heat waves and wildfires and uses its risk-assessment pr ocess to prioritize in frastructureinvestments for longer-
term risks associated with climate change. The Utility also engages with l eaders from business, government, academia, and non-profitorganizations to share in
formation and plan for the future. 
Wit 
h respect to electric operations, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demand dueto more extreme, pers
istent, and frequent hot weather.  The Utility believes its str ategie s to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficien cy and demand responseprograms, infrastructu
re improvements, and the use of rene wable energy and energy storag e are effective strategies for a dapting to the expected ch anges in demand for electricity.  
The Utility is making substantial investments to build a more modern and resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather and relatedemergencies. 
  The Utility’s vegetation management activities also reduce the risk of wildfire impacts on electric an d gas facilities.  Over th e long-term, the Utilityalso faces the risk of high
er flooding and inundation potential at coastal and lo w elevation facilities due to sea level rise combined with high tides, storm runoff andstorm surges.
 
Notwithstanding the c 
urrent high snowpack, c limate scientists predict that climate c hange will result in varying temperatures and le vels of precipitation in theUtility’s service territory 
.  This could, in turn, affect the Utility’s hydroelectric generation.  To plan for this potential change, the Uti lity is engaging with state andlocal stakeholders and 
is also adopting strategies such as maintaining higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases,and 
collaborating on research and new modeling tools.   
With respect to natur
al gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane into theatmosphere.  The Utility has 
taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implemen ting techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reduce thepressure and volume of natur
al gas within pipelines prior to venting.   In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in m ethane emissions by implem enting improvements in leak detectio
n and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipeline materials. 
23
 

 Emissions Data
 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility tr
ack and report their annual environmental perf ormance results across a broad spectrum of areas.  The Utility reports its GHGemissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a vo
luntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The ClimateRegistry, a non-pro 
fit organization.  The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 201 5 totaled more than 54 million metric tonnes of CO 
­ 2 equivalent , two-thirds of which came fro m customer natural gas use.  The following t able shows the 201 5 GHG emissions data the Utilityreported to the CARB under 
AB 32 .   PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publish additional GHG emissions data in their annual Corporate Responsibility andSustainability Report.

Since the Utility purchases a portion of its electricity  from the wholesale market, the Utility is not able to track some of its delivered electricity back to a specific generator.  Therefore, there issome unavoidable uncertainty in the Utility’s emiss
ions rate. 
Air Emissions Data for Utility-Owned 
Generation  
In addition to GHG emissions data provid
ed above, the table below sets forth information about the air emissions from the Utility’s owned generation facilities.  TheUtility’s owned ge

Water Quality
 
On May 19, 2014, 
the EPA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures atelectric power plants, su
ch as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse en vironmental impacts. Various industry and environment
al groups have challenged the federal regulations in proceedings pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. California’s once-through 
cooling policy d iscussed below is considered to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations.  Therefore, California’simplementation proc
ess for the state policy will likely continue without any significant change. 
24
 

 At the state level, in 2010 
, the California Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or othersignificant measures to red
uce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.  The policy also provided for analternative compliance approach f
or nuclear plants if certain criteria were met.  As required by the policy , the California Water Board appointed a committee toevaluate the feasibility and c
ost of using alternat ive technologies to achi eve compliance at Diablo Canyon.  The committee’s consultant submitted its final report tothe California Wate
r Board in September 2014 .  The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframe s to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such as cooling towers.  
The Utility’s Diablo Canyon operat ions must be in compliance with the California Water Board’s policy by December 31, 2024 .  
On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered in
to a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration o f its current operating licenses in 2024 and2025 
, and replace it with a GHG-free portfolio of energy efficiency, renewables and energy storage.  As a result of the planned re tirement, the California Water Boardwill no lon 
ger need to address alte rnative compliance measures for Diablo Canyon.  Beginning in 2017, as required under the p olicy, the Utility will pay an annualinterim mitigation fee until operati
ons cease in 2024 and 2025 .   
Additionally, t 
he Utility expects tha t its decision to reti re Diablo Canyon will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility, the Cent ral CoastWater Board and the Califo
rnia Attorney General’s Office regarding the therma l component of the plant’s once-through cooling discharge.  (For more infor mation,see “Diablo Canyon Power Plant” in Ite
m 3. Legal Proceedings below.) 
Nuclear Fuel Disposal
 
Under the Nuclear Waste Poli
cy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contrac ts under whichthe DOE would be required to dispose of the u
tilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by the utilities’customers.  The DOE has been unable to m
eet its con tractual obligation wi th the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nuclear generating units atDiablo Canyon and the retired nuc
lear facility at Humboldt Bay.  As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store its spent fuel onsit e atDiablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE ful
fills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel.  The Utility and other nuclear power plantowners sued the DOE to recover the costs 
that they incurred to construct interim storage  facilities for spent nuclear fuel. 
In September 2012, the 
U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Utility executed  a settlement agreement that awarded the Utility $266 million for spent fuel storage costs incurred th
rough December 31, 2010.  The settlement agre ement also provided a claims process by which the Utility submits annual requests forreimbursement of its ongo
ing spent fuel storage costs.   Through 2016, the Ut ility has been awarded an add itional $99 million through these annual submissions , including 
$28 million for costs incur red between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015.   The claim for the period June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016 is currently underreview by the DOE. 
  These proceeds are being refunded to customers through rates.   The settlement agreemen t, as amended, does not address cos ts incurred forspent fuel storage beyond 2016; an 
extension of the agreement for costs through 2019 is pending DOJ approval. Costs beyond 2016 could be subject to futurelitigation. 
  Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when and whether the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear powerplant owners to dispose of spent fue

RISK
FACTORS

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
financial results can be affected by ma ny factors, including esti mates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policiesdescribed in MD&A
, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results.  The follow ing discussion of key risk factors shou
ld be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&Aand the consolidated finan
cial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial S tatements and Supplement ary Data” of this Form 10-K.  Any of thesefactors, in whole or in part, 
could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.

PG&E Corporation 
’s and the Utility ’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could b e materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability that the 
Utility incurs in connection with the Butte fire.  
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.   On April 28, 2016, Cal Firereleased its report o
f the investigation o f the origin and cause of th e wildfire.   According to Cal Fire’s report, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in two fatalities,destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and fou
r commercial properties, and damaged 44 structures.   Cal Fire’s report concluded that the wildfire was caus ed when aGray Pine tree contacted 
the Utility’s electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility and/or its vegetation managementcontractors, ACRT 
Inc. and Trees, Inc., to identif y certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure of the tree.   In apress release also issued on Apr
il 28, 2016, Cal Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million f rom the Utility.  
On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs 
filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of Californiafor Sacramento County. 
  Subrogation insurers also filed a separate maste r complaint on the same d ate.   The California Judicial Council had previously authorizedthe coordination of all 
cases in Sacramento County.   As of December 31, 2016, complaints have been filed against the Utility and its two vegetation managementcontract 
ors in the Superior Court of Califo rnia in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador involving approximately 1,950 individualplaintiffs represen
ting approximately 950 households and their insurance companies.   These complaints are p art of or are in the pro cess of being added to the twomaster complaints. 
  Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on inverse condemnation and negligence theories of liability.   The numberof individual complaints 
and plaintif fs may increase in the future.   
In connection with this mat
ter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through the theory ofinverse condemnation.  In add
ition, the Utility may b e liable for fire supp ression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to havebeen negligent. 
  The Utility believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss of at least $750 million for all pote ntial damages describ ed above. The Utility has liability insurance 
from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Butte fire in an aggregate amount of approximately $900million.  Such insurance cove
rage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient to cover the Utility’s u ltimate liability.  
The process for estimatin
g costs associated with claims relating to the Butte fire requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number ofassumptions and subjective f
actors.   As more information becomes known, includ ing additional discovery f rom the plaintiffs and results from the ongoing mediationand settlement process, 
management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Butte fire may change.   A change in management’s estimates orassumptions 
could result in an adjustm ent that could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition and the results of operationsduring the period such change oc
curred.   
If the Utility records 
losses in connection with claims re lating to the Butte fire t hat materially exceed the amount the Utility accrued for these liabilities, PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in the reporting periods durin g which additional charges are recorded, d
epending on whether the Utility is able to record or collect insurance recoveries in amounts sufficient to offset such additional accruals. (For more information, see 
“Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A and in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidat ed Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
26
 

 PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial results 
may be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC’s investigative enforcement proceedingsagainst the 
Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing sta te and federal investigation s and requests for information.  The Utility also couldincur material costs and fines in connection with future inv
estigations, citations, audits, or enforcement a ctions.  
The Utility could incur ma
terial charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with a potential settlement or litigated  outcome of the CPUC’s investigation of the Util
ity’s compliance with the CPUC’s rules re garding ex parte communi cations .  While on October 14, 2016, the Cities o f San Bruno and SanCarlos, ORA, the SED, TURN, and the Utility submitted a status 
report to the CPUC which proposed an update to the framework for resolving the proceeding andincluded a total of 164 com 
munications in the scope of the proceeding, the Utility expects that the other parties may argue that the number of violations exceeds the164 communications refe
renced in the status report either because a single communication may have violated more than one rule or because they be lieve some of thematerial provided dur
ing discovery constitutes impermissible ex parte communications.  The Utility expects to contest many of these assertions.  If the matter does notsettle, the CPUC will determine whi
ch commu nications included within th e scope of the proceeding were in violation of its rules.  The CPUC will also determinewhether to impose penalti
es or other remedies, as a result of a potential settlement or otherwise.  The CPUC can impose fines up to $50,000 for each violation, and up to $50,000 per day if the CPUC determines th
at the violation was continuing.  The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on thetotality of the cir
cumstances, including such factors as how many days e ach violation continued; the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by theviolations and the number of p
ersons affected; and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation.  TheCPUC 
is also required to conside r the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.  The CPUC has historically exercised broaddiscretion in determ
ining whether violations are continuing and the amount of penalties to be impos ed.  While it is uncert ain how the CPUC will calculate the numberof violations or the penal
ty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity andresults of operations. 
(See the discussion under the he ading “Regulatory Matters” in MD&A.) 
The Utility also is a targ
et of a number of investigations and government requests for information.  In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Franc isco and theCalifornia Attorne 
y General's office opened inv estigations into matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel.   Inaddition, in October 2016, the Util
ity received a grand jury subpoena and letter from the U.S. Attorney for the No rthern District of Cali fornia advising that the Utilityis a target of a fede
ral investigation regarding possible criminal violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and conspiracy to violate the act.  The Utility was alsocontacted by certain o
ther federa l agencies with request s for information.  While the Utility believes that these requests for information are routine, their outcome isuncertain.  The Utility a
lso is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges wil l be brought against the Util ity. 
If these investigations o
r requests for information result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties or suffer negativeconsequences described above 
in the immediatel y preceding risk factor.  In addition, a negative outcome in any of these investigations or future enforcement actionsmay negatively affe
ct the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Util ity’s request to recover costs that the parties 
allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations.   
The Utility may incur fin
es and penalties in connection with the Utility’s efforts to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline r ights of way and the Penalty Decision.  The Penalty De
cision requires the SED to review the Utility’s gas transmission operations (including the Utility’s compliance with the remediesordered by the Penalty Decision
) and to perform annual audits of the Uti lity’s record-keeping p ractices for a minimum of ten years.  The SED could impose fines onthe Utility or require 
the Utility to incur unrecoverable costs, or both, based on the outcome of these future audits.  In addition, although PG&E Corporation and th e Utility do not currently f
ace the possibility of fines or penalties in the first phase of the CPUC’s pending investigation into the Utility’s safety culture since it has beencategorized as rate 
setting, it is uncerta in how a next phase , if any, would be categorized.  (See the discussion under the heading “Regulatory Matters” in MD&A.) 
The Utility could be subject 
to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws,regulations or orders tha
t could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacyrequirements; customer billing;
 customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; de sign, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety andinspection practices
; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; andenvironmental compli
ance.  CPUC sta ff could impose penaltie s on the Utility in the futur e in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citationprograms.  The amount of such fin
es, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and th e Utility’s financia l results.   
27
 

 PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial results 
could be materially affected by the conviction of the Utility in the federal criminal proceeding andby the debarment proceeding 
.  
On August 9, 2016, the jury 
in the federal criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco,found the Utility guilty on one coun
t of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity manageme nt regulations of theNatural Gas Pipeline Safety Act.  On Janu
ary 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility.  The court sentenced the Utility to a five- year corporate probation per
iod, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five yea rs, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years , a fine of $3 million to be paid to t
he federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service. The Utility has dec ided not to appeal the convi ctions. 
The probation includes a requ
irement that the Utility not commit any local, state or federal crimes during the probation period.  As part of the probation, the Utility isrequired to retain a 
third-party monitor.  The goal of the monitorship will b e to prevent the criminal conduct with respect to gas pipeline transmission safety that gaverise to the conviction.  To th
at end, the goal of the monitor will be to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriat e steps to maintain the s afety of thegas transmission pipeline sys
tem, performs appropriate integrity management assessments on its gas transmission pipelines, and maintains an effective ethics andcompliance program and safet
y related incentive program. 
After an initial assess
ment is conducted and an initial report is prepared by the monitor, the monitor will prepare reports on a semi -annual basis setting for th themonitor’s continued assessm
ent and making recommendations consistent with the goals and sc ope of the monitorship.  The Util ity expects that the monitor will beretained before the 
end of the second quarter of 2017. 
At December 31, 2016, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include d a $3 million accrual in connection wi th this matter.  The Util itycould incur material costs 
and additional penalties , not recoverable through r ates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connectionwith the monitorship (includ
ing but not limited to the monitor’ s compensation or costs resul ting from recommendations of the monitor). 
Also, in September 2015, the Utility was no
tified that the DOI had initiated an inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or debarred from entering intofederal procurement 
and non-procurement contr acts and programs citing the San Bruno explosion and indicating, as the basis for the inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping, poor identifica
tion and evaluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB’s investigation.  On December 21, 2016, the Utility and the DOIentered into an interim admini
strative agreement that reflects the DOI’s determination that the Utility remains eligible to contract with federal government agencieswhile the DOI determines whethe
r any further a ction is necessary to prot ect the federal government’s business interests.  The agreement will be effective untilsuperseded by an amended agre
ement or determination.  The agreement also provides that the DOI is still conducting a review to determine whether the Utility has an effective compli
ance and ethics program and that the DOI is required to use its best efforts to complete its review before the end of 2017.  If the DOI determines thatthe Utility’s program is no
t generally effective in preventing and de tecting criminal conduct, the Utility may be required to enter into an amended administrativeagreement and imple
ment remedial and other measures, such as a requirement that the Utility’s natural gas operations and/or compliance and eth ics programs be supe rvised by one or more 
independent third party mon itor (s) . 
The Utility’s conviction and 
the outcome of the debarment proceeding could harm the Utility’s relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, businesspartners, or other consti
tuencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management.   Further, they could negatively affect the outcomeof future ratemaking 
and regulatory proceedings, for example by, enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allow ed to recover costs that the partiesallege are somehow rel
ated to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty.  They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny withrespect to various aspec
ts of how the Utility’s busi ness is conducted or organized.    As discussed under the heading “Regulatory Matters”   in Item 7. MD&A, theSED continues evaluating PG&E Corporation’s 
and   the Utility’s   organizational culture and governance in the CPUC’s pending investigation to examine th eUtility’s safety culture.
 
28
 

 PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results pri
marily depend on the outcomes of  regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility’s ability tomanage its operating expenses and capital expendi
tures so that it i s able to earn its authorized rate of return in a tim ely manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Ut
ility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficientrevenues to recover 
r easonable costs of providing service, in cluding a return on its capital investments.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results couldbe materially af
fected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safe ly and reliably serve i ts customers and earn its authorizedROE.  The outcome of the Utility’s r
atemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the Utility’s reputation (especially as a result of the Utili ty’sconviction 
in the federal cri minal trial ), the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in thepolitical, regulato
ry, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility’s regulators, consumer and othe r stakeholder organiza tions, and customers, about theUtility’s ability to pro
vide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. 
The Utility also is requir
ed to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives , such as those relating to th e development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging
 infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiencyprograms, energy storage and 
renewable en ergy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the Ca lifornia high-speed rail project.  The Utility’s abilityto recover costs, including 
its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the final fo rm oflegislative or regulatory req
uirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for theUtility’s electricity and natural
 gas services.  
In addition 
to the amount of authoriz ed revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs tosafely and reliably serve it
s customers differ from authorized or forecast costs.  The Utility may in cur additional costs for many reasons including changing marketcircumstances, unanti
cipated events (such as storms, fires, accidents, catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), or compliance with new state lawsor policies.  Althoug 
h the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs thecosts and when the Utility is autho
rized to collect revenues to recover such costs.  Alternatively, the CPU C or the FERC may disallow costs that they de termine werenot reasonably or prudently in
curred by the Utility.
The Utility’s ability to 
recover its costs also may be affected by the economy and its impact on the Utility’s customers.  For example, a sust ained downturn or sluggishness in the economy could r
educe the Utility’s sales to industrial and commercial customers or the level of uncollectible bills could increase.  Although theUtility generally re
covers its costs through rates, regardless of sales volume, rate pressures in crease when the costs are borne by a smaller sales base.  
Changes in commodity prices a
lso may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE.   Although theUtility generally re
covers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodityprices could create overall rate 
pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to rec over its costs that are no t categorized as “pass-through” costs.   To relievesome of this upward rate pressu
re, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.  
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s finan 
cial results depend upon the Utility’s cont inuing ability to recover “pass-through” costs, including electricity andnatural gas procurement costs, from customers  in a ti
mely manner.  The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons.  In a ddition, the Utility’s ability to r
ecover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth , if the CPUC fails to adjust theUtility’s rates to refl
ect such events. 
The Utility meets custom
er demand for elect ricity from a variety of so urces, including electricity generated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricityprovided by third parties unde
r power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.   The Utility must mana ge these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory p
rinciples of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approvedlong-term procuremen
t plan.  The CPUC could disallow procurement cost s incurred by the Utility i f the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with theseprinciples or if the Uti
lity did not comply with its procurement plan.  
29
 

 Further, the contractua
l prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future powe r purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety ofreasons, including developmen
ts in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customerdemand due to a 
dverse economic conditions o r the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers.   In particular, the Utility will incur additional costs toprocure renewable energy 
to meet the higher targets established by California SB 350 that became effecti ve on January 1, 2016.  Despite the CPUC’s current approval of the contrac
ts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the costs are unreasonably above market.  
The Utility’s ability to 
recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues tofunction effectively.  Alt
hough market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related system s and software on which the market mechan
isms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.   The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passingthrough the higher costs of el
ectricity to customers.  For example, during the 2 000 and 2001 energy crisis, the ma rket mechanism flaws in California’s then-newlyestablished wholesale electricit
y market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimatelycaus 
ing the Utility to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Util
ity’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through municipalization of 
the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumerswho become direct access 
customers of alternative generation providers.  (See “Co mpetition in the Elec tricity Industry” in Item 1.)  As the number of bundledcustomers (i.e., those custo
mers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as theUtility would 
have a smaller custom er base from which to recover certain procurement costs.  Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges forabove market 
generation-relat ed costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be suf ficient for the Util ity to fully recover these costs.  Inaddition, the Utility’s ab
ility to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups.  Furthermore, if the formercustomers return to re
ceiving e lectricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recoverthrough rates or that it 
may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing l
evels of self-generation of e lectricity by customers (primarily  solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering (“NEM”),which allows self-generat
ing customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining cu stomers.   In January2016, the CPUC adopted new NEM rules and rates. 
  The new rules and rates became effective for new NEM customers of the Utility in December 2016.   New NEMcustomers will be requir
ed to pay an interconnection fee, will go on time of use rates, and will be requir ed to pay some non-bypassable charges to help fund some ofthe costs of low income, energy 
efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.   However, the resulting rules will still put upward rate pressure on remainingcust 
omers, and remove the cap on the number of NEM customers.   Significantly higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of suchcustomers as they may seek 
alternative energy providers.  The CPUC states that it intends to revisit these rules in 2019.  
A confluence of technology-r
elated cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage aviable, cost-effective alternative to
 the Utility’s bundled electric se rvice which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission, anddistribution investments.  
If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of capital i nvestment would likely decline as well, 
in turn leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings.  Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due tocustomer migration to o
ther energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technolo gy, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation,unless substantially offse
t through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results. 
The CPUC has begun to impl 
ement rate reform to allow resi dential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of providing service and decreasecost-subsidization among cus
tomer classes.  Many aspects of rate reform are not yet finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose a fixedcharge on certain custo
mers.  If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates toreflect the impa
ct of changing loads , the wide deployment of distr ibuted generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storagetechnologies, PG&E Corporation’s and th
e Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results wil
l be affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt andequity financings.
 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility will 
continue to seek funds in the capital and c redit markets to enable the Utility to make capital investments, pay fines that may beimposed in the future, as wel
l as costs related to rights-of-way and legal and regulatory costs.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital and credit markets and th
e costs and terms of available financing depend primarily on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings and outlook.  Their creditratings and outlook can be af
fected by many factors, including the pe nding CPUC investigations and ratemaking p roceedings.  If PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’scredit ratings were downgrad
ed to below investment grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing op
tions, including reduced, or lack of, access to the commercial paper market, additional collateral posting requirements, which inturn could affect liqu
idity and lead to an increased financing need.  Other factors can affect the ava ilability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changesin the federal or sta
te regulatory environment affecting energy companies generally or PG&E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energyin 
dustry, volatility in electricity or natural gas prices, an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, and general economic and financial market conditions. 
The reputations of PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility continue to suffer from the negat ive publicity about mat ters discussed under “Enforcement and LitigationMatters” in Item 7. MD&A.  The neg
ative publicity and the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters may undermine confidence in management’s ability toexecute its business stra
t egy and restore a construc tive regulatory environment, which could adversely impact PG&E Corporation’s stock price.  Further, the marketprice of PG&E Corporation common sto
ck could decline materially depending on the outcome of thes e matters.   The amount and timing of future shar e issuances alsocould affect the stock p
rice.  
If the Utility were unabl
e to access the capital markets, it could be required to decrease or suspend dividends to PG&E Corporation and PG&E Corporation could berequired to contrib 
ute capital to the Uti lity to enable the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.  To maintain PG&E Corporation’s dividend level in thesecircumstances, PG&E Corporation would b
e further required to access the capital or credit markets.  PG&E Corporatio n may need to decrease or d iscontinue itscommon stock dividend if it 
is unable to access the capital or credit markets on reasonable terms.   
PG&E Corporation’s ability to meet its d
ebt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the Utility’s earnings and cash flows.
 
PG& 
E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own.  The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, includingits obligation to serve cus
tomers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and meet its obligations to employees andcreditors, before it 
can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation.  Under the CPUC’s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility’s dividend policy must beestablished by the Uti 
lity's Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors give “firstpriority” to the Utili
ty’s capital requirements, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility’s obliga tion to serve or to operat e the Utility in a prudentand efficient manne
r.  The CPUC has interpreted this “first priority” obligation to include the requirement that PG&E Corporation “infuse the Utility with all types ofcapital necessary fo
r the Utility t o fulfill its obligat ion to serve.”  In addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&E Corporation, the Utilitymust maintain its autho
rized capital structure with an average 52% equity component.  
If the Utility were requ
ired to pay a material amount o f fines or incur material unrecoverable costs in connection with the terms of the probation or monitorship , the pending CPUC investigations, or other enfor
cement matters, it would require incremental equity contributions from PG&E Corpo ration to restore its capital structure.  PG&E Corporation common s
tock issuances used to fund such equity contributions could materially dilute EPS.   (See “Liquidity and Financial Resources”in Item 7. MD&A.)  Further, if PG&E Corporat
ion were required t o infuse the Utility with signi ficant capital or if the Utility was unable to distribute cash to PG&ECorporation, or both, PG&E Corporation may be un
able to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend, or meet other obligations.
 
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
ability to pay dividends also could be affected by financial covenants contained in their respective credit agreements that requireeach company to mainta
in a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidate d capitalization of at most 65%.

ity Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. Business.)  The Util ity’s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its abilityto efficiently maintain, operate,
 and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably.  The Utility undertakes substantial capitalinvestment proje 
cts to construct, replace,  and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricitygeneration facilities at the end
 of their useful operating lives.  The Utility’s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, co nstruct and decommission its facilities issubject to numerous risks, many o
f which are beyond the Utility’s control, including those that arise from:  
●
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or di stribution lines, or natur al gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can causeexplosions, fires, or other c
atastrophic events; 
●
an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow cor rect operatingprocedures, or welding or fabr
ication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets anduncontained natural gas f
low; 
●
failure to maintain adequate capaci ty to meet customer de mand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gasoutages, gas surges back into homes, s
erious personal injury or loss of life; 
●
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results  in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other thirdparties;
 
●
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environm ental damage, or reputationa
l damage; 
●
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act; 
●
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that prot ect land on which the Utility’s assets are built; 
●
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, orreasonably should have 
identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion), andthe failure to respond effecti
vely to a catastrophic event; 
●
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respo nd effectively to a catastrop hic event that can lead to public or employee harm orextended outages;
 
●
severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, wild land and other fires, pandemics, solar events,electromagnetic events, or ot
her natural disasters; 
●
operator or other human error; 
●
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently; 
●
construction performed by third part ies that damage the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or “dig-ins” that damage the Uti
lity’s underground pipelines; 
●
 
 
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the 
Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and 
32
 

 ●
attacks by third parties, including cy ber-attacks, acts of terrorism,  vandalism, or war. 
The occurrence of any of th
ese events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output;damage the Utility’s ass
ets or ope rations; damage the ass ets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others;and cause personal injury or d
eath.  As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair as sets and restore servic e, and to compensatethird parties. 
 
In particular, the Uti
lity may incur material liability in connection with the Butte fire.  ( See “PG&E Corporation and the Utility may incur material liability inconnection with Butte Fire” 
above. )   Additionally, on January 12, 2017, a residential structure fire occurred in Yuba City, California resulting in the collapse of thehouse and injuries to two persons insid
e the house.  The CPUC, a third-party engineering firm, and local fire and police officials are investigating the origin and causeof the incident.  The Utili
ty may incur material costs, including as a result of these investigations or any proceedings that could be commenced in connection with thisincident. 
 
Further, although the Utility o
ften enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the constructionor demolition or facilities, t
he Utility may retain liability for the quali ty and completion of the con tractor’s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcementaction if the contra
ctor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury o
r death caused by third-party contractor actions.  
Insurance, equipment 
warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or aga
inst all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financ
ial results.  Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favo rable as the Utility’s current insurance coverage or maynot be available at all.
 
Further, California law inc
ludes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California for wildfire damages. Inverse condemna tion imposes strict liability (including 
liability for attorneys’ fees) for damages and takings as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including itselectric transm
ission lines.  As a result of the strict liability s tandard applied to wildfi res, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increase ofwildfires including as a r
esult of the ongoing drought, and the Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the futu re at comparable cost and te
rms as the Utility’s current insurance coverage, or at all.  In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover inrates the increased 
costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses. 
I 
f the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financ
ial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be m aterially affected.  
The Utility’s operational and information t
echnology systems could fail to function properly or be improperly accessed or damaged by third parties (includingcyber-attacks and physical acts 
) or damaged by severe weather, natural disast ers, or other events. Any of these events could disrupt the Utility’s operations andcause the Utility to incur unanticipated loss
es and expense or liability to third parties .  
The operation of the 
Utility’s extensive electricity and natural gas systems re lies on evolving and increas ingly complex operational and information technologysystems and network infrastru
ctures that are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties.   All of the Utility’s operational andtechnolog 
y systems and network infrastru cture are vulnerable to disability or failures in the event o f cyber-attacks and physical acts.  Cyber- attacks are increasingly sophisticated and may inc
lude computer hacking, viruses, malware, social engineering, denial of s ervice attacks, ranso mware, destructive malware, or other means ofdisruption, destruction, or unau
thorized access, acquisition or control.  In addition, hardware, software, or applications the Utility develops or procures from thirdparties may contain de 
fects in design or manufa cture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security.  Physical attacks may include actsof sabotage, acts of war, ac
ts of terrorism, or other physical acts.  The Utility’s operational and information tec hnology systems and networks are dee med criticalinfrastructure, and any 
failure or decrease in their functionality could, among other things, cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations,negatively impact th
e Utility’s ability to generate, transport, d eliver and store energy and gas, or otherwise operate in the most efficient manner or at all, underminethe Utility’s perform
ance of critical business functions, damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties, and lead to reputationa l harm.  As a result,such events could subject the Ut
ility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, investigations, and regulatory actions thatcould result in fines and pen
alties, and los s of customers, any of which could hav e a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition andresults of operations.
 
33
 

 The Utility’s systems, includ
ing its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billin g systems, require ongoing main tenance, modification,and updating, which can be costly and 
increase the risk of errors and malfunction.   The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, andupdate its systems and these 
third-part y vendors could cease to exist , fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility’s systems and information, orexperience internal or external 
security incidents.   Any incidents, disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, d elays or deficiencies in the modification of exist
ing systems or implementation of new systems could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, or diversion ofmanagement’s and employ
ees’ attention and resources, or negatively a ffect the Utility’s ability to  maintain effective financial controls or timely file requiredregulatory reports. 
  The Utility also could be subject to patent infringement claims arising from the use of third-party technology by the Utility or by a third-pa rty vendor. 
 
In addition, the Utility’s 
information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees.   A data breach involving theft,improper disclosure, or oth
er unauthorized access to or acquisition of conf idential informat ion could subject the Utility to penalties for violation of applicable privacylaws, claims by third part
ies, and enforcement actions by government agencies.  It could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the Utility’ s reputation.
 
The Utility and its third pa
rty vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility’s informationtechnology systems, or confiden
tial data, or to disrupt the Utility’s op erations.  None of these att empts or breaches has individually or in the aggregate resulted in asecurity incident with a 
material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition and results of operations.  Despite implementation of secu rity and control measures, the
re can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent the unauthorized access to its systems, infrastructure, or data, or the disruptionof its operations, eithe
r of which could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s a nd the Utility’s financi al condition and results of operations.  
While the Utility ma
intains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continueto be available at r 
ates the Utility beli eves are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance orrecoverable in rates.
 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utilit
y’s nuclear power plants expose it to pot entially significant liabi lities and the Utility may not be able to fullyrecover its costs if regulator
y requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utili
ty’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant  liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risksrelating to the storage, 
handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic act ivity, natural disaster, or terroris
t act.  If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have amaterial effe
ct on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial result s.  In addition, the Utility m ay be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million ofliabilities aris
ing out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United State s.  (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolida
ted Financial Statements in Item 8.)     
On August 11, 2016, the Utility submitted an app
lication to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 andreplace it with a port
folio of energy efficiency and GHG-free resources.  The application includes a joint prop osal between the Utility and certain interested parties,entered into on June 20, 2016.  However, the Uti
lity continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel.  Some of these nuclearopposition g 
roups regularly file pe titions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws orpolicies in opposition to nucl
ear power.  Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory pr oceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costlyto complete.  It is also poss
ible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation.  As a result,operations at the Utili
ty’s tw o nuclear generation uni ts at Diablo Canyon could cease before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025.  In such an instance, the Utilitycould be required to reco
rd a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effe ct on PG&E Corporation andthe Utility’s financi
al results. 
34
 

 In addition, in order to re
tain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costsin connecti 
on with (i) an employee re tention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program,  
to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and el sewhere in the company.   The Utility currently estimatesthat the additional cos
t of the employee retention program and the employee retraining and development program will be approximately $350 million.   The JointProposal seeks confirmation 
from the CPUC that these costs will be r ecovered through the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning electric rates.   The employee retentionand retraining and develop
ment programs are subject to bargaining with the Utility’s labor unions.   The Utility will also incur costs in connection with an employee severance program. 
  The severance program was previously approved by the CPUC in prior nuclear decommissioning ratemaking proceedings. 
The Utility has incurred, and 
may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.   (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.Business.) 
  If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.   The Utility maydetermine that it cannot 
comply with the new regulations o r orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC mayorder the Utility to ce
ase operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.   The Ut ility may incur a material charge if  it ceasesoperations at Diablo Canyon befor
e the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025.  At December 31, 2016, the Utility’s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7billion.
 
At the state level, the Ca
lifornia Wate r Board has adopted a policy on once -through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or othersignificant measures to red
uce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.   If t he California Water Boardrequires the install
ation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at DiabloCanyon and may incur a mater
ial charge.   If the Utility obt ains contingent approvals r eferred to herein that will result in retiring Diablo Canyon at the end of thecurrent NRC operating licenses, 
the Utility will not be required to install cooling towers or implement alternative measures in order to comply with t he California State Water Board Once-Through Cool
ing Wat er Policy, thus eliminat ing the regulatory uncertain ty regarding the measures that could have been imposed on theUtility or of incurring a 
material charge related thereto.  Even if the Utility is ult imately not required to install cooling towers, under the State Water Board’s interimmitigation measures 
applicable to Diablo Canyon’s operations prior to 2025, starting in 2016, it will be required to make payments to the California CoastalConservancy t 
o fund various environmental mitigation projects, that the Utility does not expect to exceed $5 million per year.  
On June 28, 2016 the California State Lands Com
mission approved an extension of the Utility’s leases of coastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge structures for the nucl
ear generation units at Diablo Canyon, to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon’s current operating licenses.  The Utility will be required toobtain an additional le
ase extension from the State Lands Commission to cover the period of tim e necessary to decommission the facility.  The State LandsCommission and California Coasta
l Commission will evaluate appropriate environmental mitigation and development conditions associated with thedecommissioning project, 
the c osts of which could be substantial.  
The Utility also has an obliga
tion to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at theend of their useful lives. 
  (See Note 2: Sum mary of Significant Account ing Policies – Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatement in Item 8.) 
  The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear d ecommissioning charges that are collect
ed from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.   If the Utility’s actualdecommissioning costs, includ
ing the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exc eed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialresults could be mater
ially affected. 
Risks
Related
to
Environmental
Factors
 
The Utility’s operations are subject 
to extensive environmental laws and changes i n or liabilities under these laws could adverse ly affect PG&E Corporation’sand the Utility’s financial results.
 
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of haza
rdous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife.  The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and othercosts associated with compl
iance with these environmental statute s, rules, and regulations.  The Uti lity has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to payfor environmental re
mediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws.  Alth ough the Utility has recorded liabilities for 
known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination,remediation alternatives, the ap
plicable remediation levels, and the financial a bility of other pote ntially responsible par ties.  (For more information, s ee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8.) 
Environmental remediation co
sts could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the curren t trend toward more string ent standards, and stricter and moreexpansive application of 
existing environmental regulations.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses orpermits issued by environmen
t al or regulatory agenc ies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or othersanctions. 
 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to r
ecover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking me chanisms.  One of thesemechanisms allows the Util
ity rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review.  TheCPUC may discontinue or change these ra
temaking m echanisms in the future o r the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC hasauthorized the Utility 
to recover in rates. 
Some of the Utility’s environ
mental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance 
.  (See “Environmental Regula tion” in Item 1.)  The Utility’s costs to rem ediate groundwater contamination n ear the Hinkley natural gas compressor siteand to abate the effe
cts of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  Theirfinancial results 
also can be materially affected b y changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
35
 


  
The Utility’s future operations may be a
ffected by climate change that may have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condit ion,results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
The Utility has been
 studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the Utility ’s operations and is developing con
tingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant.  Scientists project that climatechange will increase e
lectricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weath er.  While snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains has been at higher thannormal levels this winte
r, California has experienced ongoing drought in the past. If temperatures and the levels  of precipitation in the Utility’s service territorycontinue to ch 
ange, that could impact the levels of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. As a result, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation could change and theUtility would need to consider m
anaging or acquiring additional generation.   
If the Utility increases i 
ts reliance on conventio nal generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may becomemore costly for the Util
ity to comply with GHG emissions limits.  In addition, increasing temperatures and lower level s of precipitation could  increase the occurrenceof wildfires in the 
Utility’s service territory causing damage to the Utility’s facilities or the facilities of third parties on which the Utility relies to provide service,damage to third parti
es for loss of property, personal injury, o r loss of life.  In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility’s facilities,including hydroelectri
c assets such as dams and canals, and the electric transmission and distribution assets.  The Uti lity could incur substanti al costs to repair orreplace facilities, restore service, c
ompensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries.  The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would berecovered through rates, bu
t as rate press ures increase, the lik elihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase.  
Events or conditions caused by cl
imate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lowerrevenues or in 
creased expenses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be mat erially affected.  
Other
Risk
Factors
 
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could b
e materially affected as a result of political and legislative developments. 
The Utility’s financial res
ults could be materially affected as a result of the recent change in federal a dministration from Pres ident Barack Obama to Preside nt Donald Trump.  For example, the new adm
inistration has indicated tax refo rm as a priority.  Tax reform outli nes produced by both President Trum p and the Tax Reform Task Force 
include proposals related  to federal tax rate s , deductions for state income taxes ( and potentially property tax), interest expense deduction, capitalexpenditure deduction, and 
expensing plant.  It is uncle ar what tax reform may be ultimately adopted.  It is generally expected that a tax reform bill will be introducedin early 2017. 
  
The Utility may be required to incur substantia
l costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Uti lity’s business and the Utility maybe subject to fines and penalties for fa
ilure to comply or obtain license renewal. 
The Utility must comply with th
e terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the con tinued operationof the Utility’s hydroele
ctric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies.  Many of the Utility’scapital investment proj 
ects, and some maintenan ce activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authoriz
ations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays.   Further, existing permits and licenses could be revokedor modified by the agenci
es that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued.  In addition, the Utility oftenseeks periodic renewal of 
a lic ense or permit, such as a wast e discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility.  If a license orpermit is not renewed f
or a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Uti lity could incur an impa irment charge or othercosts.  Before renewing a perm
it or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility’s compliance costs.  In particular, inconnection with a license 
renewal for one or more of the Utility’s hyd roelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions thatcould, among other things, requi
re increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility.  In addition, local governmen ts mayattempt to assert ju
risdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain.   
The Utility may incur pena
lties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with nec essary governmental permits, authorizat
ions, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timelymanner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Uti
lity’s financial results coul d be materially affected.  
Poor investment performance or other fac
tors could require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan,other postretirement benefits p
lans, and nuclear decommissioning trust s.  
PG& 
E Corporation and the Utility prov ide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees.  The Utility alsomaintains three trus
ts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities.  The performance of the d ebt and equity markets affects the value ofplan assets and trust assets.  A de
cline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts.  The cost of providing pension and other postretirement bene 
fits is also affect ed by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on planassets, employee demograph
ics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, fu ture government regulation, andprior contributions to the p
lans.  Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes inthe laws or regulations reg
ar ding nuclear decommission ing or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related todecommissioning dates, te
chnology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment.  (See Note 2: Summary of Signific ant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.) If the Utility is requi red to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or ifactual nuclear deco
mmissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additionalcosts in rates, PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected .  
36

 
 The Utility’s success depends on the availab
ili ty of the services of a qualif ied workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreementswhich cover a substantial number of employees.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Uti
lity’s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attrac t and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disrupt
ions occur. 
The Utility’s workforce is ag
ing and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years.  Although the Utility has underta ken efforts to recruit and train new f
ield service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel.  The majority of the Utility’s employeesare covered by collec
tive bargaining agreements with three unions.  Labo r disruptions could occur depend ing on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms ofthese agreements with th
e unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members.  In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utilityemployee 
s could join one of these unions in th e future.  
PG&E Corporatio
n and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore thereputational harm generated b
y the negative publi city stemming from th e ongoing enforcement proceedings.  Any such occurrences could negatively impact PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition and results of operations.

On April 9, 2015, the CPUC issued a decision in its invest
igative enforc ement proceedings agains t the Utility to impose total penalties of $1.6 billion on the Utilityafter determining 
that the Utility had committed numerous violations of laws and regulations related to its natural gas tra nsmission operations that could have l ed to or contributed to the natu
ral gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010.  In January 2016, the CPUC closed the investigative proceed
ings.  The total penalty include d (1) a $300 million fine, (2) a one-time $400 million bill credi t to the Utility’s natural gas customers, (3) $850million to fund pipeline s
afety projects and programs, and (4) remedial measures that the CPUC estimates will cost the Utility at least $50 million. 
The Utility refunded the $400 m 
illion to its customers in the second quarter of 2016 and paid the $300 million fine in the third quarter of 2015.  On December 1, 2016, the CPUC 
approved a final phase two decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case, which applies $689 million of the $8 50 million pe nalty to capital expenditures.  The Utility is 
precluded from including these capital costs in rate base.  The final phase two decision also approves the Uti lity’s list of programs andprojects that meet 
the CPUC’s definition of “safety related ,” the costs of which are to be funded through the $850 million penalty.   For more information, see“Enforcement and Litig
ation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fin ancial Statements in Item 8. 
Federal
Criminal
Trial
 
On June 14, 
2016, a federal crimin al trial against the Utility began in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, on 12felony counts alleging tha
t the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Sa fety Act relating to record-keeping, pipeline integr
ity management, and identification of pipeline threats, and one felony count cha rging that the Utility obstructed the NTSB investigation in tothe cause of the San Bruno ac 
cident.  On July 26, 2016, the court grant ed the government’s motion to dismiss one count alleging that the Util ity knowingly andwillfully failed to retain a 
strength test pressure record with respect to a distribution feeder main, thereby reducing the to tal number of counts from 13 to 12. 
38
 

 On August 9, 2016, the jury returned its verd
ict.  The jury acquitted the Utility on all six of the record-keeping allegations but found the Utility guilty on six felonycounts that include one count o
f obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity management regulations of the Natural GasPipeline Safety Act. 
 
On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgm
ent of conviction sentencing the Utility to a five-ye ar corporate probation p eriod, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with 
the ability to apply for early termination after three years , a fine of $3 million to be p aid to the federal government, certain advertisingrequirements, an 
d community service.  The Utility has decided not to appeal the convictions.  The probation includes a requ irement that the Utility not commit anylocal, state, or fede
ral crimes during the probation period.  As part of the probation, the Utility is requir ed to retain a third-p arty monitor.  The goal of the monitorshipwill be to prevent the cr
iminal conduct with respect to gas pipeline transmission safety that gave rise to the conviction.  To that end, the goal of the monitor will be tohelp ensure that th 
e Utility takes reasonab le and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of the gas transmission pipeline system, performs appropriate integritymanagement assessments on 
its gas transmission pipelines, and maintains an effective ethics an d compliance progr am and safety related incentive program.  
After an initial assess
ment is conducted and an initial report is prepared by the monitor, the monitor will prepare reports on a semi -annual basis setting for th themonitor’s continued assessm
ent and making recomme ndations consistent with the goa ls and scope of the monitorship.  The Utility expects that the monitor will beretained before the 
end of the second quarter of 2017.  For more information, see “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in

Butte
Fire
Litigation  
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.  On April 28, 2016, Cal Firereleased its report o
f the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire.  According to Cal Fire’s report, the f ire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in two fatalities,destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and fou
r commercial properties, and damaged 44 structures.  Cal Fire’s report concluded that the wildfire was caused when aGray Pine tree 
contacted the Utility’s electric li ne which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility and/or its vegetation managementcontractors, ACRT 
Inc. and Trees, Inc., to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation m anagement program ult imately led to the failure of the tree.  In apress release also issued on Apr
il 28, 2016, Cal Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million from the Utility. 
On May 23, 2016, individual 
plaintiffs filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of Californiafor Sacramento County.  Subrogation insu
rers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.  The California Judicial Council had previously authorized thecoordination of all cas
es in Sacramento County.  As of December 31, 2016, complaints have been filed against the Utility and its two vegetation managementcontractors in the Superio
r Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sa cramento, and Amador involving approximately 1,950 individualplaintiffs represen
ting approximately 950 households and their insurance companies.  These complaints are part of or are in the process of being added to the two master complaints.  Pla
intiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on inverse condemnation and negligence theories of liability.  The number ofindividual complaints and p
laintiffs may increase in the future.  
The Utility 
continues mediating and se ttli ng cases.  The next case managemen t conference is scheduled for March 2, 2017. 
In connection with this mat
ter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through the theory of inverse condemnation.  In add
ition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to havebeen negligent.  The Utility b
elieves it was not negligent; howeve r, there can be no assuranc e that a court or jury would agree with the Utility.  The Utility believesthat it is probable tha
t it will incur a loss of at least $750 million for all potential damages described above.  This amount is based on assumptions abo ut the number, size, and type of structur
es damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, as well as assumptions aboutpersonal injury damages, a
ttorneys’ fees, fire suppression costs, and other damages that the Utili ty could be liable for under the theories of inverse condemnationand/or negligence

 Diablo
Canyon
Nuclear
 Power
Plant 
The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant e
mploys a “once-through” cooling water system that is regulated under a Clean Water Act permit issued by the Central CoastBoard.  
Thi s permit allows the Diablo Canyon power plant to discharge the cooling water at a temperature no more than 22 degrees above the temperature of theambient receiving wat
er, and requires that the beneficial uses of the water be protected.     The beneficial use s of water in this region inc lude industrial water supply,marine and wildlife hab
itat, shellfish harvesting, and preservation of rare and endangered species.     In January   2000, the Central Coast Board issued a proposeddraft cease and desist o
rder alleging that, although the tempe rature limit has never been exceeded, the Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant's discharge was notprotective of beneficial uses.
 
In October 
  2000, the Utility and the Central Coast Board reached a tentative settlement under which the Central Coast Board agreed to find that the Utility'sdischarge of cooling water 
from the Diablo Canyon power plant protects beneficial uses and that the intake technology reflects the best technology available, asdefined in the federa
l Clean Water Ac t.     As part of the tentative settlement, the Utility agreed to take measures to preserve certain acreage north of the plant and tofund approximately $6 
  million in environmental projects and future environmental monitoring related to coastal resources.     On March   21, 2003, the Central CoastBoard voted to accept
 the settlement agreement.     On June   17, 2003, the settlement agreement was executed by the Utility, the Central Coast Board and theCalifornia Attorney Genera
l's Office.     A condition to the effectiven ess of the settlement agreement was that the Central Coast Board renew Diablo Canyon's permit. 
However, 
a t its July   10, 2003 meeting, the Central Coast Board did not renew the permit and continued the permit renewal hearing indefinitely.     Several CentralCoast Board members indicat
ed that they no longer supported the settlement agreement, and the Central Coast Board requested a team of independent scientists todevelop additional infor
mation on possible mitigation measures for Central Coast Board staff.     I n   2005, the Central Coast Board reviewed the scientists' draft report recommending several 
such mitigation measures, but no action was taken .   
Subsequently, the California Sta
te Water Resources Control Board adopted a Once-Through Cooling Water Policy in May 2010 which requires Diablo Canyon to bein compliance 
with the policy by December 2024 and allows for al ternative compliance measures at nuc lear power plants.   
On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered in
to a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and2025 and replace it with a GHG-fre
e portfolio of energy efficienc y, renewables and energy storag e.   The Utility expects that the State Board’s OTC Policy and its decision to retire Diab
lo Canyon will a ffect the te rms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility, the Cent ral Coast Water Board and the California At torney General’s Office 
.   Also, as required under the State Boa rd’s OTC Policy, beginning in 2017 , the Utility will pay an annua l interim mitigation fee until operationscease at the end of the 
current licenses.   
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that the ultimate outcome of t his matter will not have a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition or results ofoperations. 
    
Venting
Incidents
in
San
Benito
County
 
As part of its regular
 maintenance and inspection practices for its natural gas transmission system, the Ut ility performs in-line inspections of pipelines using devicescalled “pigs” that t
ravel through the pipeline to inspect and clean the walls of the pipe.   When in-line inspections are performed, natural gas in the pipeline mu st be released or vented at 
the pipeline station where the device is removed.   In February 2014, the Utility conducted an in-line inspection of a natural gas transmissionpipeline that trave
rses San Benito County and vented the natural gas at the Utility’s transmission station loc ated in Hollister, which is next to an elementary school.  The Utility vented the natu
ral gas during school hours on three occasions that month.   After being informed of the venting by the local air district, the San BenitoCounty 
district attorney not ified the Utility in December 2014 that it was contemplating bringing a civil legal action against the Utility for violation of Health andSafety Code section 41700, which prohibits d
ischarges of air contaminants that cause a public nu isance.   In January 2017, the Utility and the district attorney reached an agreement on a stipul
ated judgement that resolves the matter.   The stipulated judgment includes a fine of approximately $175,000.   In addition, a $75,000 fine willbe held in abeyan 
ce for 5 years, and would be payabl e to the San Benito County district attorney in case of non-compliance with certain remedial requirements of thestipulated judgment. 
  The stipulated judgment was executed by the court on Janua ry 27, 2017.

 Transformer
Oi
l
Release
in
Sonoma
County  
During a rain storm in February 2015, 
transformer oil was released into an underground vault in the City of Santa Rosa, in Sonoma County, while a Utility crew wasreplacing a broken trans
former.  Following further rains, the oil released from the vau lt and reached a nearby creek.  The event was investigated by Santa Rosa FireDepartment, the local 
environmental enforcement authority, and later referred to the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office.  In May 2016, the District At torney informed the Utility th
at it would seek penalties and costs in excess of $100,000 for alleged violations of several sections of the California Health and Safety andCalifornia Government codes whi
ch prohibit unauthorized spills or releases of oil in to waters of the state a nd require that releases be reported to the Office ofEmergency Services.  
In November 2016, the Utility and th e Sonoma County district attorney reached an agreement on a stipulated judgment that resolves the matter. The stipulated 
judgment includes a fine o f $80,000, reimbursement of enforcement costs of $40,000, and injunctive provisions requiring improvements to the Utility’svault dewatering procedur
e and training.  In November 2016, the court approved the stipulated judgment.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND


 RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
 
PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose pri
mary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and centralCalifornia.  The Utility gen
erates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. 
The Utility’s 
base revenue requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case a nd by the FERC in its TO rate cases based on forecast costs.    Differences between for
ecast costs and actual costs can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of marke t forces on thecost of labor and mater
ials.     Dif ferences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.     Generally, differencesbetween 
actual costs and forec ast costs affect the Utility’s ability to  earn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility R evenues and Costs that Impact ed Earnings” inResults of Operations below). 
    However, for certain operating costs, such as costs associated with pension and other employee benefits, the Utility is authorized totrack the difference between act
ual amounts an d forecast amounts and re cover or refund the difference through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs thatdid not Impact Earnings” in Resu
lts of Operations below).     The Utility also collects revenue requirements to recover certain costs that t he CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers 
, such as the costs to procure e lectricity or natural gas for its customers .     Therefore, although these costs can fluctuate, they generallydo not impact net income 
(referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Ea rnings” in Results of Operations below).       See “RatemakingMechanisms” in Item 1 fo
r further discussion. 
This is a combined report of PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statement s for each of these two enti ties.  Thiscombined MD&A should be read in conjunc
tion with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8.

Net
Income
and

per
Share 
T 
he following table is a summary reconciliation of the key changes, after-tax, in PG&E Corporation’s income available for common shareholders and EPS (as well as earnings from o 
perations and EPS based on earnings fro m operations) for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 (see “Results of Operations” below). 
  “ Earnings from operations ” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as inc ome available for co mmon shareholders lessitems impacting comparability. 
  “ Items impacting comparability ” represent items that managem ent does not consider part of the normal course of operations and affect comparability of financial res
ults between perio ds.   PG&E Corporation uses earnings from operations to understand and compare operating results acrossreporting periods for var
ious purposes including internal b udgeting and forecasting, shor t and long-term operating p lans, and employee incentive compensa tion .  PG&E Corporation believes that e
arnings from operations provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business allowing for a better comparisonagainst historical r
esults and expectations for future performance .  E arnings from operations are not a substitute or a lternative for GAAP measures such as income av ailable for common sha
reholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

million) associated with safety-related cost disallowances imposed by the CPUC in its April 9, 2015 decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigations. 
  The Utility also recorded $57 million (before the tax impact of $23 million) for disallowances imposed by the CPUC in i ts final phase two decision of the 2015 GT&S ratecase for prohibited 
ex
parte
 communications.  In addition, the Utility accrued fines of $26 million in connect ion with the final decision app roved by the CPUC on August 18, 2016 in its investigation regarding natural gas distribution record-keeping practices and $3 mill
ion in connection with the maximum statutory fine imposed on January 26, 2017 in the federal criminal trial against the Utility 
.   These fines are not tax deductible .   Future fines or penalties may be imposed in connection with other enforcement, regulatory , and litigation activities regardingnatural gas matters and regulatory communications 
.  
( 
7 ) T he Utility incurred costs of $ 113 million (before the tax impact of $ 46 million) , during the year ended December 31, 2016 for pipeline related expenses incurred in connection with the multi-year effort to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights of way 
.  
(8 
) T he Utility incurred costs of $72 million (before the tax impact of $ 29 million), during t he year ended December 31, 2016 for legal and regulatory related expenses incurred in connection with various enforcement, regulatory, and litigation activities regar 
ding natural gas matters and regulatory communications.   
(9 
) T he Utility incurred charges of $ 219 million ( before the tax impact of $89 million ), during the year ended December 31, 2016, for disallowed capital expenditures based on the CPUC final phase o 
ne decision dated June 23, 2016 in the 2015 GT&S rate case, including $134 million ( before the tax impact of $54 million ) for the disallowed portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital expenditures in excess of adopted 
amounts and $85 million ( before the tax impact of $35 million) for t he Utility’s estimate of 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that are likely to exceed 
authorized amounts.   (S ee “Regulatory Matters ” below for more information.)  
(10 
) As a result of the timing of the CPUC’s final phase two decision in the 2015 GT&S rate case, the Utility recorded $325 million (before the tax impact of $132 million) in excess of the 2016 authorized revenue requirement during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 
.  
Key
Factors
Affecting
Financial
Results  
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel
ieve that their future results of operations, fin ancial condition, and cash flows will be materiall y affected by the following factors: 
 

 ●
The
Outcome
of
Enforcement,
Litigation,
and
Regulatory
Matters.

The Utility’s future fin ancial results may continue to be impacted by the outcome ofcurrent and future enforcement
, litigation, and regulatory matters, including the Butte fire litigation, p otential costs associa ted with the allegedviolations of the CPUC’s ex parte com
munication rules, the cost of complying with the terms of probation and monitorship imposed in the sentencingphase of the federal criminal trial
 and related remedial and other measures, and potential p enalties in connection with the Utility’s self-report related toits customer service 
representatives' drug and alcohol testing program.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)  
 ●
The
Timing
and
Ou
tcome
of
Ratemaking
Proceedings.

 The Utility’s results may be impacted by the timing and ou tcome of its 2017 GRC, FERC TO rate case, and petition for
 modification related to its cost of capital .  Based on the current schedule, the Utility expe cts a fina l decision in its 2017 GRC in the first half of 
2017. (See “Regulatory Matters − 2017 General Rate Case” below for more information.)   In addition, settlement negotiations are ongoing related to 
the Utility’s FERC TO rat e case requesting a 20 17 retail electric transmission revenue requirement.  (See “Regulatory Matters − FERC Transmission Owner Rate Cases 
” below for more informa tion.)  Also, on February 7, 2017, the Utility fil ed with the CPUC a petition formodification 
related to its cost of capital.  (See “Regulatory Matters – CPUC Cost of Capital ” below for more informa tion.) The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affe
cted by many factors, including arguments made by intervening parties,  potential rate impacts, t he Utility’s reputation, theregulatory and political 
environments, and other fa ctors. 
 
 49
 

   
●  The
Ability
of
the
Utility
to
Control
and
Recover
Operating
Costs
and
Capital
Expenditures.

 The Utility is committed t o delivering safe, reliable,sustainable 
, and affordable electric and gas services to its custom ers.  Increasing demands from state laws and policies relating to increased renewableenergy resources, the redu
ction of GHG emissions, the expansion of energy efficiency programs, the development and wides pread deployment of distributed generation 
and self-generation resources, and the development of energy storage technologies have increased pressure on the Utility toachieve efficien
cies in its operations in order to maintain the affordability of its serv ice.  In any given year the Utili ty’s ability to earn its authorizedrate of return depends on i
ts ability to manage costs within the amounts authorized in rate case decisions.   The Utility forecasts that in 201 7 it willincur unrecovered pipeline-relat 
ed expenses ranging from $80 million to $125 million which primari ly relate to costs to identify and removeencroachments from t
ransmission pipeline rights-of-way.  Also, the CPUC decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case establishes various cost capstha 
t will increase the risk of overspend over the rate case cycl e. (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidate d Financial Statements in Item 8 .)  
 ● 
   The
Amount
and
Timing
of
the
Utility’s
Financing
Needs.

PG&E Corporation contributes equity to the Utility as needed to maintain th e Utility’sCPUC-au 
thorized capital st ructure.  In 201 6 , PG&E Corporation issued $842 mil lion of common stock and used $835 million of the cash proc eedsto make equity contribut
ions to the Utility.  PG&E Corporation forecasts that i t will continue issuing a mater ial amount of equity in future years,including $400 million to $600 mi
llion in 2017, primarily to support the Utility’s cap ital expenditures.  PG&E Corporation may issue additional equityto fund 
unrecoverable pipeline-relat ed expenses and to pay fines and pen alties that may be required by the final outcomes of pending enforcementmatter 
s.  These additional issuances c ould have a material d ilutive i mpact on PG&E Corporation’s EPS.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability 
to access the capital markets a nd the terms and rates of future financings could be affected by the outcome of the matters discussed in “Enforcement and Litig
ation Matters” in Note 13   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 ,   change s in their respective credit ratings, general econom
ic and market conditions, and other factors. 
 For more information about 
the factors and risks that could affect PG& E Corporation’s and the Utility ’s future results of opera tions, financial condition, and cashflows, or that could cause futu
re results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors .  In addition, this 201 6 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that ar
e necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions that are based on currentestimates, expecta
tions, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management's knowledg e of facts as of the date of this 2016 Form 10-K 
.  See the section entitl ed “Forward - Looking Statements” below for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially.  PG&E Corporation and the 
Utility are not able to p redict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation to update forward-lookingstatements, whether in r
esponse to new information, future events, or otherwise.50

The table below shows certain i
tems from the Utility’s Consolidated State ments of Income for 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 .  The table separately identifies the revenues and costs that impacted e
arnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (such ascosts to purchase elect
ricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose p rograms) and the correspond ing amount of revenues collected to recover thosepass-through costs, do not impact 
earnings.  In addition, expenses that have been specifically authorized (such as the payment of pension costs) and the correspondingrevenues the 
Utility is authorized to collect to recover such costs, do not impact earnings. 
Revenues 
that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assetsand to prov 
ide the Utility an opportuni ty to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that i mpact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incurs toown and operate its assets.

Utility
Revenues
and
Costs
that
Impacted
Earnings
 
The following discussion presents th
e Utility’s operating results for 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , focusing on revenues and expenses th at impacted earnings for theseperiods.
 
Operating
Revenues
 
The Utility’s electr
ic and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $ 1.2 b illion or 13% in 2016 compared to 2015 , primarily as a result of approximately 
$ 700 million of incr emental revenues authorized in the 2015 GT&S rate case and approximately $ 425 million of additional base revenues as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC deci 
sion and by the FERC in the TO rate case.   
The Utility included the au
thorized increase for the 2015 GT&S rate case period in rates starting August 1, 2016.   The Utility will collect, over a 36-month period, thedifference between adop
ted revenue requirements and amounts previously collected in rat es, retroactive to Janu ary 1, 2015.  Accounting rules allow the Utility torecognize revenues in a g
iven year only if they will be collected from customers within 24 months of the end of that year.  As a result, the Utility will recognize theremaining $ 
102 million in the first quarter of 2017.   (See “Regulatory Matters” below.)   
T 
he Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $393 million or 4 % in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result ofapproximately $490 mill
ion of additional base revenues as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and by the FERC in the TO rate case.  This increase was partially offset by th
e absence of approximately $110 million of revenues the CPUC authorized the Utility to  collect for recovery of certain PSEP-related costsduring the same period in 2014.
 
52
 

 Operating
and
Maintenance
 
The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings in creased $ 385 m illi on or 7% in 2016 compared to 2015 , primarily due to $ 85 7 millionin charges 
for third-party cla ims, Utility clean-up, repair, and legal costs r elated to the Butte fire , $ 219 million in permanently disallowed capital spending (see“Regulatory Matters” be
low), $34 million in charges recorded in connection with the final CPUC decision related to the natural gas distribution faciliti es record- keeping 
investigation, the federal criminal trial , and the atmospheric cor rosion inspection self-report, $24 million in higher pipeline-related expenses and legal andregulatory related expenses 
during the year ended Decemb er 31, 2016 , an escalation related to la bor, benefits, and service contracts, and accelerat ed transm ission and distribution project work 
.  These increases were par tially offset by $ 500 million in charges associated with the Penalty Decision for customer refunds and fines incurred in 2015 with no corresponding 
charges in 2016 and approximately $125 mil lion in lower disallowed capital charges associated with the Penalty Decision in2016 
.  Additionally, the Utility r ecorded approximately $ 6 25 million in probable insurance re coveries related to the Butte fire in the year ended December 31, 2016as compared to $49 million o
f insurance recoveries for third-party claims related to the San Bruno accident for the same period in 2015.  (S ee Note 13 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated F inancial Statements in Item 8.)  
The Utility’s operating and 
maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $1.2 billion or 27% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to $907 million incharges associated with th
e Penalty Decision, consisting of $400 million for the custom er bill credit, an additional $100 million charge for the fine payable to the state,and $407 million of disallowed c
apital charges.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The increase is also due 
to higher labor and benefit-related expenses of approximately $100 million and fewer insurance recoveries for third-party claims andassociated legal costs o
f $63 million related to the San Bruno accident.  No further insurance recov eries related to these claims are expected.  These increases wereoffset by $116 million in disa
llowed capital recorded in 2014 related to the PSEP.   
Depreciation,
Amortization,
and
Decommissioning
 
The Utility’s deprecia
tion, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased $ 143 million or 5% in 2016 compared to 2015 and $ 179 million or 7% in 201 5compared to 
2014 .  In 201 6 , the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions.  In 2015, the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions 
and higher depreciation rates as authorized by the FERC in the TO rate case .  
Interest
Expense
 
The Utility’s 
interest expenses increased by $ 56 million or 7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to theissuance of additional 
long-term debt.  The Utility’s interest expenses increased by $ 43 million or 6% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the sameperiod in 2014, primarily due 
to the issuance of long-term debt.

Income
Tax
Provision
 
The Utility’s income tax p
rovision increased $ 89 million , or 468% , in 2016 as compared to 2015 .  The increase in the tax provision was prima rily the result of the statutory tax effect 
of higher pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015 , partially offset by higher tax benefits from property-related timing differences in 2016compared to 2015 
.  The higher effective tax rate is driven by higher pre-tax earnings in 2016, partially offset by rate impact from p roperty-related timing differences.  
The Utility’s income tax p
rovision   decreased $403   million, or   105%,   in   2015   as compared to   2014.   This is primarily the result of the statutory tax effect of  lower 
pre-tax income and hi gher tax benefits from p roperty- re lated timing differences in 2015 as compared to 2014.   The lower effective tax rate in 2015 is theresult of lower pre-tax ear
nings in 2015 and rate impact from property-related timing differences.

level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC and 2015 GT&S rate cas e decisions authorized revenue requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these temporary tax
differences, PG&E 
Corporation and the Utility recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabi lities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s andthe Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and r 
everse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probablethat these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates.

Electricity

The 
Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third p arties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its owngeneration facili
ties, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade progr am, and realized gains and losses on price risk manag

Expenses
 
The Utility’s operating exp
enses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred such as pension contr ibutionsand public purpose programs costs.  
If the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.  For 201 6 , 201 5, and 201 
4 , no material amounts were incurred above author ized amounts.  
LIQUIDITY
AND
FINANCIAL
RES
OURCES
Overview
 
The Utility’s ability to 
fund operations , finance capital exp enditures, and make distributions to PG&E Corpora tion depends on the levels of its operating cash flowsand access to the capit
al and credit markets.  The CPUC authoriz es the Utility’s capita l structure, the aggregate amount of long-term and short-term debt that theUtility may issue 
, and the revenue require ments the Utility is able to collect to recover its cost of capital.  The Utility generally utilizes equity contributions fromPG&E Corporation and long-term senio
r unsecured debt issuances to maintain its CPUC-authorized long-term capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred sto 
ck.  (See “Ratemaking Mechan isms” in Item 1 . )   The Utility relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financingneeds. 
  
PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund ope
rations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund equity contributions to the Utility , and pay dividends primarilydepends on the level of cash dis
tributions received from the Utility and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.  PG&E Corporation has materialstand-alone cash flows rel
ated to the issuance of equity and lo ng-term debt, dividend payments, and issuances and repayments under its revolving credit f acility andcommercial paper p
rogram.  PG&E Corporation relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs. 
PG&E Corporation’s 
and the Utility’s credit rati ngs may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters.  Credit rating downgrades may increase the cost 
and availability of short-term borrowing, including commercial paper, the costs associat ed with credit facil ities, and long-term debt costs.  Inaddition, some of the
 Utility’s commodity contracts contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit ratingagencies.  If the Utili
ty’s credit ra ting were to fall belo w investment grade, the Utility would be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralizesome of its net liabil
ity positions .  (See Note s 9 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan cial Statements in Item 8.)   
PG&E Corporation’s equity contribut
ions to the Utility are funded primarily through common stock issuances.  PG&E Corporatio n forecasts that it wil l issue between$400 
million and $ 6 00 million in common stock during 2017, prima rily to fun d equity contributions to the Ut ility.  T he Utility’s equity needs will continue to be affected by 
the timing and outcome of un recoverable pipeline-related expenses and by fines , penalties and claims that may be imposed in connection with the matters descr 
ibe d in “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.  Com mon stock issuances by PG&E Corporation to fund these needs could 
have a material di lutive impact on PG&E Corporation’s EPS .

 Cash
and
Cash
Equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG&E Corporation and theUtility maintain sepa
rate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds.  In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Utility holds restrictedcash that, prior to October 2016, p
rimarily consisted of cash held in escrow pending the resolution of the remaining disputed claims that were filed in the Utility’s reorganization proce
eding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  In October 2016, the Utility rec eived approval from the bankruptcy court to release theremaining $161 million of 
cash held in escrow to unrestricted cash for use by the Ut ility.  (See “Resolution of Rem aining Chapter 11 Disputed Claims” in Note 13 ofthe Notes to the Consolidated Financ
ial Statements in Item 8.)   
Financial
Resources

Debt and Equity Financings
 
The Utility issued $ 
1.0 billion in long-term debt and $ 500 million in short-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2016.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)     
During 2016, PG&E Corporation sold 
2.6 million shares of its common stock under the Feb ruary 2015 equity distribution agreement for cash proceeds of $ 149 million, net of commiss
ions paid of $ 1.3 million.  As of December 31, 2016, the remaining gross sales available under this agreement were $ 275 million. 
In August 2016, PG&E Corporation sold 
4.9 million shares of its common stock in an underw ritten public offer ing for net cash proceeds of $ 309 million. 
In addition, 
d uring 2016, PG&E Corporation sold 7.4 million shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestm ent and S tock Purchase Plan, and share-based compensat
ion plans for total cash proceeds of $ 364 million .  
The proceeds from 
equity issuances were used for general corpo rate purposes, including the contribution of equity to the Utility .  For the year ended December 31,2016 
, PG&E Corporation made equity contr ibutions to the Utility of $ 835 million.  Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to continue to issue long-term and short-term d
ebt for genera l corporate purposes and to m aintain the CPUC-authorized capital structure during 2017.
Revolving Credit Facilities and Commer
cial Paper Programs 
In June 2016, PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
each extended the termination dates of their existing revolvi ng credit facilit ies by one year from April 27, 2020 toApril 27, 2021. At December 31, 2016, PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility had $ 300 million and $ 1.9 billion available under their respective $ 300 million and $3. 0 billion revolving credi
t facilities.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility can 
issue commercial paper up to the maximum amounts of $300 million and $ 2.5 billion, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, PG&E Corporation and the Uti
lity had an average outstanding commercial paper balance of $ 84 million and $ 837 million, and a maximumoutstanding balance of $ 
176 million and $ 1.4 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2016, t he Utility had an outstanding co mmercial paper balance of $ 1.0 b illionand 
PG&E Corporation did not have any commercial paper outstanding .  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolida ted Financial Statements in Item 8.)   
T 
he revolving credit facilities require that PG&E Corporation and the Utility m aintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of at most65% as of the end of each fis
cal quarter.  At December 31, 2016, PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut ility’s total consolidated debt to total consolidated capital ization was51% 
and 50% , respectively.  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit fac ility agreement also requires that PG&E Corporation own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% ofthe common s 
tock and at least 70% of th e voting capital stock of the Utility.   In addition, the revolving c redit facilities include usual and customary provisions regarding events of defau
lt and covenants including covenants limiting liens to those p ermitted under PG& E Corporation’s and the Utility ’s senior note indentures,mergers, 
and imposing conditions on the sale of all or substanti ally all of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s assets and other fundamental changes.   A t December31, 
2016 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility were in compl iance with all covenants und er their respective revolving credit facilities.

 Dividends

In May 2016, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corpor
ation and the Utility each adopted a new target dividend payout ratio range of 55% to 65% of earnings, with a target to reach a payou
t ratio of approximately 60% by 2019.   Each Board of Directors retains authority to change the respective common stock dividend policy anddividend payout ratio
 at any time, especially if unexpected events occur that would change its view as to the pruden t level of cash conservation.   No dividend ispayable unless and until dec
lared by the applicable Board of Directors.  
PG&E Corporation
 
For the first quarter of 2016, 
the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock d ividend of $ 0.455 per share.  In May 2016, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation decl
ared a new quarterly common stock dividen d of $ 0.49 per share.  As a result, for e ach of the second, third and fourth qua rter s of 2016, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corpora
tion declared a common stock dividend of $0.49 per share .  In 2016, total dividends were $ 1.925 per share.  For each of the quarters in

per share.   Dividends paid to common share holders by PG&E Corporation were $ 921 million in 2016, $ 856 million in 2015 , and $ 828 million in 2014 .  In December 201 
6 , the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared quarterly dividends of $ 0.49 per share, totali ng $ 248 milli on, of which approximately $ 243 
mil lion was paid on January 15, 201 7 to shareholders of record on December 30, 2016.  
Utility
 
For the first quarter of 2016, 
the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock d ividend of $ 179 million to PG&E Corporation.  For each of the second, third and fourth quarters o
f 2016, the Board of Directors of the Utility declar ed common stock dividends of $ 24 4 million to PG&E Corporation .  In 2016, total dividends paid

erred stock in each of 201 6, 2015 , and 2014.   The Ut ility’s preferred s tock is cumulativ e and any dividends in arrea rs must be paidbefore the Utility may p
ay any common stock dividends.  In December 201 6 , the Board of Directors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series ofpreferred stock, payable 
o n February 15, 201 7 , to sh ar eholders of record on January 31, 2017 .

Operating Activities
 
The Utility’s cash flows from op
erating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such asdepreciation that do not 
require the use of cash.  During 2016 , net cash provided by operating activities in creased by $ 597 million compared to 2015 .  This in crease was 
partially due to the Utility receiving an additional $170 million in tax refunds in 2016 than in 2015.  The remaining increase was primarily due to fluctuations inactivities within 
the normal course of business su ch as timing and amount of customer billings and vendor billings and payments. During 2015, net cash provided by operating activiti
es increased by $1 15 million compared to 2014.  This increase was primarily due to higher bas e revenue collections authorized in the 2014 GRCand lower purchase 
d power costs (see “Cost of Electricity” under “Results of Operations – Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” above), offset bythe payment of a $300 mill
ion fine to the State General Fund as required by the Penalty Decision. 
57
 

 Future cash flow from operat
ing activities will be affected by various factors, including: 
 •
the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, including the 2017 GRC and the TO rate case, and cost of capital proceeding ;  
 •
the timing and amounts of costs that may be incurred in connection with claims associated with But te fire and the timing and amount of related insurancerecoveries, fines or penaltie 
s that may be imposed in conne ction with the ex parte OII or costs in connection with a potential settlement, fines or penalties thatmay be imposed in connection wi
th other enforcement and litigation matters, costs associated with the terms of probation a nd monitorship imposed in the sentencing phase of t
he federal criminal trial, and potential remedia l and other measures that could be imposed on the Utility in conn ection with the DOIdebarment pr 
oceeding (see “Enforcement and Litigati on Matters” in Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Finan cial Statements in Item 8 below); 
 •
the timing and amount of costs the Utility incurs, but does not recover, associated with its natural gas system; 
 •
the timing and amount of tax payments (including the bonus depreci ation) , tax refunds, net collat eral paym ents, and interest paymen ts, as well as changes intax regulations that cou
ld be adopted by Congress as a result of the new federal administration and other proposals; and 
 •
the timing of the resolution of the Chapter 11 disputed claims and the amount of principal and interest on these claims that the Utility will be required to pay. 
 
Investing Activities
 
Net cash 
used in investing activit ies in creased by $ 315 million during 20 16 as compared to 2015 primarily due to an inc rease of approximately $440 million incapital expenditures, p
artially offset by an increase in restricted cash released from escrow by approximately $160 million.  (See “Resolution of Remaining Chapter 11Disp 
uted Claims” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  Net cash used in investing act ivities increased by $412 million during2015 as compared to 2014 primar
ily due to an increase of $340 million in capita l expenditures and an increase in net purchases of nuclea r decommissioning trustinvestments in 2015 as compar
ed to net proceeds associated with sales of nuclear decommissioning trust investments in 2014. 
Future cash flows used in investing a
ctivities are largely depen dent on the timing and amount o f capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incurapproximately $6.0 billion 
in capital expenditures in each of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. 
Financing Activities
 
During 
2016 , net cash pro vided by financing activi ties de creased by $ 274 million as compared to 2015 .  During 2015 , net cash provided by financing act ivities increased by $3 
11 million as compare d to 2014.  Cas h provided by or used in financing a ctivities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on thelevel of cash provided by or used 
in operating activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the condi tions in the capital m arkets, and thematurity date of exis
ting debt instruments.  The Utility generally utilizes long-term debt issuances and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to maintain itsCPUC-authorized capital struc
ture, and relies on short -term debt to fund tempo rary financing needs.58

See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements.  As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the futu 
re, the amount shown in the column entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utili ty’s pension and other benefitplans.
(

The contractual commitments table
 above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions .  Due to the uncertainty surround ing tax audits,PG&E Corporation and the Utility canno
t make reli able estimates of the amount s and period s of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to unrecognizedtax benefits.  Matters relatin

Butte Fire Litigation
 
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Count ies in Northern California.  On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire  released its report o
f the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire.   According to Cal Fire’s report, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resu lted in two fa talities, destroyed 
549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four comm ercial properties, and damaged 44 structures.  Cal Fire’s   report concluded that the wildfire was caused when aGray Pine tree contacted 
  the Utility’s   electric line which ignited portions of the t ree, and determined that the  failure by the Utility   and/or its vegetationmanagement contrac
tors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc.,   to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure ofthe tree. 
  In a pre ss release also issued on April 28, 2016, Ca l Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million from the Utility.59
 

  
 
On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs 
filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetat ion management contra ctors in the Superior Court of Californiafor Sacramento County. 
  Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.   The California Judicial Council had previously authorized thecoordination of all cas
es in Sacramento County.   As of December 31, 2016, complaints have been filed against the Utility and its two vegetation managementcontractors in the Superio
r Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador involving app roximately 1,950 individual plaintiffs 
representing approxima tely 950 households and their insurance comp anies.   These complaints are part of or are in the process of being added to the twomaster complaints. 
  Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other c osts, principally based on inve rse condemnation and negligence theories of liability.  The number of individual complaints 
and plaintiffs may increase in the future.  
The Utility continues medi
ating and settling cases.  The next case management conferenc e is scheduled for March 2, 2017.  
In connection with this mat
ter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through the theory ofinverse condemnation.  In add
ition, the Utility may be liable for fire supp ression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to havebeen negligent.  The Utility b
elieves it was not negligent; however, there can be no assurance that a court or jury would agree with the Util ity.  The Utility believesthat it is probable tha
t it will incur a loss of at least $750 million for all potential damages described above.  This amount is based on assumptions about the number,size, and type of structur
es damaged or destroyed, the conte nts of such structures, the numb er and types of trees damaged or destroyed, as well as assumptions aboutpersonal injury damages, a
ttorneys’ fees, fire suppression costs, and other damages that the Utility could be liable for under the theories of inverse condemnation and/or negligence.
 
The Utility believes tha
t it is reasonably possible that it will incur losses related to Butte fire claims in excess of $750 million accrued through December 31, 2016 butis currently unable to rea
sonably estimate the upper end of the range of losses bec ause it is still in an early stage of the evaluation of claims, the mediation andsettlement process, and d
iscovery.  The process for estimating costs associated with claims relating to the Butte fire requires management to e xercise significant judgment based on a number of assu
mptions and subjective factors.  As more information becomes known, including additional discovery from the plaintiffs andresults from the ongoi
ng mediation and settlement process, management estimates and assumptions regar ding the financial impact of the Butte fire may result inmaterial incre
ases to the loss accrued.  
The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Butt e fire in an aggregat e amount ofapproximately $900 mill
ion.  Such insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the applicable policies and may not be sufficient to cover the Utility’sultimate liability.
 
The Utility records insuran
ce recoveries when it is deemed probable that a recovery will occur and the Utility can reasonab ly estimate the amoun t or its range.  TheUtility has recorded $625 mi
llion for probable insurance recoveries in connection with losses related to the Butte fire.  While the Utility plans to seek recovery of allinsured losses, it is unable to p
redict the ultimate amount and t iming of such insurance recoveries.  In addition, the Utility is pursuing coverage under the insurancepolicies of its two vegeta
tion management contractors, including under policies where the Utility is listed as an additional insured .  Recoveries of any amounts under these policies are unc
ertain.  If the ultimate liability exceeds the amounts recovered through insurance, the Utility would expect to seek authorization from the CPUCand the FERC to recover any exce 
ss amounts from custom ers.   The Utility is unable to predict the timing or outcome of any such proceeding, or the timing ofrecovery from custome
rs, if any.  The resolution of claims, any future regulatory proceeding, and the recoveries from other potentially responsible partie s and customers could extend over 
a number of years. (For more information, see “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements in 
Item 8.) 
Department of Interior Inquiry
 
In September 2015, the Utility was no
tified that the DOI had initiated an inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or debarred from entering into federalprocurement and non-procur
ement contracts and programs citing the San Bruno explosion and indicating, as the basis fo r the inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping,poor identification and 
evaluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB’s investigation.  The Utility filed its initial response on November 2, 2015 todemonstrate that i 
t is a “presently responsib le” contractor under federal procurement regulations and that it believes suspension or debarment is not appropriate.  OnApril 8, 2016, the Utility rece
ived a series of follow-up questions from the DOI regarding its November 201 5 submission.   On November 21, 2016, the Utility provided the DOI with a supplementa
l submission in which it addressed the DOI’s April 8, 2016 questions.   The Utility continues to fully cooperate with the DOI. 
60
 

 As a result of the August 9, 2016 jury’s 
verdict in the feder al criminal trial, the Utility updated its registration on the federal government’s System for AwardManagement (SAM), a federa
l procurement database, to reflect the verdict.  Under federal law, the government may not enter into a contr act with any corporation that was convicted of a fe
lony criminal violation under any federal law within the preceding 24 months, where the awarding agency is aware of the conviction, unlessan agency has considered suspension o
r debarment of the corporatio n and made a determina tion that this action is not necessary to protect the interests of thegovernment. 
 
On December 21, 2016, the Utility and th
e DOI entered into an interim administrative agreement that reflects the DOI’s determination that the Utili ty remains eligible to contract with feder
al government agencies while the DOI determines whether any further action is necessary to protect federal government’s business interests. The agreement will be e
ffective until superseded by an amended agreement or determination.  The ag reement also provides that the DOI is still conducting a review todetermine whether the Ut
ility has an effective compliance and ethics program and that the DOI is required to use its best efforts to complete its review before the end of 2017.  If the DOI determines th
at the Utility’s program is not generally effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct, the Utility may be required to enterinto an amended administrati
ve agreement and implement remedial and other measures, such as a requirement th at the Utility’s natural gas operations and/orcompliance and ethics p
rograms be supervised by one or more in dependent third party monitor(s) .  
The Utility could incur ma
terial costs, not recoverable through rates, to implement r emedial and other me asures that could be imposed, the amount of which theUtility is currently unab
le to estimate.

 R
EGULATORY
MATTERS 
The Utility is subject to subst

2017
General
Rate
Case
 
On September 1, 2015, the Utility fi
led its 2017 GRC application with the CPUC.  On August 3, 2016, the Utility, together with ORA, TURN, and 12 otherintervening parties f
iled a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement that resolves nearly all of the issues raised by the parties in the Utility’s2017 GRC.  All parties who filed testimony in 
the case joined the settlement agreement , which was the subject of a one-day workshop ov erseen by the assignedcommissioner and ALJ.  The settl
ement agreement will ultimately be considered by the full commission.  In the GRC proceeding, the CPUC will determine the annualamount of base revenues 
(or “revenue require ments”) that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 or 2020 to recover itsanticipated costs for 
electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and electric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rateof return.  (The Utility’s 
revenue requirements for other portions of its operations, such as electric transmission, natural gas transmission and storage services, andelectricity and na
tural gas purc hases, are authorized in o ther regulatory proceedings overseen by the CPUC or the FERC.) 
Revenue
Requirements
and
Attrit
ion
Year
Revenues 
The settlement agre
ement proposed that the Utility’s 2016 authorized revenue requirement of $7.9 billion be increas ed by $88 million, effect ive January 1, 2017.  Thesettlement agree
ment further proposed an increase to the authorized 2017 revenues of $444 million in 2018 and an additional increase of $361 million in 2019, asshown in the table below.
 
The settlement ag 
reement identifi ed two contested issues.  First, the parties were unable to agree on whether there should be a third post-test year or “attrition” yearfor this GRC cycle.  ORA and the Utility reco
mmend a third post-test year for this cycle that would prov ide for an additional in crease of $361 million in 2020. TURN and certain other settling p
arties oppose the third post-test year.  The other contested issue concerns whether the Utility should be authorized to establish a newbalancing account for cos
ts ar ising from the CPUC’s rulemaking on natu ral gas leak abatement.  The Utility and certain settling parties support the balancingaccount.  TURN and certain other se
ttling parties do not.  ORA does not oppose it.  Interested parties filed comments and reply comments on the contested issues andthese issues were also discussed 
at a one-day workshop on August 30, 2016.  
The table below summariz
es the differences between the amount of revenue requirement increases included in the Utility’s request, as updated in the Utility’s supplemental testimony

The settlement agreement 
propose d reductions in the following areas forecast in the GRC application.  For gas distribution, reductions are proposed for corrosioncontrol, leak managem
ent, gas operations technology, and new business.  For electric distribution, reductions are propo sed for overhead mainten ance, capacity,technology, mapping and records, 
reliability, substation management, new business, and undergrounding work.  For electric distribution, the capital-related reductionsare offset in part by increa
ses in the replacemen t and installation of ad ditional units in specific asset areas.  For electric generation, the settlement agreement proposed 
to move costs related to Diablo Canyon seismic studies from the GRC to the Utility’s Energy Resource Recovery Account proceeding.  P roposed reductions in the customer service area largely relate t
o the removal of certain costs from the forecast related to residential rate reform implementation.  Some of these costs would berecoverable through the 
existing Residential Rates Reform Memo randum Account, and the Utility could seek recovery of the remaining costs in a future filing withthe CPUC.  Additionally, a number of company-wid
e reductions, including reductions to the Short-Term Incentive Plan and certain employee benefits, are propos ed in the settlement agreement.

 Balancing
Accounts
 
The settlement agre
ement proposes to retain certain existing balancing accounts, including the Tax Act Memo Account that was first established following the TaxRelief, Unemployment Insuran
ce Reauthorization, and Job Creat ion Act of 2010, and to eliminate certain memorandum and balancing accounts that are no longernecessary.  In additio
n to the contested balancing account for natural gas leak abatement mitigation costs, the settlement agreemen t proposes one new tax-relat edmemorandum account to t
rack the impact on the revenue requirement from certain types of changes in tax laws or regulations. 
Capital
Additions
and
Rate
Base
 
The settlement agre
ement proposes capital expenditures of $3.9 bill ion for 2017 for the portions of th e Utility’s business addressed in the GRC.  Proposed capitalexpenditures are lower th
an the amount included in the GRC application of $4.0 billion for 2017, consistent with the provisions of the settlement agreement.  Wh ile the settlement agr
eement proposes overall revenue requirement increases for 2018 and 2019, it does not specify capit al expenditures for those y ears.  At the August30, 2016 workshop, t 
he Utility estimated authorized capital expenditures of $3.6 billion for 2018 and $3.5 billion for 2019, based on a calculation method that is subject to CPUC approval, 
as compared to its reques t of approximately $4.0 billion each year. The Utility is unable to predict if the CPUC will approve its proposedcalculation meth 
od.  
The settlement agre
ement proposes a 2017 weighted average rate base of $24.3 billion for the portions of the Utility’s business reviewed in the GRC, compared withthe Utility’s request of $24.5 b
illion.  The $200 million difference is primarily due to the lower level of capi tal expenditur es agreed to in the sett lement.  At theAugust 30, 2016 workshop, t 
he Utility also estima ted a weighted average rate base of $25.4 billion for 2018 and $26.3 billion for 2019, compared with the Utility’srequest of $25 
.7 billion and $26.9 billion, respe ctively. 
Evidentiary hearings were h
eld on September 1, 2016.  A workshop was held on January 11, 2017 to further explo re the three-year versus four-year rate case cycle. Under the current schedule, 
a final CPUC decisio n is e xpected to be issued in the f irst half of 2017.  On March 17, 2016, the CPUC issued a decision to allow the authorized revenue requ
irement changes to become effective on January 1, 2017, even if the final decision is issued after that date. 
PG&E Co 
rporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether the CPUC will approve the settlement agreement.
2015
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Case
 
On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final decision in phas
e one of the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case.   T he decision adopts the revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to 
collect through rates beginning August 1, 2016, to recover its costs of gas transmission and storage services for the 2015 GT&S ra te case period (see table below) 
.   The decision authorizes the Utility to collect, over a 36-month period, the difference between adopted revenue requirements and amountspreviously collected in 
rates, retroactive to January 1, 2015.  A ccounting rules allow the Utility to recognize revenues in a given y ear only if they will be co llectedfrom customers within 24 m 
onths of the end of that year.  A s a result, the Utility wil l complete recording $102 million of the retroactive reve nue requirement increase in the firs
t quarter of 2017 .  
The phase one decision 
excludes from rate base $696 million of capital sp ending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted.  The decision permanentlydisallows $120 million of that 
amount and orders that the remaining $576 million be subject to a third party audit ove rseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibili tythat the Utility may se
ek recovery in a future proceeding.  The decision also establishes various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the current ratecase cycle including new one
-way capita l bal ancing accounts.  I n the second quarter of 2016, the Ut ility incurred charges of $190 million for capital expendituresthat the Utility beli
eves are probable of disallowance based on the decision. This includes $134 million to the net plant balance fo r 2011 through 2014 capital expenditures in excess of adop
ted amounts and $56 million for the Utility’s estimate of 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that are probable of exceeding authorized amounts.  The Util
ity took an additional charge of $29 mill ion in the fourth quarter o f 2016 related to 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that areforecasted to exceed 
authorized amounts.  Additional charges may be r equired in the future based on the Utility’s ability to manage its capital spending and o n the outcome of the CPUC’s 
audit of 2011 through 2014 capital sp ending. 
The phase one decision denies th
e Utility’s request for full balancing account treatment for recovery of authorized transportation and storage revenue requirements for non-core customers 
, and instead continues the r evenue sharing mechanism authorized in the 2011 GT&S rate case that subjects a portion of the Utility’stransportation and storag
e revenue requirement to market risk. 
The phase one decision also autho
rizes the Utility’s reque st for cost recovery of up to $157 million for the construction of Line 407, a 25.5 mile, 30-inch pipeline inthe Sacramento Valley exp
ected to be built during this rate case pe riod.  The authorized revenue r equirements will begin when Line 407 becomes ope rational.  The decision also authorizes 
the Utility to track costs exceeding $157 mi llion in a memorandum a ccount.  A reasonableness review of al l costs for Line 407 will take placein t 
he next GT&S rate case.65
 

            
 
On August 1, 2016, 
TURN , ORA, and Indicated Shippers fil ed an appl ication for rehear ing of the phase one decision.  The applica tion indicates that the decision contains language suggesting th
at the authorized revenue requirement is to comply with new federal and state safety mandates and should be removed from the finaldecision, allows recovery of sh
areholder costs in rates , and improperly sequences the calculation of the San Bruno Penalty and the ex parte disallowance.   The Utility filed a response on August 16, 2016.  
The Utility ca nnot predict when or if the CPUC will grant the rehearing or if it will adop t the parties’ recommendations.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                       
 
On 
December 1, 2016, the CPUC approved a final decision in phase two of the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case , regarding the $850 million penalty ass essed in the Penalty 
Decision.  The final phase two decision applies $689 million of the $850 mill ion penalty (81 percent) to capital expenditures and the remaining $161 million(19 percent) to expenses, and 
then reduce s the 2015 revenue requirement by $72 million for the five - month delay caused by the Utility’s violation of the CPUC exparte communication 
rules in this proceeding ($57 million of the $72 mil lion total ex parte disallowance was recognized in 2016 and the remaining $15 million will berecognized in the firs

decision reduce s rate base by the full amount of the disallowed capital expenditures bu t does not remove the asso ciated deferred taxes, which the Utility believes cre
ates a normalization violation.  In the final decision, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to establish a Tax Normali zation Memorandum A ccount to track relevant costs and 
clarifies that i t does not intend t he rate base offset or the  penalty generally, to create tax timing differe nces.  The final decision a lso affirmsthe CPUC’s intention to 
comply with normalizat ion rules and to avoid the potential adverse consequences of a finding of a normalization vi olati on by the IRS. Pursuant to the final phase two de
cision, on February 6, 2017, the Utility submitted an advice l etter to the CPUC to provide 30 days advance notice o f the Utility’s request to the 
IRS for a private letter ruling to determine whether the ado pted rate base offset complies with IRS normalization rules.  The final decision author izesthe Utility to subsequently se
ek an appropriate adjustment to its rev enue requirements and r ate base if the IRS finds a normalization vio lation. 
On January 4, 
2017, TURN, ORA and Indicated Shi ppers filed an applica tion for rehearing of the phase two decision.  Specifically, the applica tion argues that the decision inappropriate
ly sequenced the San Bruno Penalty and the ex parte ratemaking disallowance.   The Util ity filed a response on Janua ry 19, 2017.  The Utility cannot predict when or if th
e CPUC will grant the rehearing. 
With the addition of a th
ird attrition year, the Utility’s next GT&S cycle will begin in 2019.  The decision requires the Utility to file i ts next GT&S application in 2017.

On July 29, 2015, the Utility requested a 2016 
retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.515 billion, a $314 mill ion increase over the pr evious year’sauthorized revenue 
requirement of $1.201 bill ion.  The Utility’s proposed rates went into effect on March 1, 2016, subject to refund, and pending a final decision bythe FERC.  On September 1, 2016, the Utility and othe
r settling parties (including the CPUC) filed a motion a t the FERC for approval of a settl ement proposing thatthe Utility’s 2016 retai
l electric transmission revenue requirement be set at $1.331 billion, a $130 million increase over the previous year’s a uthorized revenuerequirement.  
The Utility also filed a motion on September 1, 2016, request ing the implementation of interim rates , which was an agreed upon term of the settlement.  
The motion was granted and, as a r esult, the interim rates became effective for wholesale customers on September 1, 2016 and for retail customers on October 1, 2016.  The FERC approved the settlem
ent on November 17, 2016. 
On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed a r
ate case at the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue r equirement of $1.718 billion, a $387 million in crease over the 
2016 revenu e requirement of $1.331 bil lion .  The forecasted network tr ansmission rate base for 2017 is $6.7 billion.  The Utility is also seeking areturn on equity of 10.9% which inc
ludes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the U tility’s continuing par ticipation in the CAISO.  In the filing, the Utilityforecasted that it wi
ll make investments of $1.296 billion in 2017 in various capital projects.  
On September 30, 2016, the FERC issued an order acc
epting the Utility’s July 201 6 filing and set it for se ttlement negotiations.  The order set an effective date forrates of March 1, 2017, and made 
the rates subject to hearing and re fund.  The next settlement conference is scheduled for March 16 and March 17, 2017. 
CPUC
Cost
of
Cap
ital 
O 
n February 6, 2017, the Utility and other California IOUs entered into a MOU with the CPUC, ORA, and TURN to extend the next cost of capital application filingdeadline two years to April 22, 2019 fo
r the year 2020.  To implement the MO U, on Februar y 7, 2016, the IOUs , ORA, and TURN filed with the CPUC a petition for modification of pr
ior CPUC decisions addressing the cost of capital.  If the petition for mod ification is approved as submitted it would reduce the Utility’s ROEfrom 10.40% to 10.25% and reset th
e Utility’s authorized cost of long-term debt and preferred stock beginning January 1, 2018.  The long-term debt cost r eset will reflect actual e
mbedded costs as of the end of August 2017 and forecasted interest rates for the new long-term debt scheduled to be issued for the remainder of 2017and all of 2018. 
  The Utility’s current capital structure of 52% common equity, 47% long-ter m debt, and 1% preferred equity would remain unchanged.  
If and once the 
petition for modification is granted by the CPUC, each IOU will submit to the CPUC in September 2017 its respective updated cost of capital andcorresponding revenue requi
rement imp acts with an eff ective date of January 1, 2018.  While the actual changes to  the Utility’s revenue requirement resulting fromthe 
petition for modification will not be known until the Utility ’s filing in September 2017, the Utility estimates that its annua l revenue requiremen t will be reducedby approximately $100 mill
ion, beginning in 2018.  These estimates are based on current and forecasted market interest rates.  Changes in market interest rates canhave material effects on the co
st of the Utility’s fut ure financings and consequent ly on the estimated change in annual revenue requirements. 
The Utility’s cost of capi
tal adjustment mechanism would not operate in 2017 but could operate in 2018 to change the cost of capital for 2019.  If the mechanism is activated for 2019, the Utility
’s cost of capital, including its new ROE of 10.25%, will be adjusted according to the ex isting terms of the me chanism.  Concurrently with the petition for modif
ication, the Utilit y and other California IOUs sent a letter to the executive director of the CPUC requesting that the existing April 2017 filing duedate for the 2018 cost of cap
ital be deferred while the CPUC is considering the petition for modif ication.  On February 13, 2017, the executive dir ector of the CPUCgranted 
the request. As extended, the Uti lity and the other California IOUs would file their next cost of capital applications 60 days after the effective date of theCPUC decision on the petition for modif
ication, or April 20, 2017, whichever is later, if the CPU C does not grant the petition fo r modification.   The Utility expects that the CPUC may issue a deci 
sion in the first half of 2017.

Joint
Proposal
for
Plant
Retirement

On August 11, 2016, the Utility submitted an app
li cation to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 andreplace it with a port
folio of energy efficiency and GHG-free resources.  The application implements a joint proposal between the Utility an d the Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, Env
ironment California, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, Coalition of California Utility Employees,and Alliance for Nuclear Respons
ibility. 
The application and 
joint proposal include a volun tary increase in the Utility’s target for RPS-eligible resources to 55%, effective in 2031 through 2045, as comparedto the state’s goal of 50% 
renewables.   The parties to the joint proposal proposed that the Utility be authorized to procure GHG-fre e replacement resources in threecompetitive procure
ment tranches: in Tranche 1, the Utility would be authorized to obtain 2,000 gross GWh of energy efficiency savings to be implemented over the2018 to 2024 time period; in Tra 
nche 2, the Utility would be author ized to procure through a solicitation 2,000 GWh of GHG-free energy resources that willcommence energy deliv
eries or add energy efficiency projects to the system in the 2025 to 2030 time period; and in Tranche 3, the Uti lity would commit to a voluntary 55% RPS 
beginning in 2031 , and would maintain this volunta ry commitment through 2045 or until superseded by action of the state legislature or theCPUC. 
  The three tranches of resource procurement in the application and joi nt proposal are not intended to specify all energy resources that will be needed to ensurethe orderly replace
ment of Diablo Canyon. Instead, the Utility expects that the full solution will be addressed in ongoing CPUC proceedings.  
Costs associated with 
energy efficiency pro jects or programs in Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 would be recovered through the Utility’s electric public purpose program rates as non-bypassable cha
rges, consistent with the existing recovery mechanisms for energy efficiency program cost s.  GHG-free energy resources costs fromTranche 2 are proposed to be r
ecovered through a non-bypassable cost allocation mechanism called the Clean California Charge that (1) equitably allocates costs andbenefits, such as RPS or Resource Adequacy cr
edits, associated with the procur ement among responsible load-serving entities, and (2) determines the net capacitycosts of such procurement cons
istent with the methodology for the allocation of net capacity costs laid out by the CPUC.  Costs associated with pr ocurement for Tranche 3 would be recovered th
rough a separate renewable non-bypassable charge.   
The application seeks conf
irmation from the CPUC that the Utility’s full investment in Diablo Canyon and authorized rate of return will be recovered in rates by the time the facili
ty ceases operations.  Additionally, the Utility r equests that the CPUC pre-approve the recovery of certain costs related to the closure of the DiabloCanyon.  These include the non-bypassabl
e cost allocation mechanism for procurement of GHG-free energy and the recov ery of $1.3 billion for administration andacquisition of the new Tranch
e 1 energy efficiency procurement as authorized energy efficiency funding, subject to return of all unspent funds; the recovery ofemployee retention an 
d retraining and developm ent programs to continue safe and efficient operation of Diablo Canyon through the end of its license periods,estimated at approximately $3 
6 0 million; and a community mitigation program to compensate San Luis Obispo County for the decline in local econo mic stimulusprovided by Diablo Canyon through a transi
tion period ending in 2025 , estimated at $85 million. The Utility also s eeks cost recovery of approximately $50 million incosts related to the f
ederal and state Diablo Canyon li cense renewal process.  
More than 40 parties have subm
itted responses and protests to the Utility’s applic ation.  A prehearing conference on the applicati on was held on October 6, 2016 and public participation h
earings were held in San Luis Obispo on Octob er 20, 2016.  On November 18, 2016, a scoping memo was issued that set the schedule anddetermined that land 
issues would be out of the scope of this proceeding.  In December 2016, the Utility filed with the CPUC the community impact mitigationprogram set 
tlement agreemen t of $85 million, compared to $50 million included in the original joint proposal filed on August 11, 2016.  Intervenor testimonies were submitte 
d to the CPUC in January 2017.  Several intervenors indi cated their support to retire Diablo Ca nyon at the expiration of i ts current operating licen ses in 2024 and 2025.  Several p 
arties argued , however , that a component of the employee reten tion program and community impact mitigation prog ram be funded by shareholders.  
Several intervenors also sub mitted proposals for mo difications to certain aspects of the three GHG-free replacement tranches. Several parties recommended that the license re
newal project cost r ecovery request be rej ected and/ or be paid for by bo th customers and shareholde rs.  There were no direct challenges to the Diablo Canyon r
emaining net book value cost recovery proposal.  Rebuttal testimony and comments on the community impact mitigation programsettlement agree
ment are scheduled to be submitted to the CPUC on March 17, 2017 and evidentiary hearings a re scheduled to take place in April 2017.  Opening andreply briefs are due on May 26, 2017 
and June 9, 2017, respectively.  The Utility expects that a final decision will be issued by the end of 2017.   Upon CPUCapproval of the appl 
ication and such approval becoming fin al and non-appealable , the Utility will withdraw its license renewal application currently pending beforethe NRC 
.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether the CPUC will approve the application.

Lease
 
On June 28, 2016, California State Lands Commiss
ion approved a new lands lease for the intake and discharge structures at Diablo Canyon to run concurrently withDiablo Canyon’s current operat
ing licenses, until Diablo Canyon Unit 2 ceases oper ations in August 2025.  The Utility believes that the approval of the new lease willensure sufficient ti
me for the Utility to identify and bring online a portfolio of GHG-free replacement resources.  The Utility will submit a future lease extensionrequest to address the per
iod of time required for plant decommissioning, which under NRC regulations can take as long as 20 years.  On August 28, 2016, the WorldBusiness Academy (WBA) filed a writ 
in the Los Angeles Superi or Court.  WBA asserts that the Stat e Lands Commission committed legal error when it determinedthat the short term l
ease extension for an existing facility was exempt from review under the California Environmental Quality Act.  If the petitioner prevails in its challenge, the State Lands Com
mission could be required to perform an environmental review of the new lands lease.  Th e court has set a trial date of July 11, 2017,with the 
petitioner’s opening brief due February 27 , 2017, opposition briefs due Ap ril 24, 2017, and reply briefs due M ay 22, 2017 . 
Asset
Retirement
Obligations
 
The Utility expects that 
the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon will take many years after the expiration of its current operating licenses.  Detailed studies of the cost to de 
commission the Utility’s nu clear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP.  Actual decommissioning costs may varyfrom these estimat
es as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulator y requirements; techno logy; and costs of labor, materials, andequipment.  The Utility re
covers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects willcontinue until those costs a
re f ully recovered.  
On March 1, 2016, the Utility submitt
ed its updated decommissioning cost estimate with the CPUC.  The estimated undiscounted cost to decommission the Utility’snuclear power plants incr
eased by approximately $1.4 billion, for a total estim ated cost of $4.8 billion, due to increased estimated costs related to spent fuel storage,staffing, and out-of-sta
te waste disposal.  The Utility requested that the CPUC authorize the collection of increased annual revenue requirements beginning on January 1, 2017 based on 
  these updated cost estimates. 
While the NDCTP forecast includes 
employee severance program estimates, it does not include estimated costs related to the joint proposal’s employee retention andretraining and developm
ent programs, and t he San Luis Obispo County community mitiga tion program described above.  The Utility intends to conduct a site-specificdecommissioning study to update 
the 2015 NDCTP forecast and to submit the study to the CPUC by mid-2019.  
On July 15, 2016, the assign 
ed CPUC commissioner and ALJ issued a scoping memo for the Utility’s 2015 NDCTP and excluded from the scope of the proceedingthe issue on whether the Utili
ty should be required to present additional analysis for a license extension scenario for Diablo Can yon, as a result of the Utili ty’sannouncement of its plan to no
t seek relicensing of Diablo Canyon beyond its current operating authority.  The scoping memo also adopts within the scope of theproceeding a reasonablen
ess review of the Utility’s estimated u pdated cost to decommission the Utility’s nuclear power plants and of the forecasts of certain expensesand the decommissioning trus
t funds’ rates of return.  Evidentiary hearings took place in September 2016 and opening briefs were submitted on October 14 , 2016. Intervenor parties propos
ed several major recommendations including a reduction to the total spent nuclear fuel storage forecast, a reduction to the large component(reactor vessels, ste
am generators, and other large plant components) removal cost estimate, and a reduc tion to the waste disposal estimate.  Additionally, intervenorsasserted that the CPUC should not permi
t the Utility to increase its Diablo Canyon-related revenue requirement at this time as it has not demonstrated its currentestimate 
is reasonable. Parties a lso claimed that the Utility has not justified its increase to security costs and decommissioning oversight contractor staff costs.  Noparty challenged the Uti
lity’s decommissioning trust funds rates of return or cost escalation as sumptions.  Reply briefs were submi tted on October 31, 2016. Intervenor parties r
eiterated that the Utility has not justified increases in costs due to large component removal, site security, decommissioning contractor staff, spentnuclear fuel storage, a 
nd waste disposal.  The Utility conf irmed that the testimony and work papers support the cost increases as well as the total estimate todecommission Diablo Canyon.
 
The estimated nuclea
r decommissioning cost is discounted for GAAP purposes and recognized as an ARO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The total nucleardecommissioning obligation 
accrued in accordance with GAAP was $ 3.5 billion at December 31, 2016, which includes an $818 million ad justment to reflect theincreased cost estim
ates and a $115 million increase r esulting from the joint proposal described above, and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2015.  These estimates arebased on decommissioning cost stud
ies, prepared in accordance with the CPUC requirements.  Changes in these estimates could mat erially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.

 As of December 31 
, 2016, the nuclear decommiss ioning trust accounts’ total fair value was $2.9 billion.  Changes in the estimated costs, the timing ofdecommissioning or the assump
tions underlying these estimates  could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission.

Culture
 
On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation 
into whether the organizational cultur e and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prioritizesafety and adequately di
rect resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards.  The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate the Utility’s andPG&E Corporation’s organizatio 
nal culture, governance, po licies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record of operations, including itsrecord of safety incid
ents.  The CPUC authorized the SED to engage a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation a nd the preparation of a r eport containing theSED’s assessment.  The consultant’s work beg
a n in the second quarter of 2016.  
The CPUC stated that the initial ph
ase of the proceeding was categorized as rate setting because it will consider issues both of fa ct and policy and because th e Utilityand PG&E Corporation do not face the prosp
ect of fines, penalties, or remedies in this phase.  Upon completion of the consultant’s report, the assigned commissionerwill determine the scop
e of any next actions in the pr oceeding.  The timing, scope and po tential outcome of the investigation are uncertain.

Incentive
Awards 
On December 15, 2016, the CPUC approved a final 2014 - 2015 Ene
rgy Efficiency Incentive Award of $16.3 million, compared to the Utility’s request o f $19.1million.  The award i
ncludes a $5.8 million reduction reflecting the approved settlement agreement related to the rehearing of the 2006 - 2008 customer energyefficiency sharehold
er incentives .  The settlement agreement re quires the Utility to reduce future energy efficiency shareholder incentives by $29.1 million , which will be applied in instal
lments of $5.8 million per year for five years, provided that the Utility has sufficient energy efficiency incentive awards to off set that amount. Due to the application of th
e first offset of $5.8 million, the required future energy efficiency reduction currently corresponds to $23.3 million.  If shareholder incentives are insufficient to
 offset this amount, the offset in the follo wing year will be increased by the shortf all.  At its discretion, the Util ity may increase theamount of the offset to r
educe the remaining offset oblig ation more quickly.  If the amount has not been fu lly offset at the end of five years, the balance will be credited against futu
re energy efficiency program spending. 
LEGISLATIVE
AND
REGULATORY
IN
ITIATIVES 
The California Legislatu
re and the CPUC have adopted requirements, policies , and decisions to improve and refine gas and electric safety citation programs,implement new state law re
quirements applicable to natural gas storage facilities , accommodate the growth in distributed electric generation resources (includingsolar installa 
tions), increase the a mount of renewable energy delivered to customers, promote customer energy efficiency and dema nd response programs, and foster the development of a state-
wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage the use of electric ve hicles.   In addition, the CPUC continues to implement statelaw requirements to reform electric
 rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of service, reduce cross-subsidization among customer rate classes,implement new rules for n
et energy metering (which currently all ow certain self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate),and allow customers to have gr
eater control over their energy use.   CPUC proceedings related to some of these matters are discussed below.   
The Utility’s ability to 
recover its costs, including investments associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as its electricity procurement and otheroperating costs, will, in la
rge part, depend on the final form of legislative or regu latory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can betimely adjusted to reflect chan
ges in customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas service.     
Gas
and
Electric
Safety
Citation
Program

The SED periodically audits uti
lity operating practices and conducts investigations of potential violations of laws and regulations applicable to the safety of theCalifornia utiliti
es’ electric and natural gas facilities and operations.  The CPUC has del egated authority to the SED to issu e citations and impose penalties for violations identified 
through audits, in vestigations, or self-r eports.  Under both the gas and electr ic programs, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty foreach violation, 
but if it assesses a penal ty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximu m statutory penalty of $50,000.  The SED may, at its discretion, i mposepenalties on a daily basis, o
r on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day.  
On September 29, 2016, the CPUC issued a final decis
ion adopting improvements and refinements to its gas and electric safety citation programs.  Specifically, thefinal decision refin
es the criteria for the SED to use in determining whether to is sue a citation and the a mount of penalty, sets an administrative limit of $8 million percitation issued, makes se
lf-reporting voluntary in both gas and electric programs, adopts detailed criteria for the utilities to use to voluntarily self-report a poten tial violation, and refines oth
er issues in the programs.  The decision also merges the rules applicable to its gas and electric safety citation programs into a single set ofrules that replace 
the previous safety citation programs and adopts non-substantiv e changes to these programs so that the programs can be similar in structure and process where appropriate.

Natural
Gas
Storage
Facilities

On January 6, 2016, the California Governor o
rdered the DOGGR to issue emergency regulations to require gas storage facility operators throughout California,including the Utility, to co
mply with new safety and reliability measures, including minimum daily inspection of gas storage well heads (using gas leak detectiontechnology such as infrared 
imaging), ongoing verif ication of the mechan ical integrity of all gas storage wells, ongoing measurement of annular gas pressure orannular gas flow within wells, regu
lar testing of all safety valves used in wells, establishing minimum and maximum pressure limits for each gas st orage facility in the state, and establish
ing  a comprehensive risk management plan that evaluates and prepares for risks at each facility, including corrosion potential of pipes andequipment. 
  On February 5, 2016, the DOGGR adopted the emergency regu lati ons.  The Utility implement ed the regulations and submitted an Underground StorageRisk and Integrity Managemen
t Plan on August 5, 2016 that is pending DOGGR approval. 
Additionally, in September 2016, th
e California Governor signed SB 887 directing DOGGR and CARB to develop permanent regulat ions for gas storage facilityoperations in California, whi
ch are expected to be finalized in the second half of 2017.  The PHMSA has also issued interim final rules effective January 18, 2017regulating gas storage fa 
cilities at the f ederal level.  The Utility may incur significant costs to comply with the new regulations related to (1) the development of anatural gas leak preven
tion and response program, (2) the development of a plan for corrosion monitoring and eval uation, (3) proactive replaceme nt of equipment atrisk of failure, and (4) 
a review of risk management plans to consider new risk factors.  The Utility plans to file an advice letter with the CPUC in the first quarter of2017 to request a memorandum 
accoun t to track the future incremental costs associated with implementing the new regulations.  Upon approval, a subsequentapplication would be submitt
ed to the CPUC for recovery of the incremental costs being tracked.  The Utility is unable to estimate the ti ming and outcome of such request.

New
Renewable
Energy
Targets
 
In October 2015, the California Gove
rnor signed SB 350 into law, which became effective January 1, 2016 .  SB 350 increases the amount of renewable energy thatmust be delivered by most lo
ad -serving entities, inc luding the Utility, to their customers from 33% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020compliance period to 50% o
f their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030 compliance period and in each thre e year compliance period the reafter.  SB350 includes increasing int
erim renewable energy targets for the periods between 2020 and 2030 and continues to include compliance flexibility and waivermechanisms, including inc
reased flexibility to apply excess r enewable energy procurem ent in one compliance period to future compliance periods.  The Utility willincur additional costs to p
rocure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable from customers as “pass-through” costs.  The Util
ity also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets. 
In December 2016, the CPUC issued the first o
f a series of decisions to implement the RPS-r elated provisions of SB 350.  The decision addressed compliance periodsand proc 
urement quantity requi rements.  Subsequent rulings and decisions ar e expected in 2017 to address scope and implementation details. 
Additionally, as stated above, 
the Utility’s application and joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon include a voluntary incr ease in the Utility’s target for RPS-eligibleresources to 55%, effec
tive in 2031 through 2045, as compared to the state’s goal of 50% renewables.

es
Plan 
As required by Californi 
a law, on July 1, 2015, the Utility fil ed its proposed electric distribution resources plan for approval by the CPUC.  The Utility’s planidentifies optimal 
locations on its electric distribution system for deployment of DERs.  The Utility’s proposal is de signed to allow energy technolog ies to beinterconnected with ea
ch other and integrated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.  The Utilityenvisions a future elec
tric grid that would allow customers to choose new advan ced energy supply technologies and services to meet their needs consistent with safe,reliable and affordable electric service
.

 On January 24, 
2017, the CPUC convened a workshop aimed at inform ing the development of a CPUC framework to evaluate grid-modernization inv estments.  Th eworkshop was attended by the Californi
a IOUs , the DE R industry, consumer advocates, the DOE , and the CPUC’s Energy Division staff.  The Energy Division staffis expected 
to develop a grid moderniz ation investment framework in the first quarter of 2017.  Additionally, on February 9, 2017, the CPUC issued a decisionapproving two out of three of the Ut
ility’s proposed field demonstration projects to test various distribution -related services that DERs might provide to the Utili ty. The Utility in unable to pred
ict when a final CPUC decision approving, disapproving , or modifying the Utility’s electric distribution resources plan will be issued.

r two large Ca lifornia IOUs for the deploym ent of cost-eff ective DERs.  The ruling assumed that the incentive would t ake the form of anadditional payment to th
e Utility of 3.5% (grossed up for taxes) of the payments made to the DER provid er(s).  The ruling also state d that it did not intend for this phase to adopt a new regulatory 
framework or business model for the California electric utilities. 
On September 1, 2016, the assigned CPUC commissioner 
and ALJ issued an amended scoping memo and ruling that re-categorized a ll activities in th e proceeding asrate-setting, consolid
ated remaining issues into one phase, and proposed a revised regulatory incentive pilot to test how an earnings opp ortunity affects DER sourcing.  On December 22, 2016, the CPUC issued a final d
ecisi on in the proceeding which authorizes a pilot to test  a regulatory incentive m echanism through which the Utility 
will earn a 4% pre-tax incentive on annual payment s for DERs, as well as test a regulatory process that will allow the Utility to competitively solicitDER services to defer distribu
tion infrastructure.  Each utility is requir ed to conduct at least one pilot, but may conduct up to three additional pilots.

(NEM)  
On July 3, 2015, the CPUC approved a final decision to au
thorize the Cali fornia IOUs to gra dually flatten their tiered residential electric rate structures to two tiers by January 
2019.   The decision approved higher minimum bill charges for residential customers and also allows the imposition of a surcharge on customers with extremely high elect
ricity use beginning in 2017.   The decision requires the Utility to file a proposal by January 1, 2018, to charge residential electric customers basedon time-of-use rates 
(known as “default time-of-use rates”) unless customers elect othe rwise.   The Utility also may propose to impose a fixed charge on residentialelectric customers. 
  Under the CPUC’s decision, default time-of-use rates must be implemented before the CPUC will permit the imposition of a fixed charge inelectric rates. 
  
In 
January 2016, the CPUC adopted new NEM rules .  The new rules became effectiv e for new NEM customers in December 2016, when the Utility reached its NEM cap 
of 2,409 MW.  N ew NEM customers will be required to pay an interconnection fee, will be charged for energy use on time-of-use rates, and will be required topay non-bypassable charges to he
lp fund some of the costs of low-income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.  Unlike the initial NEMtariff, there is no c
ap on the total c apacity of distributed g eneration that can be installed under the new rules , and there is no size lim itation on the projects, so long asprojects over 1MW pay actu
al interconnection costs . On March 7, 2016, the Utility and cer tain other parties, including TURN and CUE, filed applications for rehearing.  The Utility r
equested that the CPUC vacate its January 2016 decision that the Utility asserts contains legal and factual errors.  Many parties argued that theCPUC failed to complete its duti
es under AB 327, which required the CPUC to evaluate th e costs and benefits of NEM.  On September 15, 2016, the CPUC voted todeny the applications for 
rehearing, concluding that good cause had not been established to grant a rehearing and that the NEM decision adopted a s uccessor tariff as required.  
The CPUC indicated that it may rev isit the NEM successor tariff in 2019.

Development 
In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision adop
ting a policy to expand the California utilities’ ro le in developing EV charging inf rastructure to supportCalifornia’s clima
te goals.  On February 9, 2015, the Utility filed an application requesting that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposal to deploy, own, and maintainEV charging stations and 
the asso ciated infrastructure.  On December 15, 2016, the CPUC issued a fina l decision establishing a three-y ear EV program of $130 million (approximat
ely $109 million in capital expenditures) to deploy up to 7,500 charging stations.  Further deployment of light-duty EV infrastructure will be considered in a second phase of 
the proceeding. 
Transportation

(TE)
Application 
SB 350 orders the CPUC, 
in consultation with the C ARB and the CEC , to direct electr ical corporations to file applications for programs and investments toaccelerate widesprea 
d TE.  In September 2016, the CPUC directed the large IOUs to file  projects to accelerate T E in the state, including both on e-year projects (of up to $20 million total) and 
two to five-year programs with a requested revenue r equire ment determined by the u tility.  On Januar y 20, 2017, the Utility filed its TE application with the CPUC 
requesting a total of up to $253 million (approximately $21 1 million in capital expenditures) in program funding over five years (2018 -2022) primarily rela
ted to make-ready infrastructure for TE in medium to heavy-duty sectors.  Protests are due March 6, 2017 and a prehearing conference isscheduled for March 16 
, 2017.  The Utility expects a dec ision to be issued within 12 to 18 months. 
ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS
 
The Utility’s operations a
re subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the Utility’s personnel and the pub
lic.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous wastes; thereporting and reduction of 
CO 2 and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the ai r, water, and soil; the reporting of safety a nd reliability measures fornatural gas storage facilities; 
and the transportation, hand ling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 
.)     
Natural
Gas
Compressor
Station
Sites

The Utility is legally r
esponsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas co mpressorstations. 
  The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.  At December 31, 2016 , $ 299 millio n and $ 135 million was accrued in th
e Consolidated Balances Sheets for estimated undiscounted remediation costs associated with the Topock site and the Hinkley site, respectively.  Costs associa
ted with the Hinkley site are not r ecovered through rates.  (Se e “Environmental Remedia tion Contingencies” in Note 13 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8 .)  
RISK
MANAGEMENT
ACTIVITIES
 
PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownersh
ip of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with advers e changes in commodity prices, interestrates, and counterparty 
credit. 
The Utility actively m
anages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce commodity cost volatil
ity, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non- trading purposes ( i.e . risk mitigation) and not for speculative purposes 
.  The Utility’s risk manage ment activities include the use of physical and financial instrum ents such as forward contracts, futures, swaps,options, and other instruments 
and agreements, most of which are accounted for as derivative instruments.  Some contracts are accounted for as leases. 
73
 
 

Commodity
Price
Risk  
The Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and nuclearfuel necessary for electricity ge
neration and natural gas procurement for core custom ers.  As long as the Utility can con clude that it is probable that its reasonablyincurred wholesale electricity 
procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices will not affect earnings . Suchflu 
ctuations, however, may impact cash flows.   The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers are also fully recoverable through aratemaking mechanism. 
The Utility’s 
current authorized revenue requirement  for natural gas tra nsportation and storage serv ice to non-core customers is not balancing account protected.   TheUtility recovers these 
costs through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts , resulting in price and volumetric risk. (See “ 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
” above . ) 
The Utility uses value-at
-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks.  The Utility’s va lue-at-risk was approximately $ 7 million and $2 million at December 31 
, 2016 and 2015 , respectively .  During 2016 , t he Utility’s approximate high, low, and average values-a t-risk were $7 million, $1 million and $4million, respective
ly. Dur ing 2015 , the value-at-risk a mounts were $2 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively .  ( See Note 9 of the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements 
in Item 8 for further discussion of pr ice risk management activities.) 
Interest
Rate
Risk
 
Interest rate risk s
ensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in marketinterest 
rates.  A t December 31 , 2016 and 2015 , if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt,and cash investments 
, th e impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $ 13 million and $11 million, respectiv ely, based on net variable ra te debt andother interest rate-sensitive in
struments outstanding.   ( See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further d iscussion of interestrates 
.)  
Energy
Procurement
Credit
Risk 
The Utility conducts business with coun
terparties mainly in the energy industry, including the CAISO market, other California investor- owned electric utilities,municipal utiliti
es, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas produc tion companies located in theUnited States and Canada.  If a coun
terparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas,  then the Utility may find it necessary to procureelectricity or gas 
at current market prices, which may be higher than the contract prices. 
The Utility manages cred
it risk associated with its counterparties by assigning cr edit limits based on eva luations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit ratings,and other credit criteria as deeme
d appropriate.  Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.  The Utility executes many energy contracts under mast er commodity enabling agreement
s that may require security (referred to as “Credit Collateral” in the table below).  Credit c ollateral may be in the form of cash orletters of credit.  Th
e Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of  acceptable credit quality or other eligiblesecurities (as deem
ed appropriate by the Utility).  Credit c ollateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current net receivables andreplacement cost exp 
osure exceed contractually specified limits.

 CRITIC
AL
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 
The preparation of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estima tes and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts ofassets and liabiliti
es as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of r evenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The accounting policiesdescribed below are co
nsidered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and material to the financial position and results of opera
tions of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgments and estimates.  Actual resultsmay differ 
materially from these estimates and assumptions .  These acco unting policies and their key ch aracteristics are outlined below. 
Regulatory
Accounting  
As a regulated entity, 
t he Utility records regulatory assets  and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probab le of recovery from, or refund to, customers.  These amounts would otherwise be recorded to 
expense or income under GAAP.  Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Sta
tements in Item 8.  At December 31, 2016 , PG &E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatorybalancing accounts rec
eivable) of $ 9.9 billion and regulatory liabilities (incl uding current regulatory balancing accounts payabl e) of $ 7.7 billion .   
Determining probability re
quires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings,proposed regulatory decisions, 
final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals.  For some of the Utility’s regulatory assets, 
including utility retained generation , the Utility has determ ined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the CPUC .  TheUtility also records a r
egulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery of incurred costsis probable, such as the r 
egulatory assets for pension benefits ; deferre d income tax; price r isk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt. The CPUC has not denied the recovery of any m
aterial costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented.  If the Utility det ermined 
that it is no longer probable th at regulatory assets would be recovered or refl ected in future rates, or if the Utility ceas ed to be subject to rate regul ation, theregulatory assets 
would be charged against income in the period in which that deter mination was made.   I f regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility’s futurefinancial results could bec
ome more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or revenue recognition. 
In addition 
, regulatory accounting st andards require recognition of a   loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposesand if a reasonable est
imate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by m anagement regarding probability ofrecovery, as described abov
e, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets.  The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expected to exceed theamount to be recovered. 
  T he Utility records a provision based on its best estimate; to the extent there is a high degree of uncertainty in the Utility’s forecast, it willrecord a provision based on the 
lower end of the range of possible losses.   The Utility’s capital forecasts in volve a series of complex judgments regarding detailedproject plans, estimates incl
uded in third-party contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards,and a variety of other f
actors.   
The Utility recorded cha
rges of $283 million in 2016 for capit al spending that was disallowed related to the Penalty Decision.  The Utility incurred charges of $219million in 2016 for capit
al expenditures that will be disallowed based on the final phase two decision in its 2015 GT&S rate case.  Additionally, the Utility would berequired to record cha
rges in future periods to the extent PSEP-related capital costs are higher than currently expected.  ( See “ Enforcement and Litiga tion Matters ” in Note 
1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated F inancial Statements in Item 8.) 
Loss
Contingencies

As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utili
ty have recorded material accruals for environmental remediation liabilities and for various enforc ement and legal 
matters, and have recorded insurance receivable s for third-party claims. 
Environmental Remediation Liabiliti
es
The Utility is subject to loss 
contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may requi re the Utility to pay for environmental remed
iation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party.  Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardoussubstances at various potent
ial sites, including former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility fo r thestorage, recycling, or dispos
al of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site. 
75
 

 The Utility generally 
commences the environm ental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potentialsite requiring remedial action.
  (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperationwith regulatory agencies.  For 
example, the Utility has begun a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.)  Based on such notifica tion, the Utilitycompletes an assessment o
f t he potential site and ev aluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred.  The Utility records an environmentalremediation liabi
lity when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the los s or a range of possible losses .  Given the complexities of the legal an
d regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for estimatingremediation liabilities is subjecti
ve and requ ires significant judgm ent.  Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types of hazardoussubstances at a potential
 site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liabilit y in proportion to other responsib leparties, and the extent 
to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. 
When possible, the Utility es
timates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred a t similar sites depend ing on thelevel of information 
available.  Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who areexpected to devote a signi
ficant amount of time directly to the remediation effort.  These e stimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions,operations and maintenance
 activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.   Remediation efforts for a parti
cular site generally extend over a period of several years.  During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, 
thereby possibly affect ing the cost of the remediation effo rt.  
At December 31, 
2016 and 2015 , the Utility ’s accruals for undiscount ed gross environmental liab ilities were $ 958 million and $ 969 million , respectively.  TheUtility’s undiscounted futur
e costs c ould increase to as much as $ 1.9 billion if the extent of contaminatio n or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or ifthe other potentially 
responsibl e parties are not fin ancially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyondregulatory requirem
ents.  Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and rea sonably estimable, esti mated costs mayvary significantly fro
m actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.  
Enforcement and Litigation Matters

PG&E Corporat 
ion and the Utility are subj ect to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims and lawsuits.  In addition, 
penalties may be incur red for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility record aprovision for a loss 
contingency when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG& E Corporation and the Utility evaluat
e the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range , unless an amount within the rang e is abetter estimate 
than any other amount.  T he assessment of whether a loss is p robable or reasonably possibl e, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable,often involves a series of 
complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are rev iewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted t o reflect the impact of all known 
information, such as negotiations, discovery, set tlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to aparticular matt
er.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s policy is to exclude anticipated legal cost s from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incur red .  Management has made signi
ficant estimates and assumptions about accruals related to the Butte fire.  At December 31, 2016, the Utility’s accrual for the Butte firewas $690 million.  Actua 
l results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Sta
tements in Item 8.) 
Insurance Receivable
 
The Utility has 
liability   insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third party claims.  The Utility records insurance recoveries only when a thirdparty claim is recorded and
 it is deemed probable that a recovery of that claim will occur and the Utilit y can reasonably estima te the amount or its range.   Theassessment of whether recov
ery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series of complexjudgments about future even
ts.     I nsurance recoveries are reviewed quarterly   and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact   of all known information, including contractual liability insurance 
policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with sim ilar events, discussions with insurers and other inform ation and eventspertaining to a particular matter. 
  Management has made signi ficant estimates and assumptions about insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire.   (See“Enforcement and Litig
ation Matters” and “Legal and Regulato ry Contingencies” in Note 13   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
76
 

 Asset
Retirement
Obligations

PG&E Corporation and the 
Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair valueand its settlement date 
can be made.  At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset r etirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of therelated long-lived asset.  
The Utility recognize s a regula tory asset or liabilit y for the timing differences b etween the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through the ratemaking pro
cess.   (See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
To 
estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant est imates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,inflation rates, and th
e estimated date of decommissioning.  The estimated future cash flows are disc ounted using a credit-a djusted risk-free rate that reflects the riskassociated with the decom
missioning obligation.  
At December 31, 
2016 , the Utility’s recorded ARO for th e estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was $ 4.7 billion .   Changes in these estimates and assumptions 
could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for thes e assets.  For exa mple, a premature shutdown of the nuclear facilities at Diablo Canyon would increase the like 
lihood of an earlier st art to decommissioning and cause an increase in the ARO.  I f the inflation adjustment or discount rate incre ased 25 basispoints, the result 
would be an immaterial impact to ARO.  
Pension
and
Other
Postretirement
Benefit
 Plans 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
sponsor a non-contributory defined b enefit pension plan for eligible employees a s well as contributory postretirement health care and 
medical plans for eligible r etirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees .  Adjustments to the pension and othe
r benefit obligation are based on the d ifferences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results .  These amounts are deferred in accumulated other c
omprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis.   The differences between pension benefit expense recognized in accordan
ce with GAAP an d amounts recognized for r atem aking purposes are recorded as regulatory asset s or liabilit ies as amounts are probable ofrecovery from customers. 
  To the extent the other ben efits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability.   (See Note 3 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial State
ments in Item 8.)  
The pension and other postreti
rement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date.  The signi ficant a ctuarial assumptions used in determin
ing pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health care costtrend rate and the expe
cted return on plan assets.  PG&E Corporation a nd the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary . While PG&E Corporation and the Util
ity believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes or amendments, or 
significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit oblig ations and future plan expens es.  
I 
n establishing health care cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider rec ent cost tre nds and projections from indust ry experts .  This evaluation suggests that current ra
tes of inflation are expected to continue in the near term.  In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the design ofPG&E Corporation’s plan 
s, the assumed health car e cost trend rate for 2017 is 7.2 % , gradually decreasing to the u ltimate trend rate of 4.5 % in 2 025 and beyond .  
Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then apply ing these returns to the target asset allocations of theemployee benefit trus
ts, resulting in a weighted average rate o f return on plan assets.  Fixed - income returns were projected based on real maturity and credit spreadsadded to a long-term inflat 
ion rate.  Equity returns wer e projected based on estimates of divid end yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term ra te ofinflation.  For the Utility
’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 5.3 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.3 % . 
The rate used to discount pension b
enefits and other benefits was based on a y ield curve developed from market data of approximately 696 Aa-grade non-callablebonds at December 31, 
2016 .  This yield curve has discount r ates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pensionand other postretirem
ent benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted averag e discount rate.

 NOTES
TO
THE
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
NOTE
1:
ORGANIZATION
AND
BASIS
OF
PR
ESENTATION 
PG&E Corporation is a holding company 
whose primary operating subsidi ary is Pacific Gas and Electri c Company, a public utility serving northern and central California.  The 
Utility generates rev enues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.  The Utility is primarily regulated by the CPUC and the FERC.  In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, cons
truction, operation, and decommissi oning of the Utility’ s nuclear generation facilities.  
This is a combined annual repo
rt of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s C onsolidated F inancial S tatements include the accounts of PG& E Corporation, the Utility, and oth
er wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  The Utility’s Consolidated F inancial S tatements include the accounts of the Utility andits wholly owned and controlled subsidi
aries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   The Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements apply to both PG&E Corporat
ion and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial perform ance and allocate resources on a consolidatedbasis (i.e., the compan 
ies operate in one segment). 
The 
accompanying C onsolidated F inancial S tatements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form 10- K.  The preparation of financ
ial statements in conformity with GAAP req uire s the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenu
es and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilitie s.  Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to the Utility’s 
regulatory assets and liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, environmental remediation liabi lities, ARO s, and pension and other postreti rement benefit plansobligations.  Management be
lieves that its estimates and assumptions reflected in the C onsolidated F inancial S tatements are appropriate and reasonable.  A change in management’s esti
mates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that would have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financialcondition and results of 
operations and cash flows during th e period in which such change occurred. 
NOTE
2:
SUMMARY
OF
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUN
TING
POLICIES
Regulation
and
Regulated
Operations
 
The Utility follows accounting p
rinciples for rate-regulated entities and collects rates f rom customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorized bythe CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of provid
ing service.  T he Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenue requirementsthrough rates 
is generally independent, o r “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records assets and liabilities thatresult from the regul
ated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregula ted entities.  The Utility capitalizes and  records, as regulatoryassets, costs that would otherwise b
e charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized overthe future periods 
in which the costs are recover ed.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Utility records thoseexpected future costs as
 regulatory liabilities.  A mounts that are probable of being credited or refun ded to customers in the futu re are also recorded as regulatoryliabilities.
 
The Utility also record
s a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that areprobable of reco 
very or refund.  In addition, t he Utility records a regulatory balancing acco unt asset or liability for differences between in curred costs and customerbillings or authorized r
evenue meant to recover those costs , t o the extent that these differences are pr obable of recovery or re fund .  These differences have noimpact on net income.  (S 
ee “Revenue Recognition” below. )  
Management continues to be
lieve the use of regulatory accounting is applicable a nd that all regulatory assets and liabilitie s are recoverabl e or refundable.  To the extent that portions of th
e Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes inregulation or other re
asons, the related regulatory assets and lia bilities are written off.  
97
 

  
Revenue
Recognition
 
The Utility 
recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas ser vices are delivered .   The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energydelivered to customers bu
t not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Ratescharged to customers ar
e based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. 
The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility
’s revenues i n the Utility’s GRC and its GT&S rate cas es, which generally occur every three or four years.   T he Utility’sability to recover r 
evenue requirements au thorized by the CPUC in these rates cases is independent, or “decoupled” from the volume of the Utility’s sales of electricity and na
tural gas services.   The U tility recognizes r evenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable ofrecovery, and are expec
ted to be collected within 24 months.   Generally, revenue is r ecognized ratably over the year.   
The CPUC also has authorized the Utility 
to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the Utility has been authorized to pass on to customers,including costs to purchase e
lectricity and natural gas; and to fund public purpose, demand r esponse, and customer energy efficiency programs.   In general , the revenue recognition cr
iteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. 
The FERC authorizes the Utility’s r 
evenue requirements in p eriodic (often annual) TO rate cases.   The Utility’s ability to recover revenue requirements authorized bythe FERC is dependent on the volume of the Ut
ility’s electricity sales, and revenue is recognized only for amounts billed and unbilled.  
C
ash
and
Cash
Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist o
f cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at fairvalue. 

Restricted
Cash
 
Prior to October 20 
16, r estricted cash primarily consist ed of the Utility’s cash held in escrow pending the resolution of the remaining disputed claims made by electricity suppli
ers in the Utility’s proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  (See “ Resolution o f Remaining Chapter 11 Disputed Clai ms” in Note13 
below .)  
Allowance
for
Doubtful
Accounts
Receivable

PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cognize an allowance for doubtful accounts to record uncollectable customer accounts receivable at estimated net re alizable value.  The allowance is det
ermined based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables , current economic condi tions, andassessment of customer co
llectability. 
Inventories

Inventories are carried at 
weighted- average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies .   Natural gas stored underground is recorded to 
inventory when injected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribut ion to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.   Materialsand supplies are 
recorded to inventory when purchased and expens ed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed. 
Emission
Allowances
 
The Utility purchases GHG emission al
lowances to satisfy its complianc e obligations.  Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets –other and other noncurrent 
assets – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable throug h rates.  
98
 

 Property,
Plant,
and
Equipment
 
Property, plant, and equipment 
are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value .  Historical costs include labor and materials, construc
tion overhead, and AFUDC.  (See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful liv es and balances of its property, plant, and equipmentwere as follows:

Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories.  Stored nuclear fuel inventory  is stated at weighted- average  cost.  Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as it is used based on the amount of energyoutput.  (See Note 
13 below.) 
The Utility depreciat
es property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to thegross investment 
balance in a particular cl ass of property.  This method approximates the straight line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property, plant,and equipment.  The Utility’s 
co mposite depreciation rates were 3.73 % in 2016 , 3.80 % in 2015 , and 3.77 % in 2014 .   The useful lives of the Utility’s property,plant, and equipment are 
authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is r ecovered through rates charged to customers.  Depreciation expenseincludes a component for th
e original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value at r etirement.  Upon retirement, the original cost of the 
retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned majormaintenance activities and minor
 replacements of property , is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred. 
AFUDC
 
AFUDC

ost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placed in service. AFUDC related to the cost of debt is re
corded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the c ost of equity is recorded in o ther income.  The Utilityrecorded AFUDC 
related to debt and equi ty, respectively, of $ 51 million and $ 112 million during 2016 , $ 48 million and $ 107 million during 2015 , and $ 45 million and $

 The Utility has not recorded 
a liability related to certain ARO’s for assets that are expe cted to operate in perp etuity.  As t he Utility cannot estimate a settlement dateor range of potential se
ttlement dates for these assets , rea sonable estimate s of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not re corded for retirementactivities 
associated with substations, photovo ltaic facilities, and certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain communications equipmen
t from leased property; and restoration or land to the conditions under certain agreements.   
Nuclear
Decommissioning
Obligation
 
Detailed studies of the cos
t to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities a re generally conducted every three years in conjunction with the NuclearDecommissioning Cost Triennial Pro
ceeding conducted by the CPUC.  In   March   2016, the Utility submitted its updated decommissioning   cost estimate to theCPUC.  As a result, the estimat 
ed undiscounted cost to decomm ission the Utility’s nuclear power plants increased by approximately $1.4   billion.   The change intotal estimated cos
t resulted in an $818 million adjustment to the   ARO.   The adjustment was a result of increased estimated   cost s related to spent   fuel storage,staffing, and out-of-sta
te waste disposal.   The decommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristics for the Utility's nuclear powerplants. 
  Actual decommissioning costs may vary from the se estimates as a resu lt of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements;technology; and costs of labor, 
materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers thr ough a non- bypassable charge that th
e Utility expects will continue until   those costs are fully recovered.   The Utility requested that the CPUC authorize the collection of  increased annual revenu
e requirements   beginning on January 1, 2017 based on   these   up dated cost estimates. 
On August 11, 2016, the Utility submitted an app
lication to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 (Unit 1) and2025 (Unit 2). 
  The application includes a joint proposal between t he Utility and certain interested parties, entered into on June 20, 2016 , which result ed in a $115million increase to the 
ARO recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in June 2016.  
The Utility adjusts its nucl
ear decommissioning obligation to reflec t changes in the estima ted costs of decommissioning its nuclear power facilities and records this asan adjustment to the ARO liabil
ity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The total nuclear decommissioning obligation accrued was $ 3.5 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 
2016 and 2015 , respectively.   The estimated undiscounted nuclear decommissioning cost for the Util ity’s nuclear power plants was $ 5.1 billion and $3.5 billion 
at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (or $ 7.3 billion in future dollars), respectively.  These estimates are b ased on the 2016 decommissioning cost studies,prepared in accordanc
e with CPUC requirements. 
Disallowance
of
Plant
Costs
 
PG& 
E Corporation and the Utility r ecord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently comple ted plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  (See “Enfor cement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 below.)
 
Nuclear
Decommissioning
Trusts

The Utility’s nuclear 
generation facilities consist o f two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning r equires the saferemoval of 
a nuclear generation facilit y from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the property for unrestr
icted use.  The Utilit y's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts until authorized forrelease by the CPUC 
.  
The Utility classifies 
its investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trust s as “available-for-sale.”  Sin ce the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust assets aremanaged by external inves
tment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses are consideredother-than-temporary impair 
ments.  Gains or losses on the nucle ar decommissioning trust investments are refundable or recoverable, respectively, from customersthrough rates. 
  Therefore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact on the Util ity’searnings or accumulat
ed other comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securiti es sold by the trust is determined by specif ic identification. 
Variable
Interest
Entities
 
A VIE is an entity that does 
not have sufficient equi ty at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whoseequity investors lack any ch
aracteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controllin g financial interes t in a VIE is a primary beneficiary andis required to consolidat
e the VIE.  
100
 

 Some of the counterparti
es to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power pl ant that would generate electricity for sale to the 
Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary benefic iary of any of these VIE s at December 31, 2016, it assessed whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s expec
ted losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expect ed residual returns under the terms of the power purchase agreement , analyzed the variability in th
e VIE’s gross margin , and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are most significant to the VIE’sperforma 
nce, such as dispatch rights and op erating and maintenance activities.   T he Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amount the Utility pays for delivered electricity and capacity.
  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated wit h any of the activities that are most significant to the economicperformance of any of th
ese VIEs .  Since the Utility was not the prim ary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2016 , it did not consolidate any of them .

 Recently
Adopted
Accounting
Guidance
 
Share- 
B ased Payment Accounting  
In 
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation
–
Stock
Compensation
(Topic
718)
 , which amends the existing guidan ce relating to the accountingfor share-based payment 
awards issued to employees, including the income tax consequenc es, classification of awar ds as either equity or liabilities, and classificationon the statement of cash 
flows.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have adopted this standard as of the fourth quarter of 2016.  
ASU 2016-09 requires recognition of exc
ess ta x benefits and deficien cies in the income statement, which resulted in the recognition of $6.3 million   in income taxbenefit for PG&E Corporation and th
e Utility for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Previously, these amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital. Previously unrecog
nized excess tax benefits were reclassified via a cumulative-effect adjustment .  ASU 2016-09 also requires excess tax bene fits and deficiencies tobe prospectively excluded 
from assumed future proceeds in the calculatio n of diluted shares when calcu lating diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stockmethod.  The effect of th
is change on diluted EPS is immaterial.  Additionally, excess income tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements are now classified as cash flows from ope
rating activities rather than as cash flows from financing activities, which resulted in an increase to cash flows from operating activities ofapproximately $7.2 mill
ion   for the year ended December 31, 2016.  
Furthermore, ASU 
2016-09 requires, on a retrospe ctive basis, that employee taxes paid for withheld shares be classified as cash flows from financing activities ratherthan as cash flows from opera
ting activities.  As such, the consolidated statements of cash flows for PG& E Corporation and the Utility fo r the prior periods presentedwere restated.  This change 
resulted in an increase to cash flows from operating activities and a decrease to cash flows from financing activities of $34.6 million, $26.8million, and $13.2 mill 
ion   for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
PG&E Corporation and th 
e Utility have elected to continue to estimate  forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period and 
h ave not changed their policy on statutory withholding r equirements and will continue to allow the employee to withhold up to the minimum statutory withholding requir
ements. 
Fair Value Measurement
 
In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,

, which standardizes  reporting practices related to the fair value hierarchy for all investments for which fair value is mea sured using net asset value per sha
re.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on their C 
onso lidated F inancial S tatements.  All pr ior periods presented in these Consolidated F inancial S tatements reflect the retrospectiveadoption of this guidance.

idance effective January 1, 2016 and a pplied the requiremen ts retrospectively for all periods presented.  The adoption of this guidancedid not have a materia
l impact on their Consolidated Financial Statements.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility restated $105 million and $103 million, respectiv ely, of debt issuance costs as of Dec
ember 31, 2015 with no impact to net income or total shareholders’ equity previously reported.  All prior periods presented in theseConsolidated Financial State

In  connection  with  the  settlement  agreement  entered  into  among  PG &E  Corporation,  the  Utility,  and  the  CPUC  in  2003  to  resolve  the  Utility’s  proceeding  under  Chapter  11,  the  CPUCauthorized
 the Utility to recover $ 1.2 billion of costs related to the Utility’s retained generation assets.  The individual components of thes e  regulatory assets are being amortized over therespective lives of the underlying generation facilities, consistent wi
th the period over which the related revenues are recognized. ( 
3 ) Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annu al  contribution requirements. As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, t he  Utility expects tocontinuously recover pension benefits.
 
In general, the Utility do
es not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do not accrue interest.  Acco rdingly, the Utility earns a return only on itsregulatory 
assets for retained gen eration , and regulatory assets for un amortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt.

    Regu latory balancing accoun ts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a period exceeding 12 months are recorded as othernoncurrent assets – re
gulatory assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Bala nce Sheets.  These differences do not have an 
impact on net income .  Balancing accounts will fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs are incurred and customer revenues are collected.

INCOME
TAXES

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use th
e asset and liability method of a ccounting for income taxes.  The i ncome tax provision includes current and def erred incometaxes resulting from ope
rations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimat e current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferred tax assetsand liabilities.  Deferred ta
x assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciation expen se.  
PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will be sustainedupon examination by taxing autho
rities based on the merits of the position.  T he tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based on the largestamount of benefit that 
is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, t he difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in future periods and the benefit recogni zed and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecogniz ed tax benefit.  
Investment tax credi
ts are deferred and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation am ortizes its investmen t tax credits over the projected investmentrecovery period. 
  The Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment. 
PG&E Corporation files a consolida
ted U.S. f ederal income tax r eturn that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more. PG&E Corporation files a combined s
tate income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agr eement under which the Utility determines i
ts income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis.

level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC and 2015 GT&S rate case decisions authorized revenue requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related c 
osts for federal tax purposes.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabili
ties.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s andthe Ut 
ility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabili ties as it is probablethat these amounts will be recovered from or returned to cus 
tomers in future rates. (

The component of unrecognized 
tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 3 1, 2016 for PG &E Corporation and the Utility was $ 
25 million .  
114
 

 PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s un
recognized tax benefits may change significantly wi thin the next 12 months due to the resolution of several matters,including audits. 
  As of December 31, 2016, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $ 70 million within the next 12months.  
PG&E Corporation and the Utility bel ieve that the majority of the decrease will not impact net income. 
Interest income, int
erest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  For t he years ended December 31, 2016 
, 2015, and 201 4 , these amounts were immaterial. 
IRS settlements
 
PG&E Corporation previously partic
ipated in the Compliance Assurance Process, a real-time IRS audit intended to expedite resolution of tax matters.  The Compliance Assurance Process audi
t culminates with a letter from the IRS indicating its acceptance of the return.  PG&E Corporation’s participation in theCompliance Assurance Process ended 
effective with the submission of its 2015 tax return .  
PG&E Corporation’s tax returns have b
een accepted through 2015 except for a few matters, the most significant of which relates to deductible repair costs.  In March2016, PG&E Corporation reached an agre
ement with the IRS on deductible electric transmis sion and distribution repai r costs for the 2012 tax year.  The agreementprovided that the methodology us
ed in determining the deductible amount should be followed for all subsequent periods, absent any material change in facts. Deductible repair costs 
fo r other lines of business will continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for subsequent years.  The IRS is expected to issue guidancein 2017 that clarifies whi
ch repair costs are deductible for the natural gas transmission and distribution business es.  
Tax years after 2008 remai
n subject to examination by the state of California. 
2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case
 
In comments to the proposed de
cision in phase two of the 2015 GT&S rate case , the Utility question ed whether the methodology employed to calculate the capital disallowance portion of the San Bruno p
enalty might constitute a normalization violation.  In recognition of this concern, the C PUC , in the final phase two decision, provided the Utility an opportun
ity to submit a ruling to the IRS for guidance and estab lish a memorandum account to track the additional revenue that would berecoverable if the 
method is deemed to be a normalization violation.   The Utility anticipates filing the ruling request in early 2017. 
As a result of 
the final phase two decision, PG&E Corporation and the Utility applied flow through accounting to proper ty - related timing differences for 2016 and 2015 
.

PG&E Corporation believes it is mo
re likely than not the tax benefits associated with the federal and California net operating loss es, charitable contr ibutions and tax credits can be real
ized within the carryforward periods, therefore no valuation allowance was recognized as of December 31, 201 6 for these tax attribu tes.

DERIVATIVES

Use
of
Derivative
Instruments 
The Utility is exposed to commod
ity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities.  Procurement costs are recovered through customerrates.  The Utility uses both de
rivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility  in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.  Derivatives includeforward contracts, swaps, futur
es, options, and CRRs. 
Derivatives are pres 
ented in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets on a ne t basis in accor dance with master nett ing arrangements for each counterparty.  The fairvalue of derivative ins
truments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offset exist.   
Price risk management activities 
that meet the defin ition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These instruments are not heldfor speculative purposes and 
are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Utility expects to fully recover in rat es all costs related to derivatives under the applicable 
ratemaking mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price r isk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.  Therefore, allunrealized gains and losses 
associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilitieson the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Ne
t realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of electrici ty or the cost of natural g as withcorresponding increases or d
ecreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers. 
The Utility elects the n
ormal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives.  Eligible derivatives ar e those that require physi cal delivery in quantities that areexpected to be used by the Util
ity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commoditydelivered.  These 
items are not ref lected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Eligible derivatives are accounted for under the accrual method ofaccounting.

impact of cash collateral postings. ( 
2) These amounts are fully passed through to customers in rates.  Accordingly, net income was not impacted by realized amounts on these instruments. 
Cash inflows and outflows associated with d
erivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Util ity’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
The majority of the Util
ity’s derivatives contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies.  AtDecember 3 
1, 2016 , the Utility’s credit rating was investment grade.  If the Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be requiredto post additional cash im
mediately to fully collateralize some of its n et liability deriv ative positions. 
T 
he additional cash collateral that the Utility would be required to post if the credit risk-related contingency features were triggered was as follows:

FAIR
VALUE
MEASUREMENTS 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility me
asure their cash equivalents, trust assets and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair  value hierarchy isestablished 
that pri oritizes the inputs to va luation methodologies used to measure fair value :  
Level


1
–
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
Level


2
–
Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.  
Level


3
–
Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities. 
The fair value hiera
rchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when meas uring fair value.

V
aluation
Techniques 
The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabi lities shown in the tables abov e.  Equity investments valued at net asset value per share
 utilize investment strategies aimed at matching the performance of indexed funds.  Transfers between levels  in the fair value hierarchy arerecognized as of the end of 
the reporting period.   There were no material transfers between  any levels for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .  
Trust Assets
 
In general, investments h
eld in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market vol atility risks.   N uclear decommissioning trust assets and other trust assets 
are composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-te rm investments that are money market funds valued atLevel 1 
.  Global e quity securities prim arily include i nvestments in common stock th at are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.
 
120
 

  
 
Fixed-income 
securities are pri marily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal secu rities, and other fixed-inc ome securities, includingcorporate debt securi
ties.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable 
market pr ices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2 using evaluated pricing data 
such as broker quotes, for simi lar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant in puts used in the valuation mode l generallyinclude benchmark yield 
curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation model, asapplicable.

and applied it retrospe ctively for the periods presented in th eir Consolidated Financial Statements.  (See Note 2 above.) 
In accordance with this guidance, investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that aremeasured at fair va
lue using the NAV per share practical expedient ha ve not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts areincluded in the tables abov
e in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments include commingled funds that arecomposed of equity securit
ies traded publicly on exchanges as well as fixed-income securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities.  
There are no restric tions on the terms and conditions upon which the inves tments may be redeemed.  
Price Risk Management Instruments
 
Price risk management 
instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, swaps, options, and CRRs thatare traded either on 
an exchange or over-the-counter.  
Power purchase agreements, fo
rwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded forwards and swaps that are valued usingobservable market forward
 prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-tradedforwards and swaps 
, or are valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded optionsare va 
lued using observable marke t data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2.   
Long-dated power purchase agre
ements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued using e ither estimated basis adjust
ments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond a period forwhich market data is ava
ilable.   Market and credit risk ma nagement utilizes models to derive pricing inputs fo r the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3 instrumentsusing 
pricing inputs from br okers and historical data.  
The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financ
ial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is avai lable in the CAISOauction and between auction d
ates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to f orecast forward prices . CRRs are classified as Level 3.  
Level

Measurements
and
Sensitivity
Analysis
 
The Utility’s market 
and credit risk m anagement function, which reports to the Chi ef Financial Officer, is responsible for deter mining the fair value of the Utility’sprice risk manag 
ement derivatives.  The Ut ility’s finance and risk management func tions collaborate to determi ne the appropriate fa ir value methodologies andclassification for 
each derivative.  Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions todetermine reasonableness.
 
Significant increas 
es or decreases in any of thos e inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reason able costs related to Level 3instruments are expec
ted to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to ne t income resulting fro m changes in the fair value of theseinstruments.

Financial
Instruments


PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value for financial instruments:
 
The fair values of cash , restricted cash , net accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, customer deposits, floating rate senior no tes, and the Utility’s variabl
e rate pollution control bond loan agreement s approximate their carrying values at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , as they are short-termin nature or have interest

temaking purposes, which is based on authorized plan contributions.   For pension be nefits, a regulatory asset  or liability is recorded foramounts that would otherwise be r
ecorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.   For post-retirement benefits other than pension, the Utility generally recordsa regulatory liabil
ity for amounts t hat would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.   As the Utility is unable to record a regulatory assetfor these other benefi
ts, the charge remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Expected rates of retu
rn on plan assets were developed by determining projected stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocationsof the employee benefit 
plan trusts, resulting in a weight ed average rate of return on pl an assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based on real maturity and credit spread
s added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were estimated based on es timates of dividend yield and realearnings growth a 
dded to a long-term infl ation rate .  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 5.3 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.3 %.  The rate usedto discount pension 
benefits and ot her benefit s was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 696 Aa-grade non-callable bonds atDecember 31, 
2016 .  This yield curve has discount rates th at vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension benefits and other benefit obliga
tions were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average dis count rate.  
Investment
Policies
and
Strategies
 
The financial position of PG&E Corpor
ation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations. Volatility in funde 
d status occurs whe n asset values change diff erently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial reporting , as well as the amount of minimum con
tributions required under the Employee Retirement In come Security Act of 1974, as amended .  P G&E Cor poration’s and the Utility ’sinvestment policies and 
strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of funded status volatility.  
The trusts 
’ asset allocations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings .   Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants ofPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interes t rate changes also influence liabili
ty valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility , PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trust s hold significant allocations in 
long maturity fixed-income investments . A lthough they co ntribute to funded status vol atility, equity investments are held to reduce long-term fundingcosts due to their higher exp
ected return.  Real assets and absolute return invest ments are held to diversify the trust ’s holdings in equity and fixed- income investments by exhibiting retu
rns with low correlation to the direction of these markets. R eal assets include commodities futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equi
ties, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return investments include hedge f und portfolios .  
127
 

 In the Pension Plan, target al
locations for 2017 were updated to reflect a 2% increase in global equity investments and a 2% decrease in fixed income investments.  Target allocations fo
r PBOP Plans remain unchanged.   Derivative instruments such as equity index futures a re used to meet target equity exposure.   Derivativeinstruments, such as equity ind
ex futures and U.S. treasury futures, are also used to rebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio.   Foreigncurre 
ncy exchange contracts a re used to hedge a portion of the non U.S. dollar exposure of global equity investments.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply 
a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guidingprinciples of this risk
 management framework are the clear articulation of roles an d responsibilities, appropr iate delegation of authority, and proper accountability anddocumentation.  Trust invest
ment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversif ication, manage risk throughappropriat 
e use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.

 Valuation
Techniques
 
The following describes the va
luation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.   All investments that ar e valuedusing a net asset value per sh
are can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days. 
Short-Term Investments

Short-term investments 
consist primarily of comming led funds across government, credi t, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1 andLevel 2 assets.
 
Global Equity
 
The global equity 
category include s investments in common stock and equity-index futures .  Equity investments in common s tock are actively t raded on publicexchanges and are there
fore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active mar kets for identical securities.  Equity-index 
futures are valued based on unadju sted prices in active markets  and are Level 1 assets .  
Real Assets
 
The real asset 
category includes portfo lios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infr astructure equities, and private real esta te funds.  The commodityfutures, 
global REITS , and global listed i nfrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  
Fixed-Income
 
Fixed-income 
  securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities , and other fixed-income s ecurities, includingcorporate debt securities. 
  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value isdetermined by observable 
market prices i n active markets.   A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2using evaluated pricing da
ta such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.   Significant inputs u sed in the valuation model g enerallyinclude benchmark yield 
curves and issuer spreads.   The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation model, asapplicable.

CONTINGENCIES
AND
COMMITMENTS
 
PG 
&E Corporation and the Utility have significant conting encies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigation matters and environmental remediation 
.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and th e amount of the loss canbe reasonably estimat
ed.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of therange, unless an amount within th
e ra nge is a better estim ate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, andwhether the loss or a range of 
loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencie s are reviewed quarter ly andestimates are adjus
ted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, andother information and ev
ents pertaining to a particular mat ter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Util ity’s policy is to exclude anticipated legal costs from the provisionfor loss and expense these costs 
as incurred.   The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection with agreements entered into to s upport its operating activities. 
  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation has financial co mmitments described in “Other Commitments” below.   PG&ECorporation’s and the Utility
’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcom e of the following matters.

Communication
Rules
During 2014 and 2015, the Utility filed s
everal reports to notify the CPUC of communications that the Utility believes may have constituted or described ex partecommunications that e
ither should not have occurred or that should have been timely report ed to the CPUC.  Ex parte communications include communicationsbetween a decision maker o
r a commissioner’s advisor and interested persons concerning substantive issues in certain formal proceedings.  Certain communicationsare prohibited and others 
are p ermissible with proper not icing and reporting. 
On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Uti
lity should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule 1.1of the CPUC’s Rules of Practice and Procedur
e governing the conduct of those app earing before the CPUC.  The OII cites some of the communications the Utilityreported to the CPUC.  The OII also cites 
the ex parte violations alleged in the City of San Bruno’s July 2014 motion, which it filed in CPUC i nvestigations related to the Utility’s natural g
as transmission pipeline operations and practices. 
On October 14, 2016, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, ORA, the SED, TURN, and the Utility sub
mitted a status report to the CPUC which proposed an update to the framework fo
r resolving the proceeding.  The revised f ramework includes a tota l of 164 communications in the scop e of the proceeding.  Throughout 2016, the parties jointly subm
itted stipulations on all of the communications, and on November 30, 2016, the parties began settlement discuss ions .  In the event asettlement c 
annot be reached, the par ties will brief the matt er based upon the ide ntified communicat ions and some related discove ry as well as factual st ipulationsand agreed upon issues of policy and 
law for CPUC resolution.  T he opening briefs are due on Ma rch 24, 2017, and reply briefs are due on April 14, 2017. 
The Utility expects 
that the other parti es may argue that the number of violations exceeds the 164 communications referenced in the October 14, 2016 joint statusreport either becaus
e a single communication may have violated more than one rule or because they believe some of the material provid ed during discoveryconstitutes impermiss
ible ex parte communications.  The Utility expects to contest many of these assertions.  If the matter does not settle, the CPUC will determinewhich communications includ
ed within the scope of th e proceeding were in viola tion of its rules.  The CPUC will also determine whether to impose penalties or otherremedies, as a result o
f a potential settlement or otherwise.  The CPUC can impose fines up to $50,000 for each violation, and up to $50,000 per day if the CPUC determines that the v
iolation was continuing.  The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, includingsuch factors as how many days each v
iolation continued; the gravity of t he violations; the type of h arm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected;and the good faith of the ent
ity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation.  The CPUC is also required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of 
the penalty to the size of the entity charged.  The CPUC has historically exercised broad discretion in determining whether violations arecontinuing and the amount of pen
alties to be imposed.  
132
 

 PG&E Corporation and the Utility b 
elieve it is probable that the CPUC will impose penal ties on the Utility in the OI I.  In light of recent CPUC decisions, such as thePenalty Decision and the decis
ion in the 2015 GT&S rate case, the Utility expects that such penalties could include fines a nd future revenue requir ement reductions. In accordance with accoun
ting rules, r evenue requirement r eductions would be recorded in the period they are incurred and fines would be re corded when consideredprobable and their amount o
r range can be reasonabl y estimated.  The Utility is unable to determine the form or amount of penalties or reasonably estimate theamount or range of future 
charges that could be incurred because it is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations.
 
Finally, 
in 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Franc isco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedlyimproper communicat
ion between the Utility and CPUC personnel.  Th e Utility has cooperated wi th those investigations.   It is uncertain whether any charges will bebrought against the Utility.

 Record-Keeping 
On November 20, 2014, the CPUC began an inves 
tigation into whether the Ut ility violated applicable laws pertaining to record-keeping practices with respect tomaintaining safe oper
ation of its natural gas distribution service and facilities.  The order also required the Utility to show cause why (1) the CPUC should not find that the Utility viola
ted provisions of the California Public Utilities Code, CPUC general orders or decisions, other rules, or requirements, and/or engaged inunreasonable and/or impr
udent practices related to these matters, and ( 2) the CPUC should not impose penalties, and/o r any other forms of relief, if any violations arefound.  In particular, the o
rder cited the SED’s investigative reports alleging that the Utility violated rules regarding safety record-keeping in connection w ith six natural gas distribution 
incidents, including the natural gas explosion that occurred in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014.   
On August 18, 2016, the CPUC approved a final decision in this 
investigation.  The CPUC assessed a fine of $25.6 million.  With the $10.85 mi llion citationpreviously paid in 2015 for the City o
f Carmel-by-the-Sea (“Carmel”) incident, the total fine imposed on the Utility was $36.5 million.  The remaining $25.6 millionwas paid in September 2016.  The decis
ion denied the appeals previously fi led by the SED and Carmel from the presiding officer’s decision, and closed thisproceeding but allowed the pa
rties an opportunity to request that this proceeding be reopened if needed to ensure proper implementation of a complian ce plan to be developed by the parties. 
 
On September 26, 2016, the SED filed an appli
cation for reh earing of the CPUC’s decision.  Specifi cally, the application indicates that the CPUC erred in certain ofits determinations (
including those related to m aximum all owable operating pressure documentation that, if adopted, could result in an add itional fine of $7 million),calculations (includ
ing those related to the missing De Anza records violations) and certain other findings, and requests that the CPU C a dopt its recommendations. On October 11, 2016, the Utility submi 
tted its response to the CPUC in which it opposed the SED’s application for rehearing arguing that the application failed toidentify a legal er
ror warranting rehearing by the CPUC.  The Util ity cannot predict when or if the C PUC will grant the rehearing or if it will ad opt the SED’s recommendations.
 
On October 24, 2016 and November 30 
, 2016, the Utility held meet and confer sessions with parties to develop re medial measures necessary to add ress the issues identified in the CPUC decision with th
e objective of establishing a compliance plan .  O n December 16, 2016 , the Utility submitted i ts Initial Gas DistributionRecords Compliance Plan that in
cludes feasible and cost-effective measure s neces sary to improve natural g as di stribution system record -keeping.  
Natural

Pipeline
Rights-of-Way


 
In 2012, the Utility notified 
the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address aself-reported viola
tion whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipelinerights-of-way. 
  The Utility also submitted a proposed compliance plan that s et forth the scope and timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachments over amulti-year period and 
to pay penalties if the proposed milestones were not met.   In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey had been completed and that remediation work, in
cluding removal of the encroachments, was expected to continue for several years. The SED has not addressed the Utility’s proposedcompliance plan, and it 
is reasonably possible that the SED will impose fines on the Utility in the futur e based on the Utility’s failure to continuously survey its systemand remove encroachmen
ts.  T he Utility is unable to re asonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given the SED’s widediscretion 
and the number of factors that can be considered in determining penalties. 
133
 

 Potential
Safety
Citations
 
The SED periodically audits uti
lity operating practices and conducts investigations of potential violations of laws and regulations applicable to the s afety of the California utilities’ electric and 
natural g as facilities and ope rations.  The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issu e citations and impose penalties for violations identified 
through audits, investigations, or self -reports.  Under bo th the gas and electri c programs, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty foreach violation, but if i
t assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000.  The SED may, at its discretion, imposepenalties on a daily basis, o
r on a less than daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one d ay.  The SED can consider the discre tionary factors discussedabove (see “Order Institu
ting an Investigation into Compliance with Ex Parte Communic ation Rules” above) in dete rmining the number of violations and whether toimpose daily fin 
es for continuing violations.  Th ere is also an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued. 
The SED has imposed fines on the Utility 
ranging from $50,0 00 to $16.8 million for violat ions of electric and natural gas laws and regulations.  The Utility believes itis probable that the SED will impos
e penalties or take other enforcement action based on some of the Utility’s self-reported non-compliance with l aws and regulations, based on the SED’s invest
igations of incidents reported to the CPUC, or based on allegations of non-compliance with such laws and regulations that arecontained in some of the SED’s audi
ts or investigations.  The Utility is unable to r easonably estimate th e amount or range of future charges that could be incurred forfines imposed by the SED with respect 
to these matters given the wide discretion the SED and other CPUC staff has in determining whether to bring enforcementaction and the 
number of factors that can be considered in determining the amount of fines. 
In September 2016, the Utility 
reported that it discovered in November 2015 that approximately 550,000 atmospheric corrosion inspections on above-ground gasdistribution meters 
completed in 2014, which constitu te d 35% of such inspections in 2014, were performed by non-operator qualified personnel.  The Utility did notprovide timely notifi
cation of su ch non-compliance to the CPUC.  On December 23, 2016, the SED issued the Utility a citation with a $5.45 mil lion fine related tothis self-report.  
The citation included a $5.05 million fine for not ensuring that contractor inspectors were operator-qualified, a $350,000 fine for not completinginspections within 39 months from 
the pre vious inspections, and a $50,000 fine fo r not reporting the self-identified violations within ten days of discovery.  The amount of the fine is condi
tioned upon the Utility implementing certain remedial measu res.  The Utility paid the fine in January 2017.  
In 
February 2017, the Utility reported th at it discovered in April 2014 that customer serv ice representatives who handle gas emergency calls within the Utility’s callcenters are not includ
ed in the drug and alcohol testing program as required by PHMSA r egulations.  The Utility did not provide ti mely notification of su ch non- compliance to the CPUC.  
The SED could impose fines on the Utili ty of $50,000 per violation , and also for failure to timely file a self-report in connection with the non-compliance 
.  The SED has the authority to issue more than one citation for a series of related incidents and can impose daily fines for continuing violations , and the CPUC can issue an OII and possible addition
al fines even after the SED has issued a citation.  The Uti lity is unable to reasonab ly estimate the amount or range offuture charges that cou
ld be incurred for fines that could be imposed with respect to this self-report, for the reasons indicated above, or to predict whether the CPUCwill open a formal proce
edi ng.  
Federal Matters
 
Federal
Criminal
Trial

On June 14, 2016, a federal crimin
al trial against the Utility began in the United States Distr ict Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, on 12felony counts alleging tha
t the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act relating to record- keeping, pipeline integr
ity management, and identification of pipeline threats, and one felony count charging that the Utility obstructed the NTSB investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accid
ent.  On July 26, 2016, the court granted the go vernment’s motion to dism iss one count alleging that the Util ity knowingly andwillfully failed to 
retain a strength tes t pressure record with respect to a distri bution feeder main , thereby reducing the tot al number of counts from 13 to 12.  
On August 9, 
2 016, the jury returned its verdict.  The jury acquitted the Utility on all six of the record-keeping allegations but found the Utility guilty on six felonycounts that include one count o
f obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violat ions of pipeline integrity managemen t regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline 
Safety Act.   
134
 

 On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgm
ent of conviction sentencing the Utility to a five-year corporate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with 
the ability to apply for earl y termination after three years,  a fine of $3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertisingrequirements, and commun
ity service.  The Utility has decided not to appeal the conviction s.  The probation includes a requ irement that the Utility not commit anylocal, state, or fede
ral crimes during the probation period.  As part of the probation, the Utility is required to retain a third-party monitor.  The goal of the monitorshipwill be t 
o prevent the crimina l conduct with respect to gas pipeline transmission safety that gave rise to the conviction.  To that end, the goal of the monitor will be tohelp ensure that the Util
ity takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of the gas transmission pipel ine system, performs appropriate integritymanagement assessments o
n its gas transmission pipelines, and maintains an effective ethics and compliance program and safety related incentive program. 
After an initial assess
ment is c onducted and an initial r eport is prepared by the monitor, the monitor will prepare reports on a semi-annual basis setting forth themonitor’s continued assessm
ent and making recommendations consistent with the goals and scope of the monitorship.  The Util ity expects that the mon itor will beretained before the 
end of the second quarter of 2017.  
At December 31, 2016, PG&E Corporation’s and the Ut
ility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a $3 million accrual in connection with this matter.  On February 1, 2017, the Utility paid the $3 mi
l lion fine imposed by the cour t.  The Utility could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the te
rms of probation and in connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to the monito r’s compensation or costs resulting fromrecommendations of the 
monitor). 
Other
Federal
Matters  
In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Franc
isco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matt ers related to all egedly impropercommunication between th
e Utility and CPUC personnel.  The Utility has cooperated with those investigations.   In addition, in October 2016, the Utility received agrand 
jury subpoena and letter f rom the U.S. Attorney for t he Northern District of Cali fornia advising that the Utility is a target of a federal investigation regardingpossible criminal viol
ations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and conspiracy to violate th e act.  The investigation involves a removal by the Util ity of a hazard ous tree that c 
ontained an osprey nest and egg in Inverness, California, on Ma rch 18, 2016.  It is uncertain wheth er any charges will be brought agains t the Utility as a result of these investig
ations.

Other Matters
Butte
Fire
Litigation
 
In September 2015, a wildfire 
(known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.  On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire  released its report o
f the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire.   According to Cal Fire’s report, the fire bu rned 70,868 acres, resulted in two fatalities,destroyed 
549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commercial properties , and damaged 44 structures .  Cal Fire’s   report conclu ded that the wildfire was c aused when a Gray Pine tree 
contacted   the Utility’s   electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility   and /or its vegetation management contractors 
, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc.,   to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation m anagement program ultimately led  to the failure ofthe tree. 
  In a press release also issued on April 28, 2016, Cal Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million from the Utility. 
On May 23, 2016, individual plain 
tiffs filed a master complaint agai nst the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of Californiafor Sacramento County. 
  Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.   The California Judic ial Council had previously autho rizedthe coordination of all 
cases in Sacramento County.   As of December 31, 2016, complaints have been fi led against the Utility and its two vegetation managementcontractors in the Supe 
rior Court of California in the Coun ties of Calaveras ,   San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador involving approximately 1,950 individual plaintiffs 
representing approxima tely 950 households and their insurance comp ani es.   These complaints are part of or are in the process of be ing added to the twomaster complaints. 
    Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on inverse condemnation and negligence theories of liability.  The number of individual complaints 
and plaint iffs may increase in the future.  
The Utility conti 
nues mediating and settl ing cases.  The next case managemen t conference is scheduled for March 2, 2017. 
 
136
 

 In connection with this mat
ter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest , and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through the theory of inverse condemnation.  In add
ition, the Utility may be liab le for fire suppression costs, persona l injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to h avebeen negligent.  The Utility b
elieves it was not negligent; however , there can be no assurance that a court or jury would agree with the Utility.  The Utility believesthat it is probable tha
t it will incur a loss of at least $750 million for all potential damages described above.  This amount is based on assumptions abou t the number, size, and type of structur
es damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures, the number and types of tre es damaged or destroyed, as well as assumptions aboutpersonal injury damages, a
ttorneys’ fees, fire suppression costs, and other d amages that the Utili ty could be liable for under the theories of inverse condemnationand/or negligence.
 
The following table present 
s changes in the third-party claims liability since December 31, 2015.  The balance fo r the third-party claims liability is included in O ther current liabilities

In 
add ition to the amounts reflected in the table above, the Utility has incur red c umulative legal expens es of $27 million.  
The Utility believes tha
t it is reasonably possible that it will incur losses related to Butte fire claims in excess of $750 million accrued through December 31, 2016 but is currently unable to r
easonably estimate the upper end of the range of losses because it is still in an early stage of the evaluation of claims, the mediation andsettlement process, and d
iscovery.  The process for e stimating costs associated  with claims relating to the Butte fire requires management to exercise significantjudgment based on a number of assu
mptions and subjective factors.  As more information becomes known, including additional discovery from the plai ntiffs and results from the ongoi
ng mediation and settlement process, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Butte fire may result inmaterial incre
ases to the loss accrued.  
The Utility has liabili
ty insurance from va rious insurers, which provides cove rage for third-party liability attributable to the Butte fire in an aggregate amount ofapproximately $900 mill
ion.  The Utility records insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that a recovery will occur and the U tility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  The Ut
ility has recorded $625 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with losses related to the Butte fire.  While the Utilityplans to seek recovery of a
ll insured losses, it is una ble to predict the ult imate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.  In addition, the Utility is pursuingcoverage under the insuran
ce policies of its two vegetation management contractors, including under policies where the Utility is listed as an additional insured. Recoveries of any amounts under 
these policies are uncertain. 
The following table presents 
changes in the insurance receivable since December 31, 2015.  The balance for the insurance receivable is included in Other accountsreceivab

’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially aff ected in the reporting periods during which additionalcharges are recorded, d
epending on whether the Utility is able to record or collect insurance recoveries in amounts sufficient to offset such additional accruals.

 Other
Contingencies
 
PG&E 
Corporation and the Utility a re subject to various claims, lawsuits and regulatory proceeding s that separately are not considered material .  Accruals for contingencies relat
ed to such matters (excluding amounts related to the contingencies discussed a bove under “Enforcement and L itigation Matters” ) totaled $45 million at 
December 31, 2016 and $63 million at Decembe r 31, 2015.  These amounts are includ ed in O ther current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The resolution of these ma
tters is not expected to have a ma terial impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows. 
 
Disallowance

PG&E Corporation and the Utility re
cord a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not berecoverable through ra
tes and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  Capital disallowances are reflected in operating and mainten ance expenses inthe Consolida 
ted Statements of Income .  Disallowances as a result of the CPUC’s June 23, 2016 final phase one decision and December 1, 2016 final phase twodecision 
in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate c ase , the April 9, 2015 Penalty Decision and th e Utility’s Pipeline Safe ty Enhancement Plan are dis cussed below.

On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved

capital spending in excess o f the am ount adopted and established va rious cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the current rate casecycle, including new one-way cap
ital balancing accounts.  As a result, in 2016, the Uti lity incurred charges of $219 million for capital expenditure s that the Utilitybelieves are probable o
f disallowance based on the decision.  This included $134 million to the net plant balance for 2011 through 2014 capital expend itures in e xcess of adopted 
amounts and $85 million for the Utili ty’s estimate of 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that are probable of exceeding authoriz ed amounts. Additional charges may be r
equired in the future based on the Utility’s ability to manage its capital spending and on the outcome of the CPUC’s audit of 2011 th rough2014 capital spending.

On Ap

that the Utility had committed numerous violations of laws and regulations related to its natural gas transmission operations (the “Penalty Decision”) . 
In January 2016, the CPUC closed the investigative proceedings.  The total penalty includes (1) a $300 million fine, (2) a one-time $400 million b ill credit to theUtility’s natural gas cus
tomers, (3) $850 million to fund pipeline safety proje cts and progr ams, and (4) remedial measures that the CPUC estimates will cost theUtility at least $50 mi

On December 1 
, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase two decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S r ate case , which applies $689 million of the $850 million p ena ltyto capital expenditures.

The Penalty Decision disallows the Utility from recovering $850 million in costs associated with pipeline safety-related projects and programs .  On December 1, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase two decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT& 
S rate case which allocates $689 million of the $850 mill ion penalty to capital expenditures.(2 
) GT&S revenues have been reduced for these unrecovered expenses. The remaining charges will be recognized in the first quarter of 2017. (3 
) In the Penalty De cision, the CPUC estimated that the Uti lity would incur $50 million to comply with the remedies spec ified in the Penalty Decision.  This table does not reflect the Uti lity’sremedy-related costs already incurred or the Utility’s estimated future remedy-rel 
ated costs.

f which $665 million was expensed in previous years for costs th at are expected t o exceed the authorized amount.  The Utility expects theremaining PSEP 
work to co ntinue beyond 2 017.  The Utility would be required to record charges in future periods to the extent PSEP-related capital costs are higherthan currently expected.

 Environm
ental
Remediation
Contingencies  
Given the complexities of 
the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncerta inties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process forestimating remediation liabilities is
 subjective and requires significant judgment.   The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the siteassessments indicate th
at remediation is probable and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts.  The Utility records an environmental remed
iation liability based on the lower end of the range of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the rang e is a better estimate than anyother amount. 
  Amounts recorded are not discounted to their present value.  The Utility’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-currentliabilities on the Consolid
a ted Balance Sheets and is compos ed of the following:

See “Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites” below. 
The Utility’s gas compressor s
tations, former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, and disposal of pot
entially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the EPA under the federal Resource Conversation and Recovery Actas well as other state ha
zardous waste laws.  The Utility has a com prehensive program in pla ce designed to comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulationsrelated to hazardous materials,
 waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility assesses and monito rs, on an ongoing basis, measures that may be necessary to 
comply with these laws and regulations and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate.   The Utility’s remedia tion activitiesare overseen by the 
DTSC , several California r egional water quality control boards, and various other federal , state, and local agencies. 
The Utility’s environment
al remediation liability at December 31, 2016 reflects its best estimate of pr obable future costs associated with its final remediati on plan. Future costs will depend on many fa
ctors, including the extent of work to implement final remediation plans and the Utility’s required time frame for remediation. Future changes in cost estim
ates and the assumptions on which they are based may h ave a material i mpact on future financial condition and cash flows. 
At 
December 31, 2016 the Utility expected to recover $ 671 million of its environmental remediation liability through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized bythe CPUC.  One of these mechanisms allows the Ut
ility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved s ites (including the Topock site) without a reasonab
leness review.  T he Utility may incur environmental remediation costs that it does not seek to recover in rates, such as the co sts associated with the Hinkley si
te. 
Natural Gas Compressor 
Station Sites  
T 
he Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural g as compressorstations.  One of these stations 
is located near Needles, California and is r eferred to below as the “Topock site.”  Another st ation is located near Hinkley, Californiaand is referred to below as 
the “Hinkley site.”  The Utility is also requir ed to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment. 
140
 

 Topock
Site
 
The Utili 
ty’s remediation and ab atement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the DTSC and the DOI.  In November 2015, the Utility submitted its final r
emediation design to the agencies for approval.  The Utility’s design proposes tha t the Utility construct an in-situ groundwater treatment system toconvert hexavalent chro
mium into a non-toxic and non-soluble form of chromium.  The DTSC conducted an additional environmental review of the proposed designand issued a draft environm
ental impact report for publ ic comment in January 2017.  After the DTSC considers public comments that may be made, the DTSC isexpected to issue a fina
l environmental impact report in mid-2017. After the Utility modifies its design in response to the final rep ort, the Utility will seek approval tobegin construction of the new in
-situ treatment system in late 2017 or early 2018. 
Hinkley
Site
 
The Utility has been imple
menting interim remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium p lume and to monitor and cont rol movementof the plume.  The Utility’s 
remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the Regional Board.  In November 2015, theRegional Board adopted a final 
clean-up and ab atement order to cont ain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potentialenvironmental impacts.  T
he final order states that the Utility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium p lume, and take other action.  Addition
ally, the final order requires setting plume capture requirements, requires establishing a monitoring and reporting program, and finalizesdeadlines for the Utility
 to meet interim cleanup targets. 
Reasonably Possible 
Environmental Contingencies  
Although the Utility has provided fo
r known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the Utility’s undiscounted fu ture costs couldincrease to as much as $ 
1.9 billion (including amounts rela ted to the Topock and Hinkley sites described abov e ) if the extent of cont amination or necessaryremediation is greater than antici
pated or if the other potentially re sponsible parties are not financially ab le to contribute to thes e costs .   The Utility may incur actualcosts in the future that
 are materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations, financial cond ition and cash flows during the period in which they 
are recorded. 
Nuclear
Insurance
 
The Utility is a member o
f NEIL, which is a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities.  NEIL provides insurance coverage for p roperty damages andbusine 
ss interruption losses incur red by the Utility if a nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s two nucle ar generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retiredHumboldt Bay Unit 3. 
NEIL provides property damage and bus iness interruption coverage of up to $ 3.2 billion per nuclear incident and $2.6 billion per non-nuclear incident 
for Diablo Canyon .  Humboldt Bay Unit 3 has up to $ 131 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nucl ear property damages.  
NEIL also provide 
s coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants.  Certain acts of terro rism may be “certified” by the Secretary of theTreasury.  If damages ar
e caused by certified acts of terrorism, NEIL can obtain compensation f rom the federal government and will provide up to its full policy limitof $ 
3.2 billion for each insured loss.  In contrast, NEIL would treat all non-certified terrorist acts occurring within a 12-month period against one or more c ommercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL 
as one event and the owners of the affected plants would share the $ 3.2 billion policy limit amount.  
In addition to the nuclea
r insurance the Utility maintains through the   NEIL, the Utility also is a member of the   EMANI, which provides excess insurance coveragefor property damages and busin
ess interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon.   
If NEIL losses in any policy year 
exceed accumulated f unds, the Utility could be subjec t to a retrospective assessment.     If NEIL were to exercise this assessment, asof December 31, 2016, the curren
t maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $60 million.     EMANIprovides $200 million for any one 
accident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amount recoverable under the Utility’s NEIL policies.  If EMANIlosses in any policy year exc
eed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retro spective assessment of app roximately $2 million, as of December 31, 2016.    
  
141
 

 Under the Price-Anderson Act, public 
liability claims that arise from nuclear incid ents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation ofmaterial to and f 
rom Diablo Canyon are limit ed to $ 13.5 billion.  The Utility purchas ed the maximum available public liability insurance of $ 375 million for DiabloCanyon.  Th 
e balance of the $ 13.5 billion of liability p rotection is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclear reactors.  The Utility maybe assessed up to $ 
255 million per nuclear incident under this program, with payments in each year lim ited to a m aximum of $38 million per incident.  Both themaximum assessment and th
e maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.  The next scheduled adjustment is due on or beforeSeptember 10, 2018 
.  
The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to 
claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to afuel fabricator or that occur at 
the fuel fabricato r’s facility.  The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidents upto a maximum of $ 
375 million per incident.   In addition, the Utility has $ 53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a $ 500 millionindemnification fro
m the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents, covering l iabilities in excess o f the lia bility insurance. 142

Chapter
11
Disputed
Claims
 
Various electricity supp
liers filed claims in the Utility’s proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energy suppl ied to the Utility’s customers betwe
en May 2000 and June 2001.   While the FERC and judicial proceedings are pending, the Utility has pursued, and continues to pursue, settlements with ele
ctricity suppliers.  The Utility has entered in to a number of settlem ent agreements with var ious electricity suppliers to resolve some of thesedisputed claims and to reso
lve the Utility’s refund claims agains t these electricity suppliers. Under these settlement agreements, a mounts payable by the parti es are,in some insta 
nces, subject to adjustmen t based on the outcome of the various refund offset and interest issues being considered by the FER C.  In connection with the CPUC approved settlement agreem
ent, on April 12, 2004, the Utility deposited approximately $1.7 billion into escrow for the payment o f certain disputed claims,previously collected f
rom customers through rates.  Generally, any net refunds, claim offsets, or other credits that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers eitherthrough settlement or th
roug h the conclusion of the various FERC and judi cial proceedings are refunded to customers through rates in future periods. 
On October 13, 2016, the Utility rece
ived approval from the bankruptcy court to release the remaining cash held in escrow to unrestric ted cash for use by the Utili ty. The approval resulted in a $ 
161 million reduction to the cash in escrow within the Restricted cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
On September 2, 2016, the Utility’s se
ttlement becam e effective resolv ing, among other matters, the Utility’s claim against the CAISO for $ 165 million, whichincludes receivables 
and interest.   Additionally, the Utility agreed to release $ 66 million of cas h from escrow to the Californ ia Power Exchange.  The settlementresulted in a $ 
231 million reduction to the Disputed claims and customer refunds balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.     
At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, r
espectively, the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $ 236 million and $ 454 million in net claims within Disputedclaims and customer r
efunds.  The cash held in escrow within Restricted cash was zero as of December 31, 2016 and $ 228 million as of December 31, 2015. TheUtility is uncertain when or how t 
he remaining net disputed claims liability will be resolved. 143

includes those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable ass urance that transac tions are recorded as necessary to permitpreparation of financ
ial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations ofmanagement and direc
tors of PG&E Corporatio n and the Utility, and (3) provid e reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or
 disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

We have audited the int

ing.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company ’ s and the Utility ’ s internal control over financialreporting based on our audits.
 
We conducted our 
audit s in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we planand perform the audit 
s to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial re porting was maintained  in all material respects. Ouraudit 
s included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating thedesign and operating effe
ctiveness of internal control bas ed on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company 
’ s internal control over financial repor ting is a process designed by, or unde r the supervision of, the company ’ s principal executive and principalfinancial office
rs, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company ’ s board of directors, management, and other personnel to pr ovide reasonable assurance regardi
ng the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting pr
inciples. A company ’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and p rocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance ofrecords that, in reasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransacti 
ons are recorded as nece ssary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts andexpenditures of the company 
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management a nd directors of the company ; and (3) provide reasonableassurance regarding prev
ention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company ’ s assets that could have a material effect on thefinancial statements.
 
Because of 
the inherent limitations of i nternal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,material missta
tements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also , projections of any evalua tion of the effectiveness of the internalcontrol over financia
l reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with 
the policies or procedur es may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, the Company and the Util
ity maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , bas ed on the criteria established in

December 31, 2016 . These financial stat ements are the r esponsibility of the Company ’ s and the Utility ’ s management. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on these finan
cial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standa rds require that we planand perform the audit to ob
tain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a testbasis, evidence supporting th 
e amounts and disclosures in th e financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significantestimates made by management,
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our aud its provide a reasonable b asis for ouropinion.
 
In our opinion, such consolidated f
inancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries and ofPacific Gas and Electri
c Company and subsid iaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the results of their op erations and their cash flows for each of the t hree years in the period ended Dec

Corporation's form of proxy and ballot, by any Eligible Shareholder (as defined in Section 3(c)(i) below) or group of up to 20 Eligible Shareholders that, asdetermined by the Board of Dir
ectors or its designee acting in good faith, has (individually and collectively, in the case of a group) satisfied all applicable conditionsand complied with all appl

t number of directors constituting 20 percent of the total number of directors of the Corporation on the last day on which a NominationNotice may be submitted pursu

e Secretary of the Corporation, within the time period referred to in Section 3(d), evidence of continuous ownership of such shares forsuch three-year period 
from one or more securities intermediaries in a form that the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, determines acceptable.(ii) 
    An Eligible Shareholder or group of up to 20 Eligible Shareholders may submit a nomination in accordance withthis Section 3 only if the person o
r group (in the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined in Section 3(c)(iii) below) (as adjustedfor any stock splits, revers
e stock splits, stock dividends or similar events) of shares of the Corporation's common stock throughout the three-year period precedingand including the date of subm
ission of the Nomination Notice, and continues to own at least the Minimum Number of shares through the date of the annual meetingof shareholders. The following sha
ll be treated as one Eligible Shareholder if such Eligible Shareholder shall provide together with the Nomination Noticedocumentation satisfa
ctory to the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, that demonstrates compliance with the following criteria: (1) funds undercommon management and inv
estment control; (2) funds under common management and funded primarily by the same employer; or (3) a "family of investmentcompanies" or a "group of invest
ment companies" (each as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event ofa nomination by a Nominating Shar
eholder that includes more than one Eligible Shareholder, any and all requirements and obligations for a given EligibleShareholder or, except as th
e context otherwise makes clear, the Nominating Shareholder that are set forth in this Section 3, including the minimum holding period,shall apply to each memb
er of such group; provided, however, that the Minimum Number shall apply to the aggregate ownership of the group of Eligible Shareholdersconstituting the Nominating Sha
reholder.  Should any Eligible Shareholder withdraw from a group of Eligible Shareholders constituting a Nominating Shareholder atany time prior to the annu
al meeting of shareholders, the Nominating Shareholder shall be deemed to own only the shares held by the remaining Eligible Shareholders.As used in this Section 3, any refer
ence to a "group" or "group of Eligible Shareholders" refers to any Nominating Shareholder that consists of more than one EligibleShareholder and to all the E
ligible Shareholders that make up such Nominating Shareholder.(iii) 
    The "Minimum Number" of shares of the Corporation's common stock means 3 percent of the number ofoutstanding shares of common sto
ck of the Corporation as of the most recent date for which such amount is given in any filing by the Corporation with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission prior to th
e submission of the Nomination Notice.(iv) 
    For purposes of this Section 3, an Eligible Shareholder "owns" only those outstanding shares of the Corporation'scommon stock as to which such Eligib
le Shareholder possesses both: (1) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to such shares and (2) the full economicinterest in (including 
the opportunity for profit from and the risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (1)and (2) shall not include any sh
ares (x) sold by such Eligible Shareholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (y) borrowed bysuch Eligible Shareholder or 
any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such Eligible Shareholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or(z) subject to any option, war
rant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, or other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such Eligible Shareholder or any ofits affiliates, wheth
er any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding capital stock ofthe Corporation, in any such case whi
ch instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of: (A) reducing in any manner, to any extent or atany time in the future, su
ch Eligible Shareholder's or any of its affiliates' full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (B) hedging, offsetting, oraltering to any degree 
any gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such Eligible Shareholder or any of its affiliates. An EligibleShareholder "owns" shares held in the n
ame of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Shareholder retains the right to instruct how the shares arevoted with respect to the e
lection of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. An Eligible Shareholder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to
continue during any period in which the Eligible Shareholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other similar instrument orarrangement that is 
revocable at any time by the Eligible Shareholder.  An Eligible Shareholder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period inwhich the Eligible Shareholde
r has loaned such shares, provided that the Eligible Shareholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on not more than fivebusiness days' notice. The terms "owned," "owning," 
and other variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings.  Whether outstanding shares of theCorporation are "owned" for these pu
rposes shall be determined by the Board of Directors or its designee acting in good faith.  For purposes of this Section 3(c)(iv),the term "affili
ate" or "affiliates" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, asamended ("Exchange Act").
(v) 
    No Eligible Shareholder shall be permitted to be in more than one group constituting a Nominating Shareholder,and if any Eligible Sharehold
er appears as a member of more than one group, such Eligible Shareholder shall be deemed to be a member of only the group that has thelargest ownership position as r
eflected in the Nomination Notice.(d)

t. 
If the Restricted Stock Units

e Change in Control and be settled in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule, subject to theearlier settlement provisions 
of this Agreement.

 extent they did not previously vest upon, for example, failure of the Acquiror to assume or continuethis
 award) will vest on the date of such separation and will be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60)days
 after)  the  date  of  such  separation.   PG&E  Corporation  has  the  sole  discretion  to  determine  whether  termination  of  youremployment was made in conne

 of your "separation from service" under Section 409A (or shorter period ending on the date of your death following suchseparation) will inste
ad be issued on the first business day following the expiration of the applicable delay period. 
Withholding
Taxes
The  number  of  shares  of  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock  that  you  are  otherwise  entitled  to  receive  upon  settlement  ofRestricted
 Stock Units will be reduced by a number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG&ECorporation,
 equal  to  the  amount  of  any  Federal,  state,  or  local  taxes  of  any  kind  required  by  law  to  be  withheld  by  PG&ECorporation 
in connection  with the Restricted Stock Units determined using the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates , including 
social  security  and  Medicare  taxes  due  under  the  Federal  Insurance  Contributions  Act  and  the  California  StateDisability
 Insurance tax (" Withholding Taxes").   If the withheld shares  were not sufficient to satisfy your minimum WithholdingTaxes,

 upon  the  expiration  of  your  leave  of  absence  or  the  expiration  of  your  PG&E  Corporation  sponsored  disabilitybenefits, you will be consider
ed to have voluntarily terminated your employment.  See above under "Voluntary Termination." 
Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service upon expiration of suchleave
 is not guaranteed by statute or contract, then you will be deemed to have had a "separation from service" for purposes ofany Restricted
 Stock Units that are settled hereunder upon such separation.  To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due toa
 medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous periodof
 at least six (6) months and such impairment causes you to be unable to perform the duties of your position of employment orany substantially simil
ar position of employment, the six (6) month period in the prior sentence will be twenty-nine (29) months.

As  long  as  you  remain  employed  with  PG&E  Corporation,  the  Performance  Shares  will  vest  upon,  and  to  the  extent  of,  theCommittee's
 certification of the extent to which performance goals have been attained for this award, which certification will occuron
 or after January 1 but before March 15 of the third year following the calendar year of grant specified in the cover sheet (the"Vesting Date").
  Except as described below, all Performance Shares that have not vested will be cancelled upon termination of youremployment.
 
Vested
 Performance Shares will be settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction of WithholdingTaxes,
 as described below. The number of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplying the number of vestedPerformance
 Shares by the "rounded payout percentage" determined as follows (except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement),rounded to the nearest whole numb
er: 
Upon  the Vesting Date, PG&E Corporation's total shareholder return ("TSR") will be compared to the TSR of the fourteen othercompanies
 in PG&E Corporation's comparator group 1 for the prior three calendar years, consisting of 2016, 2017, and 2018 (the"Performance
 Period"). 1   Subject to rounding considerations, if PG&E Corporation's TSR falls below the 25 th percentile of thecomparator group the
 payout percentage will be 0%; if PG&E Corporation's TSR is at the 25 th percentile, the payout percentage willbe
 25%; if PG&E Corporation's TSR is at the 60 th percentile, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if PG&E Corporation's TSRis
 in the 90 th percentile or higher, the payout percentage will be 200%.  If PG&E Corporation's TSR performance is between the 25th 
percentile and the target, or between the target and the 90 th percentile, the rounded payout percentage is determined by straight-line
 interpolation  between  the  performance  percentile  associated  with  each  comparator  rank  and  between  the  rounded  payoutsassociated
 with each performance percentile (including the 25 th , 60 th , and 90 th percentiles) as shown in above table, roundeddown to the nearest whole number.  The following table sets forth the rounded pay

The payout percentage, if any, will be determined as soon as practicable following the date that the Committee (or a subcommittee of
that
 Committee)  or  an  equivalent  body  certifies  the  extent  to  which  performance  goals  have  been  attained,  pursuant  to  Section10.5(a)
 of the LTIP.  PG&E Corporation will issue shares as soon as practicable after such determination, but no earlier than theVesting Date, and not later th

The current Performance Comparator Group consists of the following companies:  Ameren Corporation, American Electric
Power, CMS Energy, Consolidated Edison, Inc., DTE Energy, Duke Energy, Edison International, Eversource Energy, NiSource,Inc., Pinnacle West Capita
l, SCANA Corp., Southern Company, Wisconsin Energy Corporation, and Xcel Energy, Inc.  PG&ECorporation reserves the r
ight to change the companies comprising the comparator group and the resulting payout percentage table inaccordance with the rul
es established by PG&E Corporation in connection with this award. 
(2) 
PG&E Corporation's TSR performance is measured by the value of stock price appreciation and dividends paid and reinvested,relative to compani
es in the Performance Comparator Group.  For these purposes, average share price will be measured bycomparing the average p
er share closing price of PG&E Corporation common stock during the 20 trading days before the beginningand the end of the Performan
ce Period. 
Dividends
Each  time that PG&E Corporation declares a dividend on its shares of common stock, an amount equal to the dividend multiplied bythe
 number of Performance Shares granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf.  If you receive a PerformanceShare
 settlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph, at that same time you also will receive a cash payment equal to theamount
 of  any  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  your  Performance  Shares  over  the  Performance  Period  multiplied  by  the  samepayout percentage used to de
termine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any. 
Voluntary
Termination
If you terminate  your employment with PG&E Corporation voluntarily before the Vesting Date (other than for Retirement), all of thePerformance
 Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your PerformanceShares will be forfeited.
 
Termination
for
Cause
If  your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG&E Corporation for cause before the Vesting Date, allof
 the  Performance  Shares  will  be  cancelled  as  of  the  date  of  such  termination  and  any  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  yourPerformance Shares will be 
forfeited. 
For
 these  purposes,  "cause"  means  when  PG&E  Corporation,  acting  in  good  faith  based  upon  information  then  known  to  it,determines
 that you have engaged in, committed, or are responsible  for, (1) serious misconduct,  gross negligence, theft, or fraudagainst
 PG&E  Corporation  and/or  its  affiliates,  (2)  refusal  or  unwillingness  to  perform  your  duties;  (3)  inappropriate  conduct  inviolation

 disparaging  of,  PG&E  Corporation,  its  Board  of  Directors,  Officers,  or  employees,  or  its  affiliates  or  subsidiaries;  (5)insubordination;
 (6) any willful act that is likely to have the effect of injuring the reputation, business, or business relationships ofPG&E Corporation or its subsidiaries o
r affiliates; (7) violation of any fiduciary duty; or (8) breach of any duty of loyalty.Termination
other
than
for
Cause
Upon your termination (other than termination for cause, voluntary termination, Retirement, termination due to death or Disability,or
 termination  in  connection  with  a  Change  in  Control)  the  number  of  vested  Performance  Shares  will  equal  the  number  ofPerformance
 Shares  subject  to  this  Agreement,  multiplied  by  the  number  of  your  days  of  service  with  PG&E  Corporation  in  thevesting
 period (through the date of termination), divided by the potential number of days of service in the vesting period.  All otheroutstanding
 Performance  Shares   will  be  cancelled,  and  any  associated  accrued  dividends  forfeited,  upon  such  termination.  Yourvested
 Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of theyear following completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees. At that time
you
 also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect toyour vested Performance Shares multiplied
 by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled toreceive, if any.
 
Retirement
If  you retire before the Vesting Date, your outstanding Performance Shares will continue to vest as though your employment hadcontinued
 and will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the yearfollowing
 completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applicable to active employees.  At that timeyou
 also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect toyour
 Performance  Shares  multiplied  by  the  same  payout  percentage  used  to  determine  the  number  of  shares  you  are  entitled  toreceive,
 if  any.    Your  termination  of  employment  will  be  considered  a  Retirement  if  you  are  age  55  or  older  on  the  date  oftermination
 (other than termination for cause) and if you were employed by PG&E Corporation for at least five consecutive yearsending on the date of term
ination of your employment. 
Death/Disability
If  your employment  terminates  due to your death or disability  before the Vesting Date, all of your Performance  Shares will vestimmediately
 and  will  be  settled,  if  at  all,  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  Vesting  Date  and  no  later  than  March  15  of  the  yearfollowing completion of
 the Performance Period based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees.  At that time youalso
 will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to yourPerformance
 Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, ifany.
 
Termination
Due
to
Disposition
of
Subsidiary
If your employment is terminated (other than for cause, your voluntary termination, or Retirement) (1) by reason of a divestiture orchange
 in control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longerqualifying as a subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue C
ode of 1986, as amended, or (2) coincident withthe
 sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, then your outstanding Performance Shares willvest and be settled in the s
ame manner as for a "Termination other than for Cause" described above. 
Change
in
Control
In the  event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parentthereof,
 as the case may be (the "Acquiror "
 ), may, without your consent, either assume or continue PG&E Corporation's rights andobligations
 under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subject tothis Agreement.
 
If
 the Acquiror assumes or continues PG&E Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitutes a substantially
equivalent award, TSR will be calculated by combining (a) the TSR of PG&E Corporation for the period from January 1 of the yearof
 grant to the date of the Change in Control, and (b) the TSR of the Acquiror from the date of the Change in Control to the last dayof
 the Performance Period.   The number of shares, if any, you are entitled to receive upon settlement of the assumed, continued orsubstituted
 Performance  Share  award  will  be  determined  based  on  the  rounded  payout  percentage  reflected  in  the  table  set  forthabove for the highest percentile TSR performance met or exceeded when calculated on that basis, and considering any adjustments to
the
 comparator group. Settlement will occur as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the yearfollowing
 completion of the Performance Period.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount ofdividends
 accrued with respect to your Performance Shares over the Performance Period multiplied by the same payout percentageused to determine the numb
er of shares you are entitled to receive, if any. 
If the Change in Control of PG&E Corporation occurs bef
ore the Vesting Date, and if this award is neither assumed nor continued bythe
 Acquiror or if the Acquiror does not provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subjectto
 this Agreement, all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest and become nonforfeitable on the date of the Change inControl.
  Such vested Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable following the original Vesting Date and nolater
 than March 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period.  The payout percentage, if any, will be based onTSR
 for  the  period  from  January  1  of  the  year  of  grant  to  the  date  of  the  Change  in  Control  compared  to  the  TSR  of  the  othercompanies
 in PG&E Corporation's comparator group for the same period. At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any,equal to
 the amount of dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares to the date of the Change in Control multiplied bythe same payout percent
age used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any.

Performance
Goals
As  long  as  you  remain  employed  with  PG&E  Corporation,  the  Performance  Shares  will  vest  upon,  and  to  the  extent  of,  theCommittee's
 certification of the extent to which performance goals have been attained for this award, which certification will occuron
 or after January 1 but before March 15 of the third year following the calendar year of grant specified in the cover sheet (the"Vesting Date").
  Except as described below, all Performance Shares that have not vested will be cancelled upon termination of youremployment.
 
Vested
 Performance Shares will be settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction of WithholdingTaxes,
 as described below. The number of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplying the number of vestedPerformance
 Shares by the "payout percentage" determined as follows (except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement), rounded tothe nearest whole number:
 
Fifty  percent of the Performance Shares have a safety performance goal and resulting safety payout percentage, and the other fiftypercent
 of the Performance Shares have an affordability performance goal and resulting affordability payout percentage.  Subject torounding
 considerations, in each case, if performance is below threshold,  the payout percentage will be 0%; if performance is atthreshold,
 the payout percentage will be 25%; if performance is at target, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if performance isat
 or better than maximum, the payout percentage will be 200%.  The actual payout percentage for performance between thresholdand maximum will
 be determined based on linear interpolation between the payout percentages for threshold and target, or target andmaximum, as appropriate.
The measures and goals are d
iscussed in more detail below: 
Safety 
-  At  the  end  of  2018,  PG&E  Corporation's  lost  workday  ("LWD")  case  rate  ("LWD  Rate")  for  that  year  will  bemeasured
 as the number of LWD cases incurred per 200,000 hours worked during 2018. LWD cases will be measured inthe same manner
 as for the 2016 Short-Term Incentive Plan, will include OSHA recordable incidents that result in loss of atleast
 one workday, and will exclude fatalities.  Threshold performance is 0.247, target performance is 0.215, and maximumperformance is 0.201.
 
Affordability 
-
 PG&E  Corporation's  affordability  performance  will  be  measured  as  the  reduction  in  standard  rate  caseexpense
 for unitized work and support operations and maintenance costs over the three calendar years prior to the normalVesting
 Date (the "Performance Period"), as compared to escalated actual costs in these areas for 2014 escalated by twoyears (at 2.75 percent pe
r year), as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, in accordance with the terms adoptedby
 the Committee at its February 16, 2016 meeting.   Threshold performance  is $75 million,  target performance  is $100million, and maximum pe
rformance is $200 million. 
The
 final  payout  percentages,  if  any,  will  be  determined  as  soon  as  practicable  following  the  date  that  the  Committee  (or  asubcommittee
 of  that  Committee)  or  an  equivalent  body  certifies  the  extent  to  which  the  performance  goals  have  been  attained,pursuant
 to Section 10.5(a) of the LTIP.  PG&E Corporation will issue shares as soon as practicable after such determination, but noearlier than the Vest
ing Date, and not later than March 15 of the calendar year following completion of the Performance Period. 
Dividends
Each  time that PG&E Corporation declares a dividend on its shares of common stock, an amount equal to the dividend multiplied bythe
 number of Performance Shares granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf.  If you receive a PerformanceShare
 settlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph, at that same time you also will receive a cash payment equal to theamount
 of  any  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  your  Performance  Shares  over  the  Performance  Period  multiplied  by  the  samepayout percentage used to de
termine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any. 
Voluntary
Termination
If you terminate  your employment with PG&E Corporation voluntarily before the Vesting Date (other than for Retirement), all of thePerformance
 Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your PerformanceShares will be forfeited.
 
Termination
for
Cause
If  your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG&E Corporation for cause before the Vesting Date, allof
 the  Performance  Shares  will  be  cancelled  as  of  the  date  of  such  termination  and  any  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  yourPerformance Shares will be 
forfeited.
 For
 these  purposes,  "cause"  means  when  PG&E  Corporation,  acting  in  good  faith  based  upon  information  then  known  to  it,determines
 that you have engaged in, committed, or are responsible  for, (1) serious misconduct,  gross negligence, theft, or fraudagainst
 PG&E  Corporation  and/or  its  affiliates,  (2)  refusal  or  unwillingness  to  perform  your  duties;  (3)  inappropriate  conduct  inviolation

 subject  to  this  Agreement,  multiplied  by  the  number  of  your  days  of  service  with  PG&E  Corporation  in  the  vesting  period(through
 the  date  of  termination),  divided  by  the  potential  number  of  days  of  service  in  the  vesting  period.   All  other  outstandingPerformance
 Shares   will  be  cancelled,  and  associated  accrued  dividends  will  be  forfeited,  upon  such  termination.  Your  vestedPerformance
 Shares  will  be  settled,  if  at  all,  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  Vesting  Date  and  no  later  than  March  15  of  the  yearfollowing
 completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees. At that time youalso
 will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to yourvested
 Performance  Shares  multiplied  by  the  same  payout  percentage  used  to  determine  the  number  of  shares  you  are  entitled  toreceive, if any.
 
Retirement
If  you  retire  before  the  Vesting  Date,  your  outstanding  Performance  Shares  will  continue  to  vest  as  though  your  employment  hadcontinued
 and  will  be  settled,  if  at  all,  as  soon  as  practicable  following  the  Vesting  Date  and  no  later  than  March  15  of  the  yearfollowing
 completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applicable to active employees.  At that timeyou
 also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect toyour
 Performance Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive,if

loyment.

Subsidiary
If your employment is terminated (other than for cause, your voluntary termination, or Retirement) (1) by reason of a divestiture orchange
 in control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longerqualifying
 as a subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (2) coincident withthe
 sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, then your outstanding Performance Shares willvest and be settled in the s
ame manner as for a "Termination other than for Cause" described above.

 as the case may be (the "Acquiror "
 ), may, without your consent, either assume or continue PG&E Corporation's rights andobligations
 under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subject to thisAgreement.
If

 in a payout percentage of 100%.  Settlement will occur as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March15
 of the year following completion of the Performance Period.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to theamount
 of dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares over the Performance Period multiplied by a payout percentageof 100%.

 all of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest and become nonforfeitable on the date of the Change in Control. Such
 vested Performance Shares will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable following the original Vesting Date and no later thanMarch
 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period.  Performance will be deemed to have been achieved at targetand

As  long  as  you  remain  employed  with  PG&E  Corporation,  the  Performance  Shares  will  vest  upon,  and  to  the  extent  of,  theCommittee's certification of the
 extent to which performance goals have been attained for this award, which certification will occur onor

  Except  as  described  below,  all  Performance  Shares  that  have  not  vested  will  be  cancelled  upon  termination  of  youremployment.
 
Vested
 Performance Shares will be settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction of WithholdingTaxes,
 as described below. The number of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplying the number of vestedPerformance
 Shares by the "rounded payout percentage"  determined  as follows (except  as set forth  elsewhere  in this Agreement),rounded to the nearest whole numb
er: 
 
Upon  the  Vesting  Date,  PG&E  Corporation's  total  shareholder  return  ("TSR")  will  be  compared  to  the  TSR  of  the  fourteen  othercompanies
 in PG&E Corporation's comparator group 1 for the prior  three  calendar  years,  consisting  of 2016, 2017, and 2018 (the"Performance
 Period"). 2   Subject to rounding considerations,  if PG&E Corporation's  TSR falls below the 25 th percentile of thecomparator
 group the payout percentage will be 0%; if PG&E Corporation's TSR is at the 25 th percentile, the payout percentage willbe 25%; if
 PG&E Corporation's TSR is at the 60 th percentile, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if PG&E Corporation's TSR isin
 the 90 th percentile or higher, the payout percentage will be 200%.  If PG&E Corporation's TSR performance is between the 25 th percentile
 and the target, or between the target and the 90 th percentile, the rounded payout percentage is determined by straight-lineinterpolation
 between the performance percentile associated with each comparator rank and between the rounded payouts associatedwith
 each performance percentile (including the 25 th , 60 th , and 90 th percentiles) as shown in above table, rounded down to thenearest

ternational, Eversource Energy, NiSource, Inc.,Pinnacle West Capital, SCANA Corp., Southern Company, Wiscons
in Energy Corporation, and Xcel Energy, Inc.  PG&E Corporationreserves the right to ch
ange the companies comprising the comparator group and the resulting payout percentage table in accordancewith the rules established by PG&E Corpor
ation in connection with this award. 
(2) 
PG&E Corporation's TSR performance is measured by the value of stock price appreciation and dividends paid and reinvested,relative to compani
es in the Performance Comparator Group.  For these purposes, average share price will be measured by comparingthe average per share 
closing price of PG&E Corporation common stock during the 20 trading days before the beginning and the endof the Performance Period.
 
 Dividends
Each  time that PG&E Corporation declares a dividend on its shares of common stock, an amount equal to the dividend multiplied bythe
 number of Performance Shares granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf.  If you receive a PerformanceShare
 settlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph, at that same time you also will receive a cash payment equal to theamount of any dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares over the Performance Period multiplied by the same payout
percentage used to dete
rmine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any. 
Voluntary
Termination
If  you terminate your employment with PG&E Corporation voluntarily before the Vesting Date (other than for Retirement), all of thePerformance
 Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your PerformanceShares will be forfeited.

 Performance  Shares  will  be  cancelled  as  of  the  date  of  such  termination  and  any  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  yourPerformance
 Shares will be forfeited.  In general, termination for "cause" means termination of employment because of dishonesty, acriminal offense, or v
iolation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG&E Corporation.Termination
other
than
for
Cause
If  your  employment  with  PG&E  Corporation  is  terminated  by  PG&E  Corporation  other  than  for  cause  or  Retirement  before  theVesting
 Date, a portion of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest proportionally based on the number of months during thePerformance
 Period  that  you  were  employed  (rounded  down)  divided  by  the  number  of  months  in  the  Performance  Period  (36months).
  All other outstanding Performance Shares will be cancelled, and any associated accrued dividends will be forfeited, unlessyour
 termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below. Your vested Performance Shareswill
 be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion ofthe
 Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees.  At that time you also will receive a cashpayment,
 if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your vested PerformanceShares multiplied by the sa
me payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any. 
Retirement
If  you retire before the Vesting Date, your outstanding Performance Shares will continue to vest as though your employment hadcontinued
 and will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the yearfollowing
 completion of the Performance Period based on the same payout percentage applicable to active employees.  At that timeyou
 also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect toyour
 Performance  Shares  multiplied  by  the  same  payout  percentage  used  to  determine  the  number  of  shares  you  are  entitled  toreceive,
 if  any.   Your  termination  of  employment  will  be  considered  a  Retirement  if  you  are  age  55  or  older  on  the  date  oftermination
 (other than termination for cause) and if you were employed by PG&E Corporation for at least five consecutive yearsending on the date of term
ination of your employment. 
Death/Disability
If  your employment  terminates  due to your death or disability  before the Vesting Date, all of your Performance  Shares will vestimmediately
 and  will  be  settled,  if  at  all,  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  Vesting  Date  and  no  later  than  March  15  of  the  yearfollowing completion of the Pe
rformance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees.  At that time youalso
 will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to yourPerformance
 Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, ifany.
 
Termination
Due
to
Disposition
of
Subsidiary
If your employment is terminated (other than for cause, your voluntary termination, or Retirement) (1) by reason of a divestiture orchange
 in control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longerqualifying as a subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue C
ode of 1986, as amended, or (2) coincident withthe
 sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, then your outstanding Performance Shares willvest and be settled in the s
ame manner as for a "Termination other than for Cause" described above. 
Change
in
Control
In the  event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parentthereof,
 as the case may be (the "Acquiror "
 ), may, without your consent, either assume or continue PG&E Corporation's rights andobligations
 under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subject tothis Agreement.
 
If
 the Acquiror assumes or continues PG&E Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitutes a substantiallyequivalent
 award, TSR will be calculated by combining (a) the TSR of PG&E Corporation for the period from January 1 of the yearof
 grant to the date of the Change in Control, and (b) the TSR of the Acquiror from the date of the Change in Control to the last dayof
 the Performance Period. The number of shares, if any, you are entitled to receive upon settlement of the assumed, continued orsubstituted
 Performance Share award will be  determined based on the rounded payout percentage reflected  in the table set forthabove for the highest percentile TSR performance met or exceeded when calculated on that basis, and considering any adjustments to
the
 comparator group.  Settlement will occur as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the yearfollowing
 completion of the Performance Period.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of
dividends accrued with respect to your Performance Shares over the Performance Period multiplied by the same payout percentageused to determine the numb

Performance
Goals
As  long  as  you  remain  employed  with  PG&E  Corporation,  the  Performance  Shares  will  vest  upon,  and  to  the  extent  of,  theCommittee's
 certification of the extent to which performance goals have been attained for this award, which certification will occuron
 or after January 1 but before March 15 of the third year following the calendar year of grant specified in the cover sheet (the"Vesting Date").
  Except as described below, all Performance Shares that have not vested will be cancelled upon termination of youremployment.
 
Vested
 Performance Shares will be settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction of WithholdingTaxes,
 as described below. The number of shares you are entitled to receive will be calculated by multiplying the number of vestedPerformance
 Shares by the "payout percentage" determined as follows (except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement), rounded tothe nearest whole number:
 
Fifty  percent of the Performance Shares have a safety performance goal and resulting safety payout percentage, and the other fiftypercent
 of the Performance Shares have an affordability performance goal and resulting affordability payout percentage.  Subject torounding
 considerations,  in each case,  if performance  is below threshold, the payout percentage  will be 0%; if performance  is atthreshold,
 the payout percentage will be 25%; if performance is at target, the payout percentage will be 100%; and if performance isat
 or better than maximum, the payout percentage will be 200%.  The actual payout percentage for performance between thresholdand maximum will
 be determined based on linear interpolation between the payout percentages for threshold and target, or target andmaximum, as appropriate.
 
The measures and goals are d
iscussed in more detail below: 
Safety 
-  At  the  end  of  2018,  PG&E  Corporation's  lost  workday  ("LWD")  case  rate  ("LWD  Rate")  for  that  year  will  bemeasured
 as the number of LWD cases incurred per 200,000 hours worked during 2018. LWD cases will be measured inthe same manner
 as for the 2016 Short-Term Incentive Plan, will include OSHA recordable incidents that result in loss of atleast
 one workday, and will exclude fatalities.  Threshold performance is 0.247, target performance is 0.215, and maximumperformance is 0.201.
 
Affordability 
-  PG&E  Corporation's  affordability  performance  will  be  measured  as  the  reduction  in  standard  rate  caseexpense
 for unitized work and support operations and maintenance costs over the three calendar years prior to the normalVesting
 Date (the "Performance Period"), as compared to escalated actual costs in these areas for 2014, escalated by twoyears
 (at 2.75 perent per year) , as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee in accordance with the terms adoptedby
 the Committee at its February 16, 2016 meeting.   Threshold performance  is $75 million,  target performance  is $100million, and maximum pe
rformance is $200 million. 
The
 final  payout  percentages,  if  any,  will  be  determined  as  soon  as  practicable  following  the  date  that  the  Committee  (or  asubcommittee
 of  that  Committee)  or  an  equivalent  body  certifies  the  extent  to  which  the  performance  goals  have  been  attained,pursuant
 to Section 10.5(a) of the LTIP.  PG&E Corporation will issue shares as soon as practicable after such determination, but noearlier than the Vest
ing Date, and not later than March 15 of the calendar year following completion of the Performance Period. 
Dividends
Each  time that PG&E Corporation declares a dividend on its shares of common stock, an amount equal to the dividend multiplied bythe
 number of Performance Shares granted to you by this Agreement will be accrued on your behalf.  If you receive a PerformanceShare
 settlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph, at that same time you also will receive a cash payment equal to theamount
 of  any  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  your  Performance  Shares  over  the  Performance  Period  multiplied  by  the  samepayout percentage used to de
termine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any. 
Voluntary
Termination
If you terminate  your employment with PG&E Corporation voluntarily before the Vesting Date (other than for Retirement), all of thePerformance
 Shares will be cancelled as of the date of such termination and any dividends accrued with respect to your PerformanceShares will be forfeited.
 
Termination
for
Cause
If  your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG&E Corporation for cause before the Vesting Date, allof
 the  Performance  Shares  will  be  cancelled  as  of  the  date  of  such  termination  and  any  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  yourPerformance Shares will be
 forfeited.  In general, termination for "cause" means termination of employment because of dishonesty, a
criminal offense, or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG&E Corporation. 
Termination
other
than
for
Cause
If  your  employment  with  PG&E  Corporation  is  terminated  by  PG&E  Corporation  other  than  for  cause  or  Retirement  before  theVesting
 Date, a portion of your outstanding Performance Shares will vest proportionally based on the number of months during thePerformance
 Period  that  you  were  employed  (rounded  down)  divided  by  the  number  of  months  in  the  Performance  Period  (36months).
  All other outstanding Performance Shares will be cancelled, and any associated accrued dividends will be forfeited, unlessyour
 termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below. Your vested Performance Shareswill
 be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the year following completion ofthe
 Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees.  At that time you also will receive a cashpayment,
 if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to your vested PerformanceShares multiplied by the sa
me payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, if any. 
Retirement
If  you retire before the Vesting Date, your outstanding Performance Shares will continue to vest as though your employment hadcontinued
 and will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the yearfollowing
 completion of the Performance Period, based on the same payout percentage applicable to active employees.  At that timeyou
 also will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect toyour
 Performance  Shares  multiplied  by  the  same  payout  percentage  used  to  determine  the  number  of  shares  you  are  entitled  toreceive,
 if  any.    Your  termination  of  employment  will  be  considered  a  Retirement  if  you  are  age  55  or  older  on  the  date  oftermination
 (other than termination for cause) and if you were employed by PG&E Corporation for at least five consecutive yearsending on the date of term
ination of your employment. 
Death/Disability
If  your  employment  terminates  due  to  your  death  or  disability  before  the  Vesting  Date,  all  of  your  Performance  Shares  willimmediately
 vest and will be settled, if at all, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later than March 15 of the yearfollowing completion of the Pe
rformance Period, based on the same payout percentage applied to active employees.  At that time youalso
 will receive a cash payment, if any, equal to the amount of dividends accrued over the Performance Period with respect to yourPerformance
 Shares multiplied by the same payout percentage used to determine the number of shares you are entitled to receive, ifany.
 
Termination
Due
to

Subsidiary
 If your employment is terminated (other than for cause, your voluntary termination, or Retirement) (1) by reason of a divestiture orchange
 in control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longerqualifying as a subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue C

 sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, then your outstanding Performance Shares willvest and be settled in the s
ame manner as for a "Termination other than for Cause" described above.

 under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subject tothis Agreement.
 
If
 the Acquiror assumes or continues PG&E Corporation's rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitutes a substantiallyequivalent
 award,  Performance  Shares  will  vest  on  the  Vesting  Date,  and  performance  will  be  deemed  to  have  been  achieved  attarget, resulting
 in a payout percentage of 100%. Settlement will occur as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date and no later thanMarch
 15 of the year following completion of the Performance Period.  At that time you also will receive a cash payment, if any,equal
 to  the  amount  of  dividends  accrued  with  respect  to  your  Performance  Shares  over  the  Performance  Period  multiplied  by  apayout percentage of 100%.
 
If the Change in Control of PG&E Corporation occurs bef
ore the Vesting Date, and if this award is neither assumed nor continued bythe
 Acquiror or if the Acquiror does not provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Performance Shares subjectto
