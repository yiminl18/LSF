CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and Johnson & Johnson’s other publicly available documents contain “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson &
Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements
may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with,
among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and
dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company’s
Consumer Health business; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to
uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition
could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to
rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s
continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory
approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and
technologies in the United States and other important markets;
•The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue
and market share losses;
•Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic,
biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such
challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;
•Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process
obsolescence;
•Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and
technologies;
•Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the
Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory
action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage,
increased litigation expense and share price impact;
•The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including
product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product
liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;
•Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions,
which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant
sanctions;
•Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new
products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare
products and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw materials;
•Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets,
including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union’s Medical
Devices Regulation;
•Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to
additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and
•The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives, Healthcare Market Trends and the Planned Separation of the Company’s Consumer Health
Business
•Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and
other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of healthcare
expenses, significant new entrants to the healthcare markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce
costs and price increases;
•Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and services due to economic hardship
and budgetary constraints;
•Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development
collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements
due to competitive pressures;
•The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may
not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer
to realize than expected;
•The Company’s ability to consummate the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business on a timely basis or at all;
•The Company’s ability to successfully separate the Company’s Consumer Health business and realize the anticipated benefits from the planned
separation; and
•The New Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally
•The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which
the Company operates;
•The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues,
expenses and resulting margins;
•Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade
restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;
•The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental
controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;
•The impact of global public health crises and pandemics, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic;
•Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company’s products and services, cause
disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall
design and integrity of the Company’s products and operations; and
•The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including social and economic disruptions and
instability of financial and other markets.
Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary
or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential
regulatory action;
•Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the Company’s vendors, which could result in
reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;
•Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that
may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and
•The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain may not be
realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities.
Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that
could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should
understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made
from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.
PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
General
    Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting
business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was
incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
    The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health,
Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international
operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the
business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located.
Segments of Business
    The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by
this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 17 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Consumer Health
    The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare used in the Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter
medicines, Baby Care, Oral Care, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. Major brands in Skin Health/Beauty include the AVEENO; CLEAN &
CLEAR; DR. CI:LABO; NEUTROGENA and OGX product lines. Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL
acetaminophen products; SUDAFED cold, flu and allergy products; BENADRYL and ZYRTEC allergy products; MOTRIN IB ibuprofen products;
NICORETTE smoking cessation products outside the U.S.; ZARBEE’S products, inspired by nature, and the PEPCID line of acid reflux products.
Baby Care includes the JOHNSON’S and AVEENO Baby line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE product line. Major brands in Women’s
Health outside of North America are STAYFREE and CAREFREE sanitary pads and o.b. tampon brands. Wound Care brands include the BAND-AID
Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN First Aid product lines. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and
to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.
In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly
traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.
Pharmaceutical
    The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease

collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.
Medical Devices
    The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery, and Vision fields. Medical
Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care
(Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees,
Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery offerings (Ethicon), solutions that focus on Breast
Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson & Johnson Vision products such as ACUVUE Brand disposable
contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers,
and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. Beginning in the fiscal first quarter of
2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech segment.
Geographic Areas
    Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer Health,”
“– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with
the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and
commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system
uncertainties.
Raw Materials
    Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary
unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
Patents
    The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are
licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries
face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key
pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and® ®

®
®
® ®
®

®
®
®
®
2
claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
    
Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.7% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021.
Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA.The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest
expiring European composition of matter patent expires in 2024.
Sales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and
hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 6.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are
believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license
to those patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2032.
Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO.
Trademarks
    The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all
available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers
these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
Seasonality
    Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other
quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.
Competition
    In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines
without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the
development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative
products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of
its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of
customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Environment
    The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in
all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a
material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
Regulation
    The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general
trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental
regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the
drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy,
manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S.
FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a
corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device
regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.
    The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product
withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls.
    The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are
not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical®
® 
® ®
®
®
3
devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products,
order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of
foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm
to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a
company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to
the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our
products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and
operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business.
    
The costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and
legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and
programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and
regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased
focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require
disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-
physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain
prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased
attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally.
    
U.S. government actors continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA)
which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-
sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered
by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA
benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains
uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar, which
challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains
in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer
discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform
proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape has both positive and
negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or
repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry.
    In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state
attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
    Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory
requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply
and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.
The global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and global economies. The U.S.
FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related
disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new
drugs and devices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.

Employees and Human Capital Management
As of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the number of employees were approximately:
2021 2020 
Employees 144,300 136,400 
Full-time equivalent (FTE) positions 141,700 134,500 
“Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more
recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded.
 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of individual employees as some work part-time.
 
Strategy
The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term strategy. Management is
responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes
related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus
areas:
•Attracting and recruiting the best talent
•Developing and retaining talent
•Empowering and inspiring talent
Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation,
health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company
achieve its business goals.
Culture and Employee Engagement
At Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers,
healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct
which sets basic requirements for business conduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide
additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the
ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2021, 91% of
global employees across 77 countries participated in Our Voice Survey which was offered in 36 languages.
Growth and Development
To continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. The Company
believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers.
Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources

are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a
robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to
ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2021, 45.8% of employees in Manager and above job
categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (including upward promotion or lateral
transfer and excluding employees in the research and development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 8%.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. Enabling
employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's continued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself,
change the world. The Company's DEI strategy focuses on three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the
challenges and opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity:
•Accelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation
•Build a diverse workforce for the future
•Enhance business results and reputation
The Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual employee feedback which remind the
Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere.
Compensation and Benefits
As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. The
Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal
minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees'
financial, physical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and
welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
Health, Wellness and Safety
The Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with
advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as
well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being
programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help
employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and
financial—help ensure employee health protection from emerging health risks.
Safety and COVID-19 Pandemic Response
Protecting and supporting our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a top priority and our approach includes: keeping
employees informed of local COVID-19 transmission rates and corresponding risk levels; promoting the health and safety of our employees in the
workplace through robust layers of protection; enhanced cleaning and access to cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment; supporting employees
with pay continuity, benefits and well-being tools; and recognizing extraordinary employee contributions at work and in our communities. In 2021, in
recognition of the new way of working, we initiated J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers our office-based employees to find the right productivity and
balance of in-person and remote work. This model allows for work to happen seamlessly across a variety of workplaces and is enabled by an array of
enhanced collaboration tools and technology to optimize productivity and connection. J&J Flex rolled out in fourth quarter 2021 globally, and will continue
deployment through 2022 as protocol and requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic allow. The Company is evaluating flexible work strategies for
its on-site workforce, such as virtual on-boarding and training, to help our employees balance their personal and professional lives. Also, we continued to
enhance our benefits offerings with access to wellness tools, on-site vaccine clinics, mental health support resources and delivery of at-home testing kits. In
addition, as COVID-19 vaccines were broadly distributed and administered in 2021, including the one developed by Johnson & Johnson, we adopted
policies in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and certain other countries to require proof of vaccination from Johnson & Johnson employees and contingent workers, in
order to return to our sites, where permitted by local law and regulation. In the U.S. and Puerto Rico, this requirement took effect on October 4, 2021, with
processes established for granting accommodations to those with medical or religious needs. Select manufacturing and distribution employees and
contractors in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as certain additional countries, are adopting similar policies through early 2022.

Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to identify, manage and
mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be
eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors
set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete
discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or
financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.
Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations
The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings.
The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with
companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived
product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to
acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in
significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly
products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could
negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the
related product development.
For the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors
gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for
a biological product. For the Company’s Medical Devices businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are
especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make
the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition
from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer
products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.
Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation.
The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The
Company’s subsidiaries operate 85 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the
past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing
disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages, site-
specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist
attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact
as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party manufacturer could result in delays
and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of
their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver
those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our
near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.
Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and
quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing
agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or
inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under material agreements,
experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in
efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the
8
Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect
our business adversely.
Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a
growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our
rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic
version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated,
unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.
The industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in
our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from
their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the
Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants
(COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s
business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The
spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Company’s employees),
and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our
patients, customers, employees and business partners. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans
in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from
being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.
While the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Company’s future
operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and impact of variants. Any
resurgence in COVID-19 could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of
the disease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our
manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could
adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.
We also face uncertainties related to our COVID-19 vaccine, including uncertainties related to the risk that our continued development programs may not
be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further
analyses of its efficacy, safety and durability; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer
review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory
authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce
superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw
materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks
associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk
that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a
manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or
product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods
indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such
products, including in the U.S.
In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of
the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and those incorporated by reference herein, including risks relating to the Company’s effective tax
rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in laws relating to supply of the Company’s products. Given that developments concerning
the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the
Company.

Risks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings
Global sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing
pricing pressures.
Sales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as
government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these
payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on
behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further
pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including
the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose
price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.
The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as
product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or
consumer protection laws. The Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district
litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large
and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a
defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale,
manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate
outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters,
potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution
of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly
owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.
Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and
cause reputational damage.
Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence,
can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its
counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These
circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and
could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related
sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government
investigations, legal actions and penalties.
Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action by national, state and local
government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing
Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines
and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing,
pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare
industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of
significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought
by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this Report.®
10
Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in
any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which
the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The
Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and
any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
See Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In
connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world,
which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and
disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the
Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
The Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These
rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the
U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection
for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally
anticipated.
Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences,
oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These
proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of
third parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of
the products in question.
The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the
Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic
versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the
Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation
Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed
biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the
USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.
In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of
its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving
the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Risks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization
Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse
impact on the Company’s long-term success.
The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the
evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful
11
products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as
competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. The
Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether
particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.
The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and
licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology
products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development
programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’
future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property
protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from
competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the
marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or
uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and
efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.
Risks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions
The Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally.
The Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, economic, legal, social and political
risks, including those listed below.
Foreign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2021, approximately 50% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 25% in Europe,
6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 19% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the
U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are
translated into U.S. dollars.
Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high
inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation
rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and
periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries
experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or
other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the
Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal
under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced
imports has grown significantly.
Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with
respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded
companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the
purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore
involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human
pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;

therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application
and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed
at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional
administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including
exclusion from healthcare programs.
Other Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:
•local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic
growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash;
•protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;
•compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture
or sell its products in the relevant market;
•diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
•potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;
•political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and
•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics.
Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely
evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating
agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur,
reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any
announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital
markets.
Risks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business
The planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all,
and may not achieve the expected results.
In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly
traded company. The planned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting
completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement. Completion of the planned separation will be subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies, as required, final approval of
the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable opinion and Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the
transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned separation or that such
separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation, including but not
limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or
clearances.
The costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and
financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business.
The Company will incur significant expenses in connection with the planned separation. In addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full
strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the planned separation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a
number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect.
13
Following the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly.
The Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock, and the market value of shares of its
common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the
price of the Company’s common stock may be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.
The planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.
The Company intends to obtain an opinion from its U.S. tax advisors and a ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation under the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion and ruling will be based on, among other things, various factual assumptions and
representations that the Company and the New Consumer Health Company will make regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective
businesses and other matters. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinion and ruling
may be jeopardized. If subsequent to the planned separation it is determined that the transaction does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify for
tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company.
Other Risks
Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce.
Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for
highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate
highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work
environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders,
our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our
long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions
involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations.
Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our
operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities
and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to
access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs.
Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or
mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we
may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely
affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences, and
failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in loss of market share.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation.
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their
vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data
that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity
threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection,
detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To
date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however,
because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the
Company to be adversely
14
impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The
Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover
all financial, legal, business or reputational losses.
A breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation.
The Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, use, storage,
access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such requirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and
damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental
authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs
and controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the
Company and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border data flows, unauthorized access,
and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact our business operations and research activities.

    McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) operated under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the U.S. FDA, which
governed certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and required McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the “Consent Decree”). Following U.S. FDA inspections McNEIL-PPC
received notifications from the U.S FDA that all three manufacturing facilities were in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial
production restarted in 2015.
Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the U.S. FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three
facilities was subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. A third-party expert continued to reassess the sites at various times through
2020. U.S. FDA inspections of the facilities which have been delayed due to COVID-19 were completed and the Consent Decree was vacated in July of
2021.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Organization and Business Segments
Description of the Company and Business Segments
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment
includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound
Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.
The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary
Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals
and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery,
Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and
used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business
segments.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all
product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as
protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for
the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Management’s Objectives
With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for
humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this
common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.
The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products
and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. In 2021, $14.7 billion was invested in
research and development reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will
profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.
A critical driver of the Company’s success is the diversity of its 141,700 employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with
the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and
to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with
excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact,
ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.

Results of Operations
Analysis of Consolidated Sales
For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
In 2021, worldwide sales increased 13.6% to $93.8 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2020. These sales changes consisted of the following:
Sales incr ease/(decr ease) due to: 2021 2020
Volume 12.9 % 3.5 %
Price (0.7) (2.3)
Currency 1.4 (0.6)
Total 13.6 % 0.6 %
The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.6% in 2021 and a negative impact of 0.3% in
2020.
Sales by U.S. companies were $47.2 billion in 2021 and $43.1 billion in 2020. This represents increases of 9.3% in 2021 and 2.5% in 2020. Sales by
international companies were $46.6 billion in 2021 and $39.5 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of 18.2% in 2021 and a decrease of 1.3% in 2020.
The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 5.5%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively. The ten-year
compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.7%, 5.0% and 2.6%, respectively.
In 2021, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 24.3% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 20.7% and a
positive currency impact of 3.6%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 7.8% as compared to the prior
year, which included operational growth of 7.3% and a positive currency impact of 0.5%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved
growth of 14.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 11.4% and a positive currency impact of 2.7%.
The Company estimated that the inclusion of a 53rd week in the fiscal year 2020 results negatively impacted the 2021 comparative sales growth by
approximately 1.0%. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week added a few days
to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.
In 2021, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0%
of the total consolidated revenues. In 2020, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately
16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues.

Total Consumer Health Sales $ 14,635 14,053 4.1 %
The OTC franchise sales of $5.2 billion increased 8.4% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily attributable to Analgesics, TYLENOL
and MOTRIN, digestive health and the hydration benefit offering (ORSL).
The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.5 billion increased 2.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily due to COVID-19
recovery, strong performance of NEUTROGENA and AVEENO, and eCommerce acceleration partially offset by the divestiture of DR. CI:LABO -
Sedona business in Asia Pacific and external supply constraints.
The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 0.2% as compared to the prior year. Market growth in the U.S. along with strong performance in
the Asia Pacific region due to successful brand building and promotional campaigns and the positive impact of currency offset the negative impact of the
floss divestiture and U.S. external supply constraints.
The Baby Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 3.2% compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by AVEENO Asia Pacific eCommerce
strength, innovation and COVID-19 recovery.
The Women’s Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion increased 1.8% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by COVID-19 market recovery,
favorable price and strong brand building in Asia Pacific partially offset by disruptions in Europe due to flooding.
The Wound Care/Other franchise sales of $0.7 billion increased 2.6% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance of BAND-
AID Brand Adhesive Bandages in the U.S. partially offset by product discontinuations and competitive pressures in Asia Pacific.
In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new,
publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.®

Immunology products achieved sales of $16.8 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11.3% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake
of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA(guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic
Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE(infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.
Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional
competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.
The latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal
2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales.
Infectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was
primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTAand PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA
(darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTAin certain countries outside the U.S.
Neuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting
injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA from new
patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA™.
Oncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth
were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by continued strong market growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the
subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) growth
primarily driven by market and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive pressures from
novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts.
Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of
OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth.
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily
attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT/ EPREX(epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar
competition.® ®

Medical Devices Segment
The Medical Devices segment sales in 2021 were $27.1 billion, an increase of 17.9% from 2020, which included operational growth of 16.2% and a
positive currency impact of 1.7%. U.S. sales were $12.7 billion, an increase of 14.9% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $14.4 billion,
an increase of 20.6% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 17.3% and a positive currency impact of 3.3%. In 2021, the net
impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 0.6% primarily due to the
divestiture of Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP). The Company has seen a market recovery in global procedural volumes in the Medical Devices
segment as compared to the prior year which had significant negative impacts from COVID-19. This procedural volume recovery is the primary driver of
sales and earnings growth as compared to the prior year.

Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering,
testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy
and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high
quality and innovative products.
Research and Development increased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:
•General portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business
•COVID-19 vaccine expenses, net of governmental reimbursements
In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to
expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment
charge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two
years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The Company will continue to monitor the remaining $1.5 billion Ottava
platform intangible asset as development program activities are ongoing. In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion
primarily related to a partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition.
On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year 2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the
decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of
approximately $0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment
of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment charge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be
reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down
of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, income
and losses associated with certain employee benefit programs, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-
related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income.
29
Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2021 was favorable by $2.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:

2021 is primarily related to talc and Risperdal. 2020 is primarily related to talc and the opioid litigation settlement.
2021 is primarily related to divestiture gains of two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S.
2020 is primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the
Auris Health acquisition.
2021 includes Consumer Health separation costs of $0.1 billion. Costs in future years are expected to be significantly higher .
Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2021 included net interest expense of $130 million as compared to $90 million net interest expense in the
fiscal year 2020. This was primarily due to lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance, partially offset by the benefit
from net investment hedging. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $31.6 billion at the end of 2021, and averaged $28.4 billion as
compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $25.2 billion and $22.2 billion average cash balance in 2020. The total debt
balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion with an average debt balance of $34.5 billion as compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2020 and an average
debt balance of $31.5 billion.

Consumer Health Segment:
In 2021, the Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales was 8.8% versus a loss before tax of 7.6% in 2020. The increase in the
income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:
•2021 litigation expense includes $1.6 billion of talc expenses; 2020 includes $3.9 billion of talc expenses
•Supply chain efficiencies
partially offset by:
•Increased brand marketing expenses and commodity inflation
Pharmaceutical Segment:
In 2021, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 34.9% versus 33.9% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a
percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:
•Divestiture gains of $0.6 billion related to two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. in fiscal 2021
•2021 litigation expense includes $0.6 billion primarily related to Risperdal; 2020 includes $0.8 billion primarily related to the opioid litigation

Medical Devices Segment: In 2021, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.2% versus 13.3% in 2020. The increase
in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:
•Recovery of prior year COVID-19 production related slow downs and related inventory impacts
•Overall expense leveraging resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery
•Litigation expense of $0.1 billion in 2021 vs. $0.3 billion in 2020
partially offset by:
•A contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in the fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones
associated with the Auris Health acquisition
•A higher IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion ($0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava) acquired with the
Auris Health acquisition in 2019)
Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended
to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply
its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of
strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its
network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In
total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by
the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that
approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is
included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1
billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program is
set to be completed at the end of 2022.
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.
Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 8.3% in 2021 and 10.8% in 2020.

As of January 2, 2022, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of
January 2, 2022, the net debt position was $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.1 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to
repayment of debt and an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities generating from operations. The debt balance at the end of 2021 was
$33.8 billion as compared to $35.3 billion in 2020. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated
its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the
ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will
continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments
associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the opioid litigation settlement for $5.0 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for
talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital
markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax
Cuts and Job Act of 2017 currently requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5
to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a result, the Company is expecting an increase in annual cash tax payments to the U.S Treasury of an
incremental $1.0 to 1.5 billion beginning in fiscal 2022. The Company will concurrently record a deferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the
research and development (R&D) for tax purposes and therefore, the Company is not expecting a significant impact to its effective tax rate related to this
change. The requirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is not affected by this
provision. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced
cost. During the fiscal third quarter of
32
2021, in accordance with the terms of the agreement associated with the acquisition of Actelion, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was
terminated.
The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 2, 2022: To satisfy these
obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

Financing and Market Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into
forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions
primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of
the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely,
a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by
$0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore,
would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by
entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $2.2 billion. In either scenario, at
maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on
future anticipated cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into
contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is
no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit
support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting
agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of
fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if
interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the
unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $0.1 billion.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2021, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 8, 2022. Interest charged on borrowings under
the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus
applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
Total borrowings at the end of 2021 and 2020 were $33.8 billion and $35.3 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the repayment
of debt. In 2021, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $2.1 billion compared to net debt of $10.1 billion in 2020. Total debt
represented 31.3% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2021 and 35.8% of total capital in 2020. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end
of 2021 was $28.16 compared to $24.04 at year-end 2020.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dividends
The Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020.
On January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of
February 22, 2022.
Other Information
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires
that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures.
Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates
are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue
recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for
pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not
limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates,
employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The
Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information
reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The
accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related
reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and
duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting
periods.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are
satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90
days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback
provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through
the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical
Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The
sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.
Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on
historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period
and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in
34
sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative
partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part
of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
disclosures on collaborations.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect
on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a
material financial statement impact.
Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by
segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between
U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the
Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts.
The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at
current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.
See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability
claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals
in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable
and can be reasonably estimated.
See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions
regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these
assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination
indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,
mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on these rates.
Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their
services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a
combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the
service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.
Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational
sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market
value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.  The fair
values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time
of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total
shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Economic and Market Factors
COVID-19 considerations and business continuity
The Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results
based upon information available at this time, as follows:
•Operating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing,
research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.
•Supply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and
maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to help ensure adequate and effective distribution.
•Business Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company
for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted.
•Workforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research
operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees.
•Liquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future.
•Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the
COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have
a material impact on the Company’s operations.
In fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract
manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and
potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. Amounts paid for services to be delivered and contractually obligated to be
paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $1.1 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued
liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has
entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations.
The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements, including its contract with Emergent BioSolutions
and related production activities at its Bayview, Maryland facility. The Company has established a global vaccine supply network, where, in addition to its
internal manufacturing site in Leiden, the Netherlands, ten other manufacturing sites will be involved in the production of vaccine across different countries
and continents. The Company does not believe that a disruption at a vaccine manufacturing site, or the resulting delay would have a material financial
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or results.
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have
expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products
responsibly. For the period 2011 - 2021, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for
healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to
monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way
companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative
inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company
strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies
in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2021 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately
$0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.2 billion.
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory
tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around
the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the
revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This
change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these
proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit
recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and
government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of healthcare products.
38
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing
prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic
downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.
The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug
Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's
patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents
covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or
biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for
those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors
could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.
Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial,
employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation
matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and
adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other
litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or
range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events
and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments
can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate;
scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are
significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve
comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent
adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be
probable and can be reasonably estimated.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding legal proceedings.
Common Stock
The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 10, 2022, there were 127,899 record
holders of Common Stock of the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded
figures.
Description of the Company and Business Segments
The Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of
products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to
human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment
includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound
Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.
The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary
Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals
and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery,
Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and
used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new,
publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.
New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
There were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022
The Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's
financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.
ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform
In mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on
LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and
other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company
evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):
Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including
any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate
(primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate “SOFR” where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in
scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference
rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.
Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly
liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy
of making investments only with commercial institutions that have
47
at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities,
money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).
RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The
Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that
the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that
collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date
of purchase are classified as marketable securities.
Investments
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments
classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as
long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates
such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through
earnings, as required. 
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years
Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
generally range from 3 to 8 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or
economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is
determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not
available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs
with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain
rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as
variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the
consolidated balance sheet.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's
pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion and $7.2 billion
as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through
the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the
48
Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.
The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.
Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on
historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period
and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers.
For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in
selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all
periods presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The
Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth
quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying
project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the
intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by
economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
Financial Instruments
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1
having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for
undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the
Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness
of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial
Instruments.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of
identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating
leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an
underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance
leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance
sheet.
ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the
lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of
lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are
included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach
49
on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease
components.
The Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. The ROU asset pertaining to
operating leases was $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lease liability was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 2021and 2020,
respectively. The operating lease costs were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included
in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Product Liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted
periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when
those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not
record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that
exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments
made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments
made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts
capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize
drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are
exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by
one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and
royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due
from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the
performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these
collaborations is as follows:
Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation
Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers
Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory
approval)*Cost of products sold
Royalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net
Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-
regulatory approval)Research and development expense
Research and development payments to collaborative partner Research and development expense
Research and development payments received from collaborative partner or
government entityReduction of Research and development expense
*Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.
The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO, co-developed with
Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.
Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX, licensed from Genmab A/S.
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.7 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion in fiscal years
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.®

Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP
accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax
regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
In 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a
comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January
1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed
earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over
8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2021 was
approximately $6.9 billion, of which $6.1 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet.
The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.
The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s
total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows
companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or
provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years
upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are
based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the
Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts.
The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at
current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Net Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common
stock using the treasury stock method.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives,
product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability
valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and
can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not
limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates,
employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The
Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information
reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The
accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related
reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets along with the Company’s on-going
vaccine development and distribution efforts. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the
fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in
material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
51
Annual Closing Date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year
consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in
fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

5.Intangible Assets and Goodwill
At the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were:
(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020
Intangible assets with definite lives:   
Patents and trademarks — gross $ 38,572 39,990

Total intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 16,822 19,044 
Total intangible assets — net $ 46,392 53,402 
The majority is comprised of customer relationships
In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment char ge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general sur gery digital
robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment char ge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow
valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The
remaining reduction was driven by assets that reached commercialization and are now classified as having definite lives.
Goodwill as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, as allocated by segment of business, was as follows:

6.Fair Value Measurements(1)

(1)
(2)
55
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange
rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are
designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment
hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These
forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings,
thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features.
The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit
ratings and netting agreements. As of January 2, 2022, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $570 million
net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers
credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment
grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and
payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange
contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $45.8 billion, $37.4 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively. As of January 3, 2021, the
Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps of $37.8 billion and $30.6
billion, respectively.
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge
transaction.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly
effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these
contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the
hedged transaction.
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to
interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within
accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot
method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and
when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the
Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by
changes in exchange rates.
As of January 2, 2022, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $336 million after-tax.
For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the
amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected
to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate
contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are
ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

For the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 for equity investments without readily determinable market values, $28 million and $76
million, respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were offsetting impacts of $422 million and
$21 million, respectively, of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments. The
impact in fiscal 2021 was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment.
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs
used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all
future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot
foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be
realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The
Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose
values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant
judgment or estimations.
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.
The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 were as

The excess of the fair value over the carrying value of debt was $3.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2021 and $5.4 billion at the end of fiscal year
2020.
Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable
inputs.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2021, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 8, 2022. Interest charged on borrowings under
the credit line agreement is based on either the Term SOFR Reference Rate or other applicable market rates as allowed under the terms of the agreement,
plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material.
Throughout fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term
borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.8 billion and $2.6 billion at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020,
respectively. The current portion of the long term debt was $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the remainder is commercial
paper and local borrowing by international subsidiaries.
The current debt balance as of January 2, 2022 includes $1.6 billion of commercial paper which has a weighted average interest rate of 0.11% and a
weighted average maturity of approximately three months.

(1) For all periods presented the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentives. International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with
statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The
2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are
further described below.
(2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. The 2021 amounts include the
reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which is further described below.
(3) Represents impact of adjustments to balances originally recorded as part of the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. Further information provided below.
The fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5% compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year
2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company
increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately
$0.6 billion net benefit or 2.7% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:
•approximately $2.3 billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these assets to fair value, this benefit has
been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•approximately $1.7 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these
deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
Also, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain
intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which is reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax
rate reconciliation. Additionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:
•the Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $1.6 billion for talc at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and $0.8 billion for
Risperdal settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).
•the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019)
at an effective rate of 22.4% (See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).
The fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate. which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year
2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal
transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be
depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.
TRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax
parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development(1)
(2)
(3)
63
tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit
or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the
fiscal year 2019, as described in further detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that period.
During the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation. Additionally, the Company
received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings
resulted in the Company revising its estimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded additional
deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss Tax Reform of approximately $0.4 billion or 2.6%
benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:
•approximately $0.3 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and
cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•a $450 million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets as
described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•approximately $0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss
deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s
effective tax rate reconciliation.
The Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.
Also, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain
intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2% which is reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax
rate reconciliation. In addition, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:
•the impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $4.0 billion which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of
23.5%;
•the accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $1.0 billion associated with a revised agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation
at an effective tax rate of 21.4%
The Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note 18) and reversed of some of its
unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.
In fiscal year 2019, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of
2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the
applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $0.6 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.2 billion for U.S. foreign tax
credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $0.4 billion decreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2%. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related
impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. The following items also impacted the fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate:
•The impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $4 billion (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which
reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately
2.1%.
•In December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in the Company revising the amount
of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company
recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to these foreign tax credits of approximately $0.3 billion or 1.7% to the annual effective tax rate.
This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•The Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its unrecognized tax benefit by $0.3 billion
liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.5% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional
information). As these positions were related to uncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as
“International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
64
As described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $0.1 billion which increased the
effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6%. This net tax expense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year
2019 consisting of the following provisions:
•approximately $0.6 billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and
cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense has been reflected as “International Operations” on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•a $0.9 billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets; this
benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
•approximately $450 million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss
deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the Federal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on
international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation
Amount is inclusive of the $2.3 billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reor ganized ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as
previously described.
The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these
subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. However, in certain jurisdictions, valuation allowances have
been recorded against deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances are not material.

The unrecognized tax benefits of $3.3 billion at January 2, 2022, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company
conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the
United States, the IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In the fiscal year 2020,
the Company made its final payments for approximately$0.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2008. The Company believes
it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States.
However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax
positions.
The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities, except as previously noted on
amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax
expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $44 million, $32 million and $50 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The total amount of accrued interest was $512 million and $468 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
9.Employee Related Obligations

10.Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover
most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their
dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.
In the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last five
years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are
calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).
In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,
regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits
accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases the
Projected Benefit Obligation as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $1.8 billion and is included in the “Amendments” line in the Change in Benefit
Obligation.
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.
The Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.
In 2021 and 2020 the Company used December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international
retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2021, 2020 and 2019 include the following
components:

Net periodic benefit cost $ 623 790 593 503 524 551 
The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings where other
employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold, Research and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative
expenses. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings.
Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active
employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using
a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.
Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan
amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan
participants at the time of the plan amendment.

Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.01 % 4.00 4.01 4.21 4.27 4.29 
The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The
resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses
duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.
The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios
globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the
various asset class allocations by market.

The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in
accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans.
For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that
are not funded.
In 2021, the Company contributed $102 million and $867 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.
The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded

Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of the pension plans. In
determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors
70
including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance
funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of
local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans.
Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.
The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2021 and 2020 and target allocations for 2022 are as follows:
Percent of
Plan AssetsTarget
Allocation
 2021 2020 2022
Worldwide Retirement Plans
Equity securities 65 % 66 % 61 %
Debt securities 35 34 39 
Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 %
Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If
listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market
parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or
assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Valuation Hierarchy
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are
described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares
outstanding.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.
•Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the
custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a
quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.
•Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on
which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models,
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an
active market, they are classified as Level 2.
•Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual
securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.
•Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.
Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
•Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category
have a quoted market price.
71
•Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by
the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are
classified as Level 2.

14.International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international
subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative
rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority
of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account
includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those
located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are
reflected in the operating results.
A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.
Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $236 million, $209 million and $267 million in fiscal
years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
15.Earnings Per Share
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021
and December 29, 2019:
(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2021 2020 2019
Basic net earnings per share $ 7.93 5.59 5.72 
Average shares outstanding — basic 2,632.1 2,632.8 2,645.1 
Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 138.0 118.3 136.3 
Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method (96.1) (80.4) (97.8)
Convertible debt shares — — 0.7 
Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,674.0 2,670.7 2,684.3 
Diluted net earnings per share $ 7.81 5.51 5.63 
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2021 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was less
than the average market value of the Company's stock. As of January 2, 2022, the Company did not have convertible debt.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded 18 million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options
was greater than the average market value of the Company's stock. As of January 3, 2021, the Company did not have convertible debt.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price
of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019
included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1 million after-tax.
16.Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
At January 2, 2022, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares
granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to
650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to
April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 240 million at the end of fiscal year 2021.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $1,135 million, $1,005 million and $977 million for fiscal years 2021,
2020 and 2019, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $218 million, $210
million and $227 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $223 million,
$248 million and $209 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The
total unrecognized compensation cost was $862 million, $804 million and $823 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,
74
respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.78 years, 1.76 years and 1.71 years for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through market purchases throughout the
year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.
Stock Options
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the
average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted
in the following table. For 2021, 2020 and 2019 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and
a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is
used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $20.86, $16.42 and $17.80, in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value was estimated
based on the weighted average assumptions of:
2021 2020 2019
Risk-free rate 0.83 % 1.47 % 2.56 %
Expected volatility 18.59 % 15.33 % 16.27 %
Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0
Expected dividend yield 2.50 % 2.60 % 2.80 %

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance
share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance
share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a
three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted
operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted
goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.
The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target
number of performance share units granted.
A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 2, 2022 is presented below:
(Shares in Thousands)Outstanding Restricted
Share UnitsOutstanding
Performance Share Units
Shares at January 3, 2021 14,998 2,236 
Granted 4,981 741 
Issued (5,101) (610)
Canceled/forfeited/adjusted (756) (55)
Shares at January 2, 2022 14,122 2,312 
The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $152.62, $139.58 and $121.31 in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, using the
fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units
during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $611 million, $650 million and $586 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.
The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $179.35, $160.54 and $124.67 in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,
calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date of grant. 
The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value
of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value
for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The
fair value of performance share units issued was $83 million, $91 million and $119 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.(1)

18.Acquisitions and Divestitures
During fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions.
During fiscal year 2020, certain businesses were acquired for $7.3 billion in cash and $0.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were
accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates
of acquisition.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $7.5 billion and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
The fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological
indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and
develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases and the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data
science capabilities.
During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has
multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $0.8 billion. The fair value of the acquisition
was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $0.8 billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from
20% to 60% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately
16%. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted
for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year 2021, additional information
regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The
Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset,
bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment charge is related to the
AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights
to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020.
Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with
significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business
combination and included in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets,
primarily IPR&D, for $0.4 billion, goodwill for $0.2 billion, other assets of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.3 billion. The fair value of the
Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $0.4 billion.
On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The
fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets (IPR&D) of $6.0 billion, goodwill of $1.2 billion, other assets of
$0.5 billion and liabilities of $1.6 billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-
inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success factors ranging from 20%
to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was
approximately 13%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.
During fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $5.8 billion in cash and $1.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were
accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates
of acquisition.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $6.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
The fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a
broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health, Inc. a(6)
84
privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
On January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad
range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥230 billion, which equates to approximately $2.1
billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the
Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity
investment in DR. CI:LABO.
The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment. During the fiscal first quarter of
2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets
for $1.5 billion, goodwill for $1.2 billion and liabilities of $0.4 billion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer
relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition
and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
On April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional
contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately
held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with a U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of
the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $3.0 billion, goodwill for $2.0 billion,
marketable securities of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above. The
goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. During
the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of
approximately $1.1 billion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain developmental and commercial milestones,
which are not expected to be met based on the Company’s current timelines. During the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial
IPR&D impairment charge of $0.1 billion related to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. In the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the
Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform
(Ottava). A probability of success factor ranging from 18% to 66% across Ottava sub-platforms, was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent
regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 9.5%.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma
information for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Divestitures
During fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Pharmaceutical segment. The Company
recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.6 billion.
During fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the company at that time. The
transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 million ($357 million) based on a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and resulted in an
immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had rights to approximately 38.7 million shares through a convertible loan with a principal
amount of CHF 445 million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110 million ($120 million) of this loan into
approximately 9.6 million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022. During the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's
undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.
During fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $2.8 billion,
consisting of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $0.1 billion of retained net receivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income)
expense, net, of approximately $2.0 billion.
19.Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial;
indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their
business. Due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company continues to monitor its
legal proceedings as the situation evolves and in person trials resume.
85
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are
probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust
accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and
regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss
beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be
affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and
legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in
dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-
party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards,
judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can
be reasonably estimated.
In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in
these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible
to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a
variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on
currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each
matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as
estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of
claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as
additional information becomes available.
The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE
Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; XARELTO; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder;
INVOKANA; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESHFlexible Composite Mesh. As of January 2, 2022, in the United States there were approximately 250
plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip
Resurfacing System; 5,300 with respect to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; 10,100 with respect to pelvic meshes; 8,800 with respect to
RISPERDAL; 5,500 with respect to XARELTO; 40,400 with respect to body powders containing talc; 100 with respect to INVOKANA;and 4,700 with
respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or
dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed.
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip
Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. Cases
filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India
and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a
program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of
August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip
patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims,
thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement
program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority
of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company
continues to receive information with respect to potential additional®

costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement
program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the
PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive
information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a
multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation also has been filed in some state courts and in
countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for
retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program,
adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular
Cup System and the related settlement program.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to
treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional
cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the
jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has
settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are
reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting
from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding
its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market
assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March
2020, the Court issued a decision and entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company appealed the decision to the intermediate
appellate court, the Full Court. The appeal was heard in February 2021 and, in March 2021, the Full Court entered a judgment dismissing the appeal. An
application for special leave to the High Court of Australia was filed in April 2021, and the High Court heard oral argument on the application in
November 2021. Special leave was refused. While this brings an end to the appellate process, there will now be an individual case assessment process for
the remaining group member claims. The parties currently are in discussions with the Court to determine the form and mechanism of that individual case
assessment process. The next hearing is scheduled for late February 2022. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement
of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently
negotiating the wording and some of the terms thereof and once finalized, the settlement will be subject to court approval. The parties are due to update the
court on the status of the finalization of the settlement negotiations by the end of February 2022. The Company has established accruals with respect to
product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.
Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh), claims for personal injury
have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases
filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in
New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., one multi-plaintiff lawsuit pending in
Oklahoma state court and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to
resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement
agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings
are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. The deadline for issuance of Individual Allocation amounts by the Special Master
is March 2022. The costs associated with this proposed settlement are reflected in the Company’s accruals. Post-Settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL
and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of February 2022, there are approximately 90
active cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.
Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral
Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL
in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the
United States. Discovery is underway in the MCL proceedings.®
®
®

87
Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System. In
January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have
also been filed in other federal and state courts in the United States.
The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESHFlexible Composite Mesh,
PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System products.
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL, and
related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated
with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the
United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs
and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company,
including a verdict in October 2019 of $8.0 billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $6.8 million in January
2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all
of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.
Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI);
Johnson & Johnson; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer Healthcare AG, and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases
have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and Johnson &
Johnson announced an agreement in principle to settle the XARELTO cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the
settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United
States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO related product liability
litigation.
A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson &
Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed
in state and federal courts in the United States as well as outside of the United States, continued to increase through fiscal year 2021.
In talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the
Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018
verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. An application for
transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham
decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately
$2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims
brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed.
Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.
In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of
that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company
(LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct
parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely
responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained
or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or
injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).
In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL
Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI.
On November 15, 2021, the North®

Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and
prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance
companies, and certain other parties. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in
November 2021, and that court subsequently extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL
Bankruptcy Case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. While
the PI effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-related personal injury litigation, LTL has agreed to lift the automatic stay on a small number of appeals
where appeal bonds have been filed.
The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the
establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with
the aforementioned trust. Subsequent to the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party, as a result of the
bankruptcy filing. The impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters
related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings,
the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.
In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc.
(collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum
powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance
proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR)
(collectively, the Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto. The Plan Proponents have
since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021,
and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. In March 2021, the
Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April 2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received
the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought
to disqualify those votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn as improperly voted. In October
2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, and certain of Imerys’s insurers (the Mediation Parties) have since
agreed to engage in mediation.
In July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys adversary proceeding). The Imerys
adversary proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with respect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to
Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from
undergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The
Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021,
the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy
Case should apply to the Imerys adversary proceeding.
In June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (together, Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding
against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus
adversary proceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In February 2021,
Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan. The Plan contemplates a
settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for
an injunction against Talc Claims asserted against it. Cyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC
and FCR appointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October 2021, the Company
filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should
apply to the Cyprus adversary proceeding.
In February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the Coverage Action) filed a motion in the
Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the automatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking
relief from the automatic stay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a limited
response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying the stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage
Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the
filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action.

In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in
body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.
Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In
December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on
Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was completed. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s
motion for class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement the class certification record,
and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. Discovery is ongoing.
In June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August
2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the
Court heard oral argument. In February 2022, the Court granted Johnson & Johnson's cross motion to dismiss. In October 2019, December 2019, and
January 2020, four shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and
certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged
asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’SBaby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a
result of those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson & Johnson Talc
Stockholder Derivative Litigation. In July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board
to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues and demanding
that suit be brought against certain Directors. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in the In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder
Derivative Litigation. The independent counsel recommended that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or
appropriate to secure dismissal of the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In
October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In
March 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery. The Court temporarily terminated Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss pending a decision on
Plaintiff’s motion for discovery. In November 2021, at the Court’s request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for discovery.
In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its
Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants
breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do
so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are
seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but
granted leave to amend. In June 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of
October 2020, briefing on Defendants’ motion was complete. In February 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion, and granted Plaintiffs leave to
amend. In April 2021, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they did not intend to file an amended complaint, and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice.
In May 2021, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Third Circuit. In July 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in the Third Circuit and in September
2021, Defendants filed their response brief, and in October 2021, Plaintiffs filed their reply brief. In January 2022, the Third Circuit heard oral argument.
A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging violations of California’s Consumer
Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by
failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the
second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended
complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In
April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated
that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company
moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order
and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the
Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its responsive brief in October 2021. In October 2021, Notice of
Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit. A bankruptcy stay was imposed in December 2021, and the Court held the reply deadline in
abeyance.
In addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc matters, including from Senator Murray, a
member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice, the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer
Policy of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, the Senate®

Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson &
Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA, a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In
December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be
filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or
otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company’s
accruals.

the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals
for defense costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual
property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products
and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial
defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in
any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,
require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant
matters are described below.
Medical Devices
In December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) in United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging that

and that he is the true owner of Acclarent’s U.S. Patent No. 8,414,473. Trial began in October 2021, and shortly thereafter, the parties reached an agreement
to settle the case. Plaintiff’s motion to dismiss with prejudice was filed in October 2021. The case was dismissed with prejudice in November 2021.
In August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc. (collectively, Intuitive) filed a patent infringement suit against Auris Health,

Monarch™ Platform. Auris filed IPR Petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) regarding the ’200, ’056, ’601 ’701, ’447, ’276 and
’906 patents. Intuitive subsequently dropped the ’200, ’473 and ’701 patents from the suit. In December 2019, the USPTO instituted review of the ’601
patent and denied review of the ’056 patent. In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the ’200, ’447, ’701 and ’906 patents and denied
review of the ’276 patent. In December 2020, the USPTO declared all of the challenged claims in the ’601 patent to be invalid. Intuitive has appealed that
decision. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the ’447 and ’906 patents are not invalid. Auris has appealed that decision. Auris

Pharmaceutical
Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)
The following summarizes lawsuits the Company’s subsidiaries have brought against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA or
undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson &
Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and
invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs
expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA,
to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s
subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market
prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also
being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer health and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject
to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has
been the basis of government investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government
agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government
investigations or litigation.
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were
named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical
products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average
Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in
these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on® 
®
®
®
®
®
® 
® 
®
®
® 
®
95
AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state
actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after
trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen
Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved.
Opioid Litigation
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies,
have been named in approximately 3,400 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The
suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco,
Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been
filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal
Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and
JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the
manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New
York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There
are over 380 cases pending in various state courts. There are close to 3,000 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against Johnson & Johnson and its
Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf
of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against Johnson &
Johnson and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First
Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL.
These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer
fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief
and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could
result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable
remedies and other sanctions.
In 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of
$465 million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment.
In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. In April 2021,
three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California state court against Johnson & Johnson and JPI, and other affiliates, as
well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers. The trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a final trial judgment in
favor of Defendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs' motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied.
In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for
documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to
be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In
September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide
inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums. In September 2020, the Company learned that NYDFS filed a
statement of charges related to this investigation.
In June 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of New York and its participating subdivisions, including Nassau
County and Suffolk County, resolving their opioid-related claims against the Company on terms consistent with the Company’s previously announced
agreement in principle to contribute up to $5 billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The
settlement provides New York and its participating subdivisions with up to $263 million to address opioid-related issues, reimburses attorney fees and
costs, and removes the® ® ®
96
Company and Janssen from a multi-defendant trial of opioid-related claims that commenced in Suffolk County in June 2021. In exchange, the Company
and JPI receive releases from the claims asserted by New York and the participating parties, including NYDFS.
In October 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of Texas and its participating subdivisions, including Dallas
County, Bexar County, and Tarrant County, resolving their opioid-related claims against the Company on terms consistent with the Company’s previously
announced agreement to contribute up to $5 billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The
settlement provides Texas and its participating subdivisions with up to $297 million to address opioid-related issues and reimburse attorney fees and costs,
and removes the Company and Janssen from multi-defendant bellwether trials of opioid-related claims scheduled to commence in Texas state courts in
early 2022. In exchange, the Company and JPI will receive releases from the claims asserted by Texas and the participating subdivisions.
Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing
practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In
September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states
regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the
Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in
settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion
which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or
wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims have been finalized and up to
one-third of the all-in settlement is expected to be paid within the next 12 months, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their
subdivisions. The terms provide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the
participating states to opt-in. As of January 2022, 45 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia had elected to participate in the settlement. The
subdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole
discretion, there is insufficient participation. Based on expected participation, the Company has committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five
of the participating states (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments, whose cases were scheduled for trial in 2021,
2022, or 2023.
From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary
duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020,
independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary
or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s
report.
In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and
certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties
related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In May 2020, the shareholder
filed an amended complaint challenging the Board’s rejection of his demand. In August 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the amended
complaint. In February 2021, the Court held oral argument on Johnson & Johnson’s motion. In February 2022, the Court granted Johnson & Johnson’s
motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In August 2020, another shareholder who sent a demand filed a separate derivative complaint in the same court
making similar allegations. In October 2020, the Court granted defendants’ request to reassign the second-filed case to the division where the first-filed
case is pending.
In December 2019, two additional shareholders who sent demands filed two separate derivative complaints making similar allegations against Johnson &
Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the United States District for the District of New
Jersey. In April 2020, the two federal cases were consolidated into a single action captioned In re Johnson & Johnson Opioid Stockholder Derivative
Litigation. In July 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint. In September 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated
complaint, and in December 2020, the shareholders opposed Johnson & Johnson’s motion. Johnson & Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July
2020, an additional shareholder who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same
defendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the third case was consolidated into the
consolidated action. In February 2021, the Court granted the shareholders motion to voluntarily dismiss the consolidated action without prejudice, and the
shareholders’ counsel then filed a notice of association in the first-filed derivative action pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey.

Other
In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy)
received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States
notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False
Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with
prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators
appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal in part,
reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike
and dismiss the relators’ second amended complaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for
reconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s motion for reconsideration and dismissed
the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in December 2021. The Relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January
2022 omnibus motion for reconsideration. Following the District Court’s order dismissing the case with prejudice, DePuy filed a December 2021 motion
seeking the recovery of attorneys’ fees.
In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General’s office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of
the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May
2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer
protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by the following states: Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oregon. In April
2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. In
October 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In January 2020, the
Court in California issued a statement of decision, finding in favor of the State of California, and awarded civil penalties in the amount of $344 million. In
April 2020, the Court in California denied the Company’s motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties
of $344 million, but denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company is appealing the penalty judgment. In April 2020, the
Company settled the West Virginia case. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon. Trial in the Kentucky matter is
scheduled for May 2023.
In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against
Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The
complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’
use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary
relief. Johnson & Johnson and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State’s claim was barred by preemption, which the trial court
denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted Johnson & Johnson and JJCI’s request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for
summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court rejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and
remanded the matter to the trial court. Thereafter, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI objected to any trial setting due to the LTL Bankruptcy and that
any decision on whether the stay applied should be deferred to the LTL Bankruptcy court. The State opposed any stay and argued that the trial court should
decide issues concerning the stay. The motion for trial setting and JJCI’s objections were heard in November 2021 and in January 2022, the Court granted
plaintiff’s motion for trial setting and directed the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. That process is underway. In August
2021, JJCI filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Court’s ruling of April 2021, the State
responded to the Petition for Writ of Certiorari in November 2021, the JJCI filed a reply in November 2021, and the United States Supreme Court denied

State of California by restricting competition in the sale of High Density Mapping Catheters and Ultrasound Catheters. In January 2020, BWI filed a
motion to dismiss the complaint. In August 2020, the Court granted in part and denied in part BWI’s motion to dismiss. In December 2021, BWI filed a
motion for summary judgment. The trial is set for April 2022.
In November 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a demand for indemnification from Pfizer Inc., pursuant to the 2006 Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement

Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., pursuant to the 2006 Asset Purchase Agreement among the Company, Pfizer, and Boehringer Ingelheim. The
notices seek indemnification for legal claims related to over-the-counter ZANTAC (ranitidine) products. Plaintiffs in the underlying actions allege that
ZANTAC and other over-the-counter ranitidine medications contain unsafe levels of NDMA (N-nitrosodimethylamine) and can cause and/or have caused
various cancers in patients using the products, and seek injunctive and monetary relief.
In October 2020, Fortis Advisors LLC (Fortis), in its capacity as representative of the former stockholders of Auris Health Inc. (Auris), filed a complaint
against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon Inc., and certain named officers and employees (collectively, Ethicon) in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware. The complaint alleges breach of contract, fraud, and other causes of action against Ethicon in connection with Ethicon’s acquisition of Auris in
2019. The complaint seeks damages and other relief. In December 2021, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss certain
causes of action. All claims against the individual defendants were dismissed.
Beginning in May 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts (California, Florida, New York, and New Jersey) against
various Johnson & Johnson entities alleging violations of state consumer fraud statutes based on nondisclosure of alleged benzene contamination of certain
Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreen products and the affirmative promotion of those products as “safe”; and, in at least one case, alleging a strict liability
manufacturing defect and failure to warn claims, asserting that the named plaintiffs suffered unspecified injuries as a result of alleged exposure to benzene.
The Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation has consolidated all pending actions, except one product liability case and one case pending in New Jersey
state court, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Fort Lauderdale Division. In October 2021, the Company reached an
agreement in principle for the settlement of a nationwide class, encompassing the claims of the consolidated actions, subject to approval by the Florida
federal Court. In December 2021, plaintiffs in the consolidated actions filed a motion for preliminary approval of a nationwide class settlement.
Johnson & Johnson (subsequently substituted by Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (JJCI)) along with more than 120 other companies, is a defendant in a
cost recovery and contribution action brought by Occidental Chemical Corporation in June 2018 in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey, related to the clean-up of a section of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey.
Johnson & Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost
of past and/or future remediation.®

20. Restructuring
In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to
focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio,
enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce
complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a pre-
tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in
other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the
restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program.
In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that
will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax
restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network
optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.   
The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2021: 
(Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs/Sales Other Total
Reserve balance, December 29, 2019 $ 164 — 16 180 
2020 activity (29) — (7) (36)
Reserve balance, January 3, 2021 135 — 9 144 
Current year activity:
   Charges — 53 420 473 
   Cash settlements (23) (404) (427)
   Settled non cash — (53) (53)
Reserve balance, January 2, 2022 $ 112 — 25 137 
 Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next year in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws.
 Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses.
The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates
regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans
given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts
become probable and estimable.(2)

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 2, 2022 and
January 3, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended January 2, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have
audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2,
2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
 
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or
103
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a
contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a
reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance
sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care,
Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion as of January 2, 2022. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed
Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience,
patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare
and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing
these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to
contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care,
Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i)
developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market,
the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed
by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and
(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.
Litigation Contingencies – Talc
As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters,
including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards,
judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can
be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts
accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among
other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not
complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the
uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-
claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to
contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances
the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson,
implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related
liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking
relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all
litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary
Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson,
other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL
bankruptcy case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. The
Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment
of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the
aforementioned trust. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various
scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or
range of loss beyond the amount accrued.
104
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant
judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range
of loss for the future and existing talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing
procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including
controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures.
These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc
litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-
house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external
legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is
reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.
Litigation – Opioids
As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters,
including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards,
judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can
be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts
accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among
other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts
in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive
multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has been named
in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments, including tribal governments, related to opioids matters. In October 2019, the
Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of the matters. In October 2020,
the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by
states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the
state and subdivision claims have been finalized, depending upon the level of participation by the various parties. The terms provide a period of time for
states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. The subdivision opt-in period
expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is insufficient
participation.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant
judgment by management when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss for the agreement to settle the opioids litigation can be
made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of
the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including
controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures.
These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the opioids
litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house
legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal
counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably
possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022. In
making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness
of its internal controls over financial reporting.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 2, 2022, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief
Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
    Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to “Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”, and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the “Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” included in Item 8 of this Report.
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  During the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not
experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of its employees have worked remotely due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring
controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
    The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human
resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s
financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and
operation of its financial control environment.
