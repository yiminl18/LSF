PART I.
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Salesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology that brings companies and their customers together. Founded in 1999,
we enable companies of every size and industry to take advantage of powerful technologies to connect to their customers in a whole new way and help them
transform their businesses around the customer in this digital-first world.
Our Customer 360 platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a
complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized
experiences across every channel and increase productivity. With Slack, we provide a digital headquarters where companies, employees, governments and
stakeholders can collaborate to create success from anywhere.
Our Customer 360 service offerings are designed to be flexible, scalable and easy to use. They can generally be configured easily, deployed rapidly and
integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications. We sell to businesses worldwide, primarily on a subscription basis, through our direct sales efforts and
also indirectly through partners. We also enable third parties to use our platform and developer tools to create additional functionality and new applications that run
on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service offerings.
Salesforce is committed to a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability. Foremost among these is trust, which is the
foundation for everything we do. Our customers trust our technology to deliver the highest levels of security, privacy, performance, compliance and availability at
scale. Customer success is at the core of our business and we align the entire company around our customers’ needs to ensure their success and prove our value. We
believe in continuous innovation, enabling our customers to access the latest technology advances so they can innovate and stay ahead in their industries. Equality is
a core tenet of how we run our business. We value the equality of every individual at our company and in our communities. We believe that creating a diverse
workplace that reflects the communities we serve and fostering an inclusive culture where everyone feels seen, heard and valued makes us a better company. Finally,
we believe the world is in a climate crisis and that sustainability, including bold climate action, is the only way forward. We are committed to ambitious climate
leadership solutions, and we're bringing the full power of Salesforce to help organizations achieve net zero emissions.
We believe that our values create value, and the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including stockholders,
customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. Salesforce is committed to giving back to our communities, closing the
inequality gap and helping businesses grow while protecting the environment for future generations. We believe we have a broad responsibility to society, and we
aspire to create a framework for the ethical and humane use of technology that not only drives the success of our customers, but also upholds the basic human rights
of every individual. We are committed to transparent environmental, social and governance disclosures and maintaining programs that support the success of these
initiatives.

Our Business and Growth Strategy
We continue to expand in the growing addressable markets across all of our service offerings, providing additional opportunities for growth in our business and
results. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and
international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. We orient our business strategy and invest for future growth by
focusing on the following key priorities:
Expand relationships with existing customers. We see significant opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships through cross-selling and upselling
our service offerings. For example, we continue to focus on driving multiple service offering adoption, which provides our customers with a one-stop-shop for their
front-office business technology needs. As our customers realize the benefits of our entire suite of service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customers’ experience
with new products and features, and gain additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units. Finally, we aim to expand our relationships
with existing customers through our additional support offerings.
Increase geographic reach. By extending our go-to-market capabilities globally, we aim to grow our business by selling to new customers in new regions. We
will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in most major markets globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We also plan to continue to develop indirect
distribution channels for our solutions around the globe and new go-to-market strategies. We continue to invest in our domestic and international operations and
infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world.
Focus on industries and new products. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative and value-driven solutions in new categories based on
our existing and potential customers’ needs. For example, we provide out-of-the-box solutions specifically built for customers in certain industries, such as financial
services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing and more. In addition, through direct discussions and strategic engagements with our customers, we are able to
deliver the innovations and enhancements that align with the needs of our customers. As a result of customer feedback, in fiscal 2023 we developed Genie, which
allows our customers to ingest, transform, harmonize, unify and visualize data across all of our industry solutions in real time.
Leverage our partner ecosystem. The Customer 360 Platform enables customers, independent software vendors (“ISVs”) and third-party developers to
create, test and deliver cloud-based apps. These apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by software
vendors. In addition, we rely on our consulting partners to deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, from large-scale implementations to more limited
solutions that help businesses run more efficiently. We continue to work with and invest in our partner ecosystem, including these ISVs and system integrators
(“SIs”), to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries.
Promote strong customer adoption and reduce customer attrition. We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies
transform successfully. Our customer success programs, including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists,
help enable and accelerate our customers’ digital transformations. In addition, we have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies learn our systems
and a
7
Table of Contents
community of Trailblazers who drive innovation. With these programs and resources, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer
subscriptions.
Mergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
We evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to complement our organic
innovation and advance the development of our Customer 360 Platform. Our evaluation seeks to ensure that any potential acquisition accelerates our Customer 360
strategy, and represents an attractive customer opportunity, there is a way to effectively monetize the acquired products and drive significant operational efficiencies
and there is a clear timeline for value accretion. Our acquisitions can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and
accelerate development of features to large-scale acquisitions that result in new service offerings. Our goal is to prioritize the use of our balance sheet, through cash
and debt, to complete acquisitions without diluting shareholders. Our Board of Directors’ Mergers and Acquisitions Committee, which oversaw risks related to
mergers, acquisitions and investments, including with respect to the integration of acquired technology and employees, was dissolved effective as of March 1, 2023.
We also manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies,
technology startups and system integrators. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company’s
initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our
solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find
attractive, including investments in companies representing targeted geographies, businesses and technological initiatives. Our strategy includes growing our
strategic investment portfolio, in part, by reinvesting proceeds from the sales of strategic investments.
Technology, Development and Operations
We primarily deliver our Salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture.
Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants
who run in virtual isolation from each other. This approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster
than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality and enhancing existing offerings.
We have historically provided and continue to provide our services to our customers from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-
party data center facilities. In combination with these third-party data center facilities, we also provide our services via cloud computing platform partners who offer
Infrastructure-as-a-Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking. We continue to invest and expand the deployment of Hyperforce, which allows our
platform and applications to be delivered rapidly and reliably to locations worldwide, giving our customers autonomy and control over data residency.
Our technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing
service offerings, as well as developing new features, functionality and services. We also remain focused on integrating businesses, services and technologies from
acquisitions, including our most recent acquisitions of Slack, Tableau and MuleSoft. Performance, functional depth, security, usability, ease of integration and
configuration and sustainability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction.
Competition
The market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology with low barriers to entry,
shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Our current competitors include:
•internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers’ IT departments);
•vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software
application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;
•software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium
for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization;
•vendors who offer software tailored to specific services, as opposed to our full suite of service offerings including suppliers of traditional business
intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors or e-commerce solutions vendors;
•productivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software
market; and
8
Table of Contents
•traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products
that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services.
We believe more companies may become competitive threats due to the accelerated shift to cloud and hosted service offerings and customer experience
management solutions. We also expect our competition to change and evolve as we expand into more markets, with new offerings.
Customers
We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to
hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal years 2023, 2022 or 2021. In addition, we do not have
any material dependencies on any specific product, service or particular group or groups.
Customer Service and Support
We offer professional services to help customers achieve business results faster with Salesforce solutions. Our architects and innovation program teams act as
advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers. This includes implementation services for multi-cloud and complex deployments. We provide
best-practices and AI-based recommendations and adoption programs globally. In addition, we provide advanced education, including in-person and online courses,
to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our service offerings.
Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social
networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying
subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium success offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include
services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support and system administration. In addition, we offer a premier priority support add-on that
includes proactive monitoring, rapid incidence response and instruction from a dedicated support team knowledgeable about the customer's specific enterprise
architecture.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which comprises telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, field sales personnel based in
territories close to their customers and self-service offerings.
To a lesser extent, we also utilize a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and assist in selling to these prospects. This network includes global
consulting firms, systems integrators and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the
customers whom they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription services.
We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We
focus our marketing activities in the cities and countries with the largest market opportunities. Our primary marketing activities include:
•multichannel marketing campaigns that span email, social media, the web, television and more, which align to a broader customer journey;

Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and patents and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brands.
We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services,
documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also
purchase or

license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a
strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting open source software or attracting and enabling our external
development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we
believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.
Human Capital Management
Salesforce is committed to a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability. These core values are the foundation of our
company culture, which we believe is fundamental to, and a competitive advantage in, our approach to managing our workforce. We believe our company culture
fosters open dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family, all of which allow us to attract and retain the best talent, which is critical for our continued
success. For example, our sales, engineering and customer success teams are critical to our ability to grow, innovate and ensure the trust and customer success of our
customers.
We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective. Our focus on our workplace environment and a strong company culture has led to
recognition across the globe, as evidenced by the following awards: Fortune World's Most Admired Companies (2022 and for the eighth year in a row), Fortune 100
Best Companies to Work For (2022 and for the 13th year in a row), Human Rights Campaign Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality (2022) and Glassdoor
Employees' Choice Best Place to Work in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States (2022).
As of January 31, 2023, we had 79,390 employees, of which approximately 52 percent were located in the United States and 48 percent were located
internationally and approximately 36 percent identified as women, 63 percent identified as men and less than 0.2 percent identified as non-binary. This number
includes those individuals impacted by our restructuring plan announced on January 4, 2023, which includes a reduction of our current workforce by approximately
10 percent. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. However, employees of certain foreign subsidiaries are represented by
works councils.
We have continued to invest in equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives, development programs, employee engagement and ongoing communications and
feedback. Some of our key human capital management initiatives are summarized below:
Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
Equality is a core value at Salesforce. We aim to create a workplace that reflects the diverse communities we serve and empowers our employees. Our key
equality initiatives include: Racial Equality and Justice Task Force, a diversity recruiting team dedicated to sourcing talent from Underrepresented Minority (URM)
communities, a newly instituted URM referral process, Black Women Experience program, Warmline employee advocacy resource and Equality Mentorship and
Sponsorship programs, investing in our future leaders, inclusive hiring and leadership trainings, equal pay for equal work, employee-led resource groups and a focus
on accessibility in our products and workspaces. For example:
•We aspired to have 50 percent of our U.S. workforce made up of underrepresented groups for the U.S. technology industry (“underrepresented groups”),
which we define as employees who identify as Women, Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Multiracial, Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, Trans, Queer, People with
Disabilities and Veterans, by fiscal 2024. As of January 31, 2023, we achieved that goal as approximately 52 percent of our U.S. workforce was made up of
these underrepresented groups.
•We published our latest representation goal to reach 40 percent women identifying and non-binary employees globally by the end of 2026. As of January 31,
2023, approximately 37 percent of our global workforce was made up of women and non-binary employees.
•To align and accelerate our equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives, beginning in fiscal 2023 all executive vice presidents, presidents and executive
officers had a component of their incentive compensation plans tied to employee diversity measures.
Talent and Career Development
We offer our employees various talent development programs to create a culture of continuous learning. Learning and development opportunities include
Trailhead, our learning platform available for all employees, in-person and virtual classes, guides and workbooks and more. For example, the Great Leader Pathways
program is designed to support leadership development at scale to meet current and future needs of the business. In fiscal 2023, approximately 24,000 employees
enrolled in Great Leader Pathways. We also encourage our employees to seek personal and professional development opportunities with external organizations and
offer yearly education reimbursement to employees who wish to continue job-related education from accredited institutions or organizations.

Total Rewards
We believe offering competitive compensation packages and robust benefits is an important factor in our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees
and to help enhance their everyday wellbeing. We use a combination of fixed and variable cash compensation for all employees and award equity compensation to
certain employees in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units. Eligible employees are also able to participate in
our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows employees to purchase our stock at a 15 percent discount up to U.S. Internal Revenue Code limits. We also match
up to $5,000 of donations, per employee, to eligible nonprofit organizations. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed
local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace.
Our V2MOM and Code of Conduct
Alignment and consistent and clear communication are a key part of our employee engagement, especially as we continue to grow. Each year, we complete a
corporate V2MOM, which is an internal management tool used to align the Company on our vision, values, methods, obstacles and measures for the upcoming year.
All employees are then expected to complete their own V2MOM that aligns with the corporate V2MOM. In addition, our Code of Conduct ensures that our core
values remain the foundation of the Company and directly impact our ability to deliver success. We expect all of our employees to commit to acting with integrity
and treating others with compassion and respect.
Employee Engagement & Satisfaction
Our leadership strives for active and frequent engagement with our employees through frequent company all hands meetings and The Daily, our daily
communication allowing employees to be connected with the business in real time. Our Employee Opinion Survey is a vehicle for employees to provide confidential
feedback on their experience as Salesforce employees. The results are used to assess employee engagement, our company culture and our workplace environment.
Based on the results of the most recent survey, 93 percent of responding employees indicated they were willing to give extra effort to get the job done and 90 percent
of responding employees indicated that they feel a sense of pride working at Salesforce.

Operational and Execution Risks
If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the
underlying infrastructure of the Internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized
access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant
reputational harm, legal exposure and liabilities, or a negative financial impact.
Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial,
health and other personal information. We can provide no assurances that our security measures designed to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’
data will be effective. Our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following:
•third-party attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or customers to disclose sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other
information to gain access to our customers’ data or IT systems, or our data or our IT systems;
•efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, to launch coordinated
attacks, including ransomware, destructive malware and distributed denial-of-service attacks;
•third-party attempts to abuse our marketing, advertising, messaging or social products and functionalities to impersonate persons or organizations and
disseminate information that is false, misleading or malicious;
•cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate, or on third-party cloud-computing platform providers;
•vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings;
•vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on;
•vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired companies;
•attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet that our products depend on, most of which are
not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners or customers; and
•employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems.
These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal
security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. Our Board of Directors, Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee and
executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as updates on cybersecurity
events. We can provide no assurances that our implemented systems and processes designed to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and
other sensitive data will provide absolute security or otherwise be effective or that a material breach will not occur. For example, our ability to mitigate these risks
may be impacted by the following:
•frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure,
which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to
prevent such techniques;
•the continued evolution of our internal IT systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with
partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems;
•the acquisition of new companies, requiring us to incorporate and secure different or more complex IT environments;
•authorization by our customers to third-party technology providers to access their customer data, which may lead to our customers’ inability to protect their
data that is stored on our servers; and
•our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not
allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.
In the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts and have experienced other security incidents. Although, to
date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact,
there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. Additionally, as our market presence grows, we may face increased risks of
cyberattack attempts or security threats.

A security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our IT systems or data, or our
customers’ systems or data, including intellectual property and proprietary, sensitive or other confidential information. A security breach could also result in a loss of
confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance
premiums and legal, regulatory and financial exposure and liability. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities,
including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs, such as additional
infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities.
For example, in April 2022, we learned a threat actor had obtained unauthorized access to several databases on Heroku, a Salesforce platform-as-a-service. The
threat actor downloaded stored customer security credentials and passwords for logging into GitHub, a third-party code hosting service used by both Heroku and
Heroku customers. The threat actor also was able to download passwords for a subset of customer user accounts and access the encryption key. While we do not
believe this incident materially affected our business or financial results, there is no assurance that such circumstances or other similar incidents in the future could
not result in a material adverse effect on our business.
Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.
Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software, third-party and open-source software, our services may have
errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Our customers may also use our
services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. Cloud services frequently contain
undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We may also encounter difficulties integrating acquired technologies
into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. As a result, our services may
have errors or defects resulting from the complexities of integrating acquisitions.
We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. Such defects
could be the result of employee, contractor or other third-party acts or inaction, and could negatively affect our brand and reputation. We have experienced and may
in the future experience defects in our products that created vulnerabilities that inadvertently permitted access to protected customer data. For example, in December
2021, a vulnerability in a widely-used open-source software application, known as Apache Log4j, was identified that could have allowed bad actors to remotely
access a target, potentially stealing data or taking control of a target’s system. While this issue did not materially affect our business, reputation or financial results,
there is no assurance that such circumstances or other incidents could not occur in the future that have a material adverse effect on our business or subject us to
substantial liability. Vulnerabilities in open source or any proprietary or third-party product can persist even after security patches have been issued if customers have
not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching was complete. In some cases, vulnerabilities may not be
immediately detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to damaged assets.
Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could
hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We
could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an
increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.
Any interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware
and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the
delivery of our services and harm our business.
We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other
countries. We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to
offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally,
including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services and harm our business. We have from time to time
experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and continues to disrupt the supply
chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business, which affects our and our suppliers’ operations. In addition, supply chain
disruptions due to geopolitical developments in Europe and indirect effects have further complicated existing supply chain constraints. As we increase our reliance
on these third-party systems, particularly with respect to third-party cloud computing platforms, our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase.
Interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their
subscriptions, and adversely affect
14
Table of Contents
our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our
customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.
For many of our offerings, our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near real time in a separate facility located elsewhere. Certain
offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the
operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures
and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of destruction or vandalism or similar misconduct, as well as local administrative
actions (including shelter-in-place or similar orders), changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. In addition, supply
chain disruptions due to geopolitical developments in Europe may also lead to power disruptions in regions where our facilities are located. Despite precautions
taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or risks, or a natural disaster or
public health emergency, an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems or operational failures at these
facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services, and no assurance can be provided that any such interruptions would be remediated without significant
cost or in a timely manner or at all.
The hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms that we rely on may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable
terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software, data or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and disrupt
or otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through
purchase or license and integrated into our services, and no assurance can be provided that such equivalent technology would be developed or obtained in a timely
manner or at all.
If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could
experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our reputation and business. As
we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we move or transfer our data and our customers’ data from time to
time. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.
As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove
difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.
As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies
and intellectual property rights. We continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future.
Acquisitions and other transactions, arrangements and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures,
including:
•potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all;
•potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the
product into our service offerings;
•difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services, and related costs;
•difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent
basis;
•augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation;
•brand or reputational harm associated with our strategic investments or acquired companies;
•challenges converting the acquired company’s revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues, including subscription-based revenues and
software license revenue, as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables;
•division of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;
•challenges entering into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;
•currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new
markets;
•difficulties and strain on resources in integrating acquired operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;
15
Table of Contents
•regulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay or impose conditions (such as divestitures, ownership or
operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the completion of transactions or the integration of acquired operations;
•failure to fully assimilate, integrate or retrain acquired employees, which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our
existing key employees or disruption to existing teams;
•differences between our values and those of our acquired companies, as well as disruptions to our workplace culture;
•inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;
•challenges with the acquired company’s customers and partners, including the inability to maintain such relationships and changes to perception of the
acquired business as a result of the acquisition;
•challenges with the acquired company’s third-party service providers, including those that are required for ongoing access to third-party data;
•potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products;
•unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology;
•known and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, including due to litigation;
•difficulties in managing, or potential write-offs of, acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired
customers;
•negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets , fixed assets and operating lease
right-of-use assets;
•the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue;
•challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a
joint venture or other majority ownership investments;
•difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure;
•additional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition, including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of
operations;
•delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;
•ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;
•in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages, cultures and political
environments; and
•the tax effects of any such acquisitions including related integration and business operation changes, and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our
future tax assets or liabilities.
Any of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, to facilitate acquisitions or investments, we may seek
additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or
investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt
securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence
of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock.
Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may be impaired by trade
tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions and investments in the technology sector. For example, several countries, including the
United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions of varying kinds on transactions involving foreign
investments and acquisitions. Antitrust authorities in a number of countries have also reviewed acquisitions and investments in the technology industry with
increased scrutiny. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, some of which may apply to acquisitions, investments or integrations of
businesses by us, and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results.
Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations
and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.
We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, including through acquisitions, which has placed a strain on and in the future
may stress the capabilities of our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that significant additional investments,
including in human capital software, will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and
enhance our
16
Table of Contents
services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will
make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. We may not be able to make these investments as quickly
or effectively as necessary to successfully scale our operations.
We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter
unforeseen problems with our new systems and processes or in migrating away from our existing systems and processes, our operations and our ability to manage
our business could be negatively impacted. For example, our efforts to further automate our processes for customer contracts may be complicated by unanticipated
operating difficulties.
Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase
the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. Additionally, changes in our work environment and workforce in
the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our operations. In particular, although most of our offices have reopened, we have offered a significant
percentage of our employees the flexibility in the amount of time they work in an office. Our new office model and any adjustments made to our current and future
office environments or work-from-home policies, including changes from the restructuring plan announced in January 2023, may not meet the needs and
expectations of our workforce, which could negatively impact our ability to increase productivity of our existing workforce and to attract and retain our employees.
To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and
management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase
productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue
and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade
rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12
to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew
for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base and the number of
multi-year subscription contracts. Historically, our subscription and support revenues primarily consisted of subscription fees; however, with the acquisitions of
MuleSoft and Tableau, subscription and support revenues also now include term software license sales. We have less experience forecasting the renewal rates of such
term software license sales. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of various factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers’
spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general
economic conditions.
Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our
current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our
customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and customer receptiveness to any price
changes related to these additional features and services.
If customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, we may not meet our
revenue targets and our business could be harmed, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.
We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product
introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Such sales
organization changes have in some periods resulted in, and may in the future result in, a reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth
in the current and future quarters and operating results, including revenue. For example, the restructuring plan we announced in January 2023 involved such changes
to our sales organization, which could negatively impact our productivity, growth rate and operating results, which may adversely affect the market price of our
common stock. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue
growth.

Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties.
The Internet’s infrastructure comprises many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. This infrastructure is run by
a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (“ICANN”) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, now under the stewardship of ICANN.
The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related
cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future, potentially reducing the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our
Internet-based services. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing
customers and harm our business.
In addition, certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the
Internet, including the ability of Internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content. Other countries have attempted, are attempting or may
attempt to change or limit the legal protections available to businesses that depend on the Internet for the delivery of their services. These actions could potentially
limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or Internet service providers, increase our risk or add liabilities, impede our growth, productivity and
operational effectiveness, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.
Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations.
We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. We intend to seek to continue to
expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States or those that can affect international
operations generally, include:
•regional economic and political conditions, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergencies, including the
COVID-19 pandemic;
•localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;
•regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors;
•pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;
•foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our
operating results;
•compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption,
import/export, customs, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection and industry-specific laws and regulations,
including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur;
•liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, which could result in decreased values
of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations;
•vetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation;
•treatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments, and changes to tax codes, including being subject to
foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions;
•impacts of or uncertainties regarding the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”) on regulations, currencies, taxes and operations, including possible
disruptions to the sale of our services or the movement of our people between the United Kingdom, EU and other locations;
•uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the United States’ and other governments’ trade regulations, trade wars, tariffs, other restrictions or
other geopolitical events, including the evolving relations between the United States and China, the United States and Russia and conflict in Europe;
•changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate;
•regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers’ data
across international borders, which grow more complex as we scale, expand into new markets and enhance the breadth of our service offerings;
•different pricing environments;
18
Table of Contents
•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;
•different or lesser protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, and
more prevalent cybersecurity risks, particularly in jurisdictions in which we have historically chosen not to operate; and
•longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties.
Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully
expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations,
including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise
succeed.
As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may
encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all
of which could harm our business and operating results.
As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, and specific industries, such as financial services and
healthcare and life sciences, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In these
market segments, the customer’s decision to use our services is often an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, may require us to provide greater levels of education
regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers
with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally.
In addition, larger customers and governmental entities often demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these
sales opportunities often require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to
complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay
revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.
Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by
other new or existing customers. Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business.
For large enterprise customers, professional services are often performed by us, a third party, or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is
to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with
the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the
profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that
customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to
compete for new business with current or prospective customers.
We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need
to support our operations and growth.
Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief
executive officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring, departure or realignment of executives. For example,
in January 2023, Bret Taylor, our former co-CEO and Vice Chair of our board of directors, resigned from these positions with our company. Such changes may be
disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the
complexity of our services and technologies. Our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with
us at any time. Effective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success. If we do not develop adequate succession planning for our key
personnel, the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business.
The technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and
managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. We have experienced, and
currently experience, challenges with significant competition in talent recruitment and retention, and may not in the future be successful in recruiting or retaining
talent or achieving the workforce diversity goals we have set publicly. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in
hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on
immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled
19
Table of Contents
technology workers. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be
severely harmed.
In January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue
advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The Restructuring Plan includes a reduction of our workforce and select real estate exits and office space
reductions within certain markets. The actions associated with the employee restructuring under the Restructuring Plan are expected to be substantially complete by
the end of fiscal 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements. This Restructuring Plan, or any similar actions taken in the future, could negatively impact
our ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate key employees.
In addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition, equality and a sense of family. As our
organization has grown and expanded globally, and as our workplace plans have developed, including, for example, the Restructuring Plan, we have in the past and
may in the future find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture globally, including managing the complexities of
communicating with all employees. Our inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, harm our
reputation with customers, or negatively impact our future growth.
Any failure in our delivery of high-quality professional and technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our
financial results.
Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to
accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings. Outsourced provision of technical support may
be suddenly and adversely impacted by unforeseen events, for example, as occurred when certain business process outsourced service providers were delayed in
effectively servicing our customers due to conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding
revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business
reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do
not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our
business, operating results and financial position.
Strategic and Industry Risks
The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.
The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to changing technology, low
barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel
and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away
from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on
our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.
Our current competitors include:
•internally developed enterprise applications by our potential customers’ IT departments;
•vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software
application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;
•software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for
advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization;
•vendors who offer software tailored to specific services as opposed to our full suite of service offerings, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence
and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors or e-commerce solutions vendors;
•productivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market;
•traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that
allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services.
In addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings. Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive
advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more significant
20
Table of Contents
installed bases, broader geographic scope, broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical,
personnel and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer
bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors
that may be more agile in responding to customers’ demands and offer more targeted and simplified solutions. These competitors may be able to respond more
quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or provide competitive pricing, more
flexible contracts or faster implementations. As a result, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential
customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully
against our current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business.
Our efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may
not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue
for the foreseeable future. Our efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. In addition, the markets for
certain of our offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further,
the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades may not result in long term revenue growth.
In July 2021, we completed our acquisition of Slack, our largest acquisition to date. Slack is a relatively new category of business technology in a rapidly
evolving market for software, programs and tools used by knowledge workers. We may not succeed in enhancing and improving the features, integrations and
capabilities of Slack, or effectively introduce compelling new features, integrations and capabilities that reflect or anticipate the changing nature of the market which
may result in an inability to attract new users and organizations and increase revenue from existing paid customers.
If we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our
business could be harmed. For example, we may be required to continuously enhance our AI offerings to improve the quality of recommendations provided to our
customers. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance
of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to integrate all of our product and service offerings and
develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating
results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. In addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and
on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and
enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database
technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and
enhancements or in bringing them to market timely.
Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote
appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. Uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network
platforms or technologies, modifications to existing platforms or technologies, including text messaging capabilities, or changes in customer usage patterns thereof
could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors. Any failure of our services to operate
effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.
Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.
We believe that the brand identities we have developed, including associations with trust, customer success, innovation, performance and equality and
sustainability have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands is critical to
expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength, particularly for our core services, depends largely on our ability to remain a
technology leader and to continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services and features in a secure, reliable manner that enhances our customers’
success even as we scale and expand our services. In order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands, we have made and may in the future make substantial
investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services, or we may enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately
prove to be unsuccessful.
In addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or
publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand.
21
Table of Contents
Further, entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact our ability to protect our
brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial
condition may be materially and adversely affected.
We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital. Significant changes in the fair value
of this portfolio, including changes in the valuation of our investments in publicly traded and privately held companies, could negatively impact our financial
results.
We manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies,
technology startups and system integrators. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company’s
initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our
solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives. We continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain
cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. In
addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable
market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. All of our investments are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested
capital.
We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and both temporary
and permanent impairments to our investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our strategic investment
portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, we have had periods where our investment portfolio has recorded net losses and may have losses again in
future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio. Volatility in global
market conditions, including recent economic disruptions, inflation and ongoing volatility in the public equity markets, may impact our strategic investment portfolio
and our financial results may fluctuate from historical results and expectations.
If third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our
customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed.
Our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide
integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations,
data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. In addition, for those
customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security or integrity of the
data access, transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party
applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of
which could harm our reputation and our business.
Social and ethical issues, including the use or capabilities of AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability.
Policies we adopt or choose not to adopt on social and ethical issues, especially regarding the use of our products, may be unpopular with some of our
employees or with our customers or potential customers, which has in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain employees and
customers. We also may choose not to conduct business with potential customers or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to these policies.
Further, actions taken by our customers and employees, including through the use or misuse of our products or new technologies for illegal activities or improper
information sharing, may result in reputational harm or possible liability. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be
liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe that such claims lack merit, legal proceedings can be lengthy, expensive and
disruptive to our operations and the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of outcome, these types of claims
could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability.
We are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings. As with many innovations, AI and our Customer 360 platform present additional risks and
challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. For example, the development of AI and Customer 360, the latter of which provides
information regarding our customers’ customers, presents emerging ethical issues. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or
actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.
Data practices by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions. This in turn could undermine the decisions, predictions or
analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal
22
Table of Contents
liability and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to
help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as
generative AI content creation may require additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models and systems to test for
accuracy, bias and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly and could impact our profit margin if we decide to expand generative AI into our product
offerings. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such
systems.
Our aspirations and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our
reputation and performance.
We have established and publicly announced ESG goals, including our commitments to advancing racial and gender equality within our workforce and
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our
failure to accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, financial performance and
growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community as well as enforcement authorities.
Our ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include:
•the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources;
•the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures;
•the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other ESG standards;
•our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets; and
•the success of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations.
Standards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or
application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. This may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful
comparative data from period to period or between Salesforce and other companies in the same industry. In addition, our processes and controls may not comply with
evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required of public companies by the SEC,
and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to
achieve such goals in the future.
If our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain
employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or service provider could be negatively impacted. Further, our failure or perceived
failure to pursue or fulfill our goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards on a timely basis, or at all, could have similar negative impacts or expose
us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Privacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign
regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.
Regulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify
existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the collection, processing, storage, hosting, transfer and
use of data, generally. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”),
impose obligations directly on Salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. In addition, new domestic data privacy
laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection
Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, which goes into effect on July 1, 2023, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, which goes into effect July 1, 2023, and the Utah Consumer
Privacy Act, which goes into effect on December 31, 2023, similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both businesses and
service providers. These laws continue to evolve, and as various states introduce similar proposals, we and our customers could be exposed to additional regulatory
burdens. Further, laws and legislative proposals such as the EU’s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for
marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals’ online activities. The EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the
Digital Services Act, that may impose additional rules and restrictions on the use of the data in our products and services.
In addition, various safe harbors have historically been provided to those who hosted content provided by others, such as safe harbors from monetary damages
for copyright infringement arising from copyrighted content provided by customers and others and for defamation and other torts arising from information provided
by customers and others. There is an increasing
23
Table of Contents
demand for repealing or limiting these safe harbors by either judicial decision or legislation, and we have active legal proceedings that have been impacted by the
repeal or limiting of safe harbors that were previously available to us. Loss of these safe harbors may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require
additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers’ misconduct.
Although we monitor the regulatory, judicial and legislative environment and have invested in addressing these developments, these laws may require us to
make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability
exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance, including as a result of penalties, fines and lawsuits related to data breaches. Furthermore,
privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements are causing increased
scrutiny among customers, particularly in the public sector and highly regulated industries, and may be perceived differently from customer to customer. These
developments could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process
data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers' ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective
customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the
EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, one of the mechanisms that allowed companies, including Salesforce, to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area
(“EEA”) to the United States. Even if the CJEU decision upheld the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as an adequate transfer mechanism, the data exporters
are now also required when relying on SCCs to conduct a transfer risk assessment to verify if anything in the law and/or practices of the destination country may
impinge on the effectiveness of the SCCs in the context of the transfer at stake and, if so, to identify and adopt supplementary measures that are necessary to bring
the level of protection of the data transferred to the EU standard of essential equivalence. Where no supplementary measure is suitable, the data exporter should
avoid, suspend or terminate the transfer. Depending on how the CJEU’s decision is enforced, the cost and complexity of providing our services in certain markets
may increase. While the EU and U.S. governments have recently advanced the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to foster EU-to-U.S. data transfers and address the
concerns raised in the aforementioned CJEU decision, it is uncertain whether this framework will be overturned in court like the previous two EU-U.S. bilateral
cross-border transfer frameworks. As a result, regulators may be inclined to continue to interpret the CJEU’s decision, and the logic behind it, as significantly
restricting certain cross-border transfers. Certain countries outside of the EEA (e.g., China and India) have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring
varying degrees of local data residency. By way of further example, statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under the
CPRA and potentially other states’ laws, may increase our and our customers’ potential liability and the demands our customers place on us.
The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce
overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from our commitments to customers and our customers’ customers, lead to significant
fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, in particular where customers request
specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws, any of which could harm our business. In September 2021, Salesforce announced
the Hyperforce EU Operating Zone, which is expected to enable storage and processing of customer data solely within the EU. This EU service may enhance our
ability to attract and retain customers operating in the EU, but may also increase the cost and complexity of supporting those customers, and our customers may
request similar offerings in other territories.
In addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place
additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third
parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to
certain customers and could harm our business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through
private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. For example, in 2020 we were made a party to a
legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch citizens that claims we violated the GDPR and
Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our Audience Studio and Data Studio products. In December 2021, the
Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective inadmissible in its claims against us and dismissed the case, however this is currently being appealed by
the Privacy Collective. We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK, which has subsequently been dismissed. Although we believe that
these claims lack merit, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. In addition, the economic slowdown could
increase the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and or increase the cost of our compliance with the imposed
regulations.
Furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may
cause our customers or our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. In addition, new
products we develop or acquire in connection with
24
Table of Contents
changing events may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily
protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.
Industry-specific regulations and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions
or standards could harm our business.
Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and
telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud
computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions
may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to
devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have
imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to
outsourcing certain functions. In the United States, a cybersecurity Executive Order released in May 2021 may heighten future compliance and incident reporting
standards in order to obtain certain public sector contracts. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain
regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party
certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standards, may have
an adverse impact on our business and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards
relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results.
Further, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the
ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain
services we provide. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to
comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing
legislation that requires data to remain localized “in country,” as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their
choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. This is also true with
respect to the global proliferation of laws regulating the financial services industry, including its use of cloud services. In Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience
Act (DORA), which aims to ensure the resilience of the EU financial sectors, including through mandatory risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing
and third-party outsourcing restrictions, was formally adopted by the Council of the EU in November 2022. The UK is advancing similar legislation and other
countries may follow. Further, countries are considering legal frameworks on AI, which is a trend that may increase now that the European Commission has proposed
the first such framework. Any failure or perceived failure by Salesforce to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.
There are various statutes, regulations and rulings relevant to direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act (“TCPA”) and related Federal Communication Commission orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and
text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. We have
been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or
customers violated the TCPA. A determination that we or our customers violated the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant
damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In addition, many jurisdictions across the world are currently considering,
or have already begun implementing, changes to antitrust and competition laws, regulations or interpretative positions to enhance competition in digital markets and
address practices by certain digital platforms that they perceive to be anticompetitive. These regulatory efforts could result in laws, regulations or interpretative
positions that may require us to change certain of our business practices, undertake new compliance obligations or otherwise may have an adverse impact on our
business and results.
We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims, including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.
We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These include claims, suits, government investigations and other
proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as commercial, corporate and securities, labor and
employment, class actions, wage and hour, antitrust, data privacy and other matters.
The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of many patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights and by frequent litigation
based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications
from third parties, including practicing entities and
25
Table of Contents
non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We have also been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for
alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we
may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property
infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
In addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our customers, including through
the use or misuse of our products. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our
products by third parties. Although we believe that such claims lack merit, such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability.
Our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including claims related to the use of intellectual property as well as securities and related stockholder
derivative claims, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we are subject to ongoing securities class action litigation and related
stockholder derivative claims brought against Tableau and Slack that remain outstanding, and as to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement
costs. Additionally, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against
infringement risks with respect to acquired companies or technologies. In addition, third parties have made claims in connection with our acquisitions and may do so
in the future, and they may also make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our
acquisition.
The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims or lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and
lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from
executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of
intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or
licensing agreements.
Any adverse determination or settlement related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be
material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results, including our operating cash flow in a particular
period. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future
results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
Any failure to obtain registration or protection of our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our
brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harm our business.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur
significant expenses and harming our business. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated
through administrative process or litigation. While we have many U.S. patents and pending U.S. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain
patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In
addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third
parties. Similar uncertainty applies to our U.S. and international trademark registrations and applications. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity,
enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some
intellectual property rights in the U.S. and elsewhere. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in
which our services are available and legal changes and uncertainty in various countries’ intellectual property regimes may result in making conduct that we believe is
lawful to be deemed violative of others’ rights. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and
mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard-setting activity, our contribution to open source
projects, various competition law regimes or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property in certain circumstances.
Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property.
We may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation
against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights,
it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. Furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant
expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources from our core business, and harm our business.
We may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations.
Our contracts with federal, state, local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their
formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations
26
Table of Contents
relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of
contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition,
such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could
adversely impact our future sales and operating results.
We are subject to governmental sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and may subject
us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.
Our solutions are subject to export and import controls where we conduct our business activities, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export
Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, U.S. supply chain regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the U.S.
Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with applicable trade laws, we and certain of our employees could be subject to
substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of trade privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers;
and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining necessary authorizations, including any required licenses, may be time-
consuming, requires expenditure of corporate resources, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or the ability to realize value
from certain acquisitions or engagements. Acquisitions may also subject us to successor liability and other integration compliance risks. Furthermore, U.S. export
control laws and economic sanctions may prohibit or limit the transfer of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and
parties. We can provide no assurance that any of the precautions we take to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to U.S. sanctions targets in
violation of applicable regulations will be effective, and, accordingly, our solutions could be provisioned or provided to those targets, including by our resellers or
other third parties, which could have negative consequences for our business, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our
solutions or trade regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of
our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions
may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Import and export control regulations in the United States and other countries are
subject to change and uncertainty, including as a result of geopolitical developments and relations between the United States and China, the United States and Russia
and war in Europe.
Financial Risks
Because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may
not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a
result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a
decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue in
future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully
reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales
in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term.
If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could
be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.
Due to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, including from the global economic impact of geopolitical conflict in
Europe, the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity
of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from software license sales, and our increasing
focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. We plan our expense and investment levels based on
estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the
renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations, and unanticipated events may cause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated. A portion of
our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center and infrastructure
service contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early.
As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may
decline in the future. In some periods, we have not been able to, and may not be able in the future to provide continued operating margin expansion, which could
harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and global tax developments may impact our financial results.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is often required in the determination of our
worldwide provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
changes in operations, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in the tax effects of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax
assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions and changes in accounting principles and tax
laws. Any changes, ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our
income tax liabilities.
We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state, local or
international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or
judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, or changes to our business operations, including as a result of acquisitions. Any resulting increase in our tax
obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.
We are also subject to tax examinations or engaged in alternative resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may
change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination
of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial position.
As our business continues to grow, increasing our brand recognition and profitability, we may be subject to increased scrutiny and corresponding tax disputes,
which may impact our cash flows and financial results. Furthermore, our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile, and if perceived
negatively, may cause brand or reputational harm.
As we utilize our remaining tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards, we may be unable to mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior
years, which could have a material impact to our future cash flows. In addition, changes to our operating structure, including changes related to acquisitions, may
result in cash tax obligations.
Global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business, cash flows from operating activities, or financial
results. Such developments, for example, may include certain new provisions introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, certain Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development’s proposals including the implementation of the global minimum tax under the Pillar Two model rules, and the European Commission’s
and certain major jurisdictions’ heightened interest in and taxation of companies participating in the digital economy. Furthermore, governments’ responses to
macroeconomic factors such as shrinking gross domestic product or increased inflation rates may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect
our cash flows and financial results.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash
flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies.
We primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to
risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our
international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the
local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen,
Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Israeli Shekel against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve,
economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both
increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, combined with the
seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.
Additionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including conflict in Europe, fluctuating commodity prices, trade tariff developments and
inflation have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the
future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our
hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency
exchange rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
Our debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.
As of January 31, 2023, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes and the loan we assumed when we purchased 50 Fremont.
We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $3.0 billion Credit Facility. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under
the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2023,
28
Table of Contents
we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, financing the
consideration for and fees, costs and expenses related to any acquisition.
In addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments
on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, such as commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are
not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.
Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:
•impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;
•cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments; and
•make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.
Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic,
regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations
may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we
could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we
may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain
additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any
additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest
rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business. In addition, we may seek debt financing to fund future acquisitions. We can offer
no assurance that we can obtain debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
In addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as
well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future
financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
The indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with
specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other
provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. Any
required repayment of our debt as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those
funds available for use in our business.
Lease accounting guidance requires that we record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet, which increases both our assets and
liabilities and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all. Our lease terms may
include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability and
associated asset only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. We reassess the lease term if
and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. The potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial
position and financial results.
Current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial and nonfinancial reporting standards may negatively impact our financial results.
We regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial and nonfinancial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and interpretations that
are relevant to us. As a result of new financial or nonfinancial standards or pronouncements, changes to existing standards or pronouncements and changes in their
interpretation, we may be required to change our accounting policies, to alter our operational policies, to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they
reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, and to adjust our published financial statements. For example, proposed reporting requirements such as the
SEC proposals related to the enhancement and standardization of climate-related disclosures may require us to change our accounting policies, to alter our
operational policies and to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or to restate our published
financial statements. Such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our
revenue and operating profit targets, which may negatively impact our financial results.

Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock
Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially.
Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. Fluctuations have occurred due to known and unknown risks, such as the sudden and unanticipated effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic and rising interest rates. In addition, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and the
year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate
in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter has typically
in the past been our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.
Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
•general economic or geopolitical conditions, including the impacts of the conflict in Europe, financial market conditions, increasing costs of operation and
foreign currency exchange rates, any of which can adversely affect either our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or
upgrade their services, or delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates;
•our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements;
•the attrition rates for our services;
•the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;
•the length of the sales cycle for our services;
•new product and service introductions by our competitors;
•our success in selling our services to large enterprises;
•changes in unearned revenue and remaining performance obligation, due to seasonality, the timing of and compounding effects of renewals, invoice
duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter, average contract term, the collectability of invoices related to multi-
year agreements, the timing of license software revenue recognition, or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied
growth rates;
•our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments;
•variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our subscription and support offerings, including the timing of software license sales and
sales offerings that include an on-premise software element for which the revenue allocated to that deliverable is recognized upfront;
•the seasonality of our sales cycle, including software license sales, and timing of contract execution and the corresponding impact on revenue recognized at
a point in time;
•changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition, customer preference or other factors;
•expenses associated with our pricing policies and terms of contracts, such as the costs of customer SMS text usage paid by us and the related impacts to our
gross margin;
•the seasonality of our customers’ businesses, especially our Commerce service offering customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers;
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling;
•the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;
•the number of new employees, including the cost to recruit and train such employees;
•the timing of commission, bonus and other compensation payments to employees, including decisions to guarantee some portion of commissions payments
in connection with extraordinary events;
•the cost, timing and management effort required for the introduction of new features to our services;
•the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired
businesses;
•expenses related to our real estate or changes in the nature or extent of our use of existing real estate, including our office leases and our data center capacity
and expansion;
30
Table of Contents
•timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services;
•expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur;
•extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;
•income tax effects resulting from, but not limited to, tax law changes, court decisions on tax matters, global tax developments applicable to multinational
corporations, changes in operations or business structures and acquisition activity;
•the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock
options;
•technical difficulties or interruptions in our services;
•changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities;
•conditions, and particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value and liquidity of our
investment portfolio;
•changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in early-to-late-stage privately held and public companies, including temporary impairments, which
could negatively and materially impact our financial results, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations;
•equity or debt issuances, including as consideration in or in conjunction with acquisitions;
•the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis
over their vesting schedules;
•evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations;
•regulatory compliance and acquisition costs; and
•the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations.
Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. If we fail to meet
or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we
do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their
recommendations regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline.
The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.
The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has
been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:
•variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, year-over-
year growth rates for individual service offerings and other financial and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;
•variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business;
•forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue, current remaining performance obligation, cash flows
from operating activities and earnings per share, the accuracy of which may be impacted by various factors, many of which are beyond our control,
including general economic and market conditions and unanticipated delays in the integration of acquired companies as a result of regulatory review;
•our ability to meet or exceed forward-looking guidance we have given or to meet or exceed the expectations of investors, analysts or others; our ability to
give forward-looking guidance consistent with past practices; and changes to or withdrawal of previous guidance or long-range targets;
•changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;
•announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our
competitors;
•announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;
•announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;
31
Table of Contents
•the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs;
•recruitment or departure of key personnel, such as the recent departure of our former co-CEO;
•disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;
•the economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, including global trade and health concerns, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our
customers;
•trading activity or positions by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, as
well as other institutional or activist investors;
•the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition or a capital-raising transaction;
•the inability to execute on our Share Repurchase Program as planned, including failure to meet internal or external expectations around the timing or price
of share repurchases, and any reductions or discontinuances of repurchases thereunder;
•issuance of debt or other convertible securities;
•the inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
•changes to our credit ratings; and
•ESG and other issues impacting our reputation.
In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the greater securities market in general experience uneven investor confidence, the market price of our
common stock has and could in the future decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common
stock has and might in the future also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly
affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation, such as the
securities litigation against Slack that was brought before our acquisition. Such litigation, whether against Salesforce or an acquired subsidiary, could result in
substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources and liability resulting from or the settlement of such litigation could result in material
adverse impacts to our operating cash flows or results of operations for a given period.
Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control
of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to
discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in our management that the stockholders of the Company may deem advantageous.
These provisions among other things:
•permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;
•authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a “poison pill”);
•prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;
•provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and
•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual
stockholder meetings.
In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes
certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock.
General Risks
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our
businesses, and have in the past materially affected our operating results and cash flows; the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of
operations and cash flows remain uncertain.
The COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and have in the
past materially affected our operating results and cash flows; the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results remain uncertain. We have in the past
and may in the future deem it advisable to alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee and industry events.

Changes in our work environment and workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have and could in the future adversely affect our operations. In
particular, although most of our offices have reopened, we have offered a significant percentage of our employees the flexibility in the amount of time they work in
an office. This presents risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy and presents operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our
business. Even as the pandemic moves into endemic stages, our employees may be exposed to health risks and government directives may require us to again close
certain of our offices that have since been reopened.
Our operations were negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control, and COVID-19
remains a public health emergency in certain parts of the world, which could impact the operations of our business infrastructure and service providers in such parts
of the world and delay our security measures, business processes, product development and foreign investments. As we continue to monitor the situation and public
health guidance throughout the world, we may adjust our current policies and practices, and existing and new precautionary measures could negatively affect our
operations.
The duration and extent of the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic conditions on our financial condition or results of operations
remains uncertain. Due to our subscription-based business model, these effects may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If there is a
substantial impact on our customers’ business or the productivity of our employees or partners, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be
harmed. The global macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts on our customers’ business operations and their demand for our products
and services may persist for an indefinite period, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten
other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.
Volatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our industry, business and results of
operations.
Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have
experienced significant economic and market downturns in the past, and are likely to experience additional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic
activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity
and foreign exchange markets, inflation, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly, as did the
conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political
developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as conflict in Europe, have increased levels of political and
economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Moreover, these conditions have affected and may continue to affect the
rate of IT spending; could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services; have
delayed and may delay customer purchasing decisions; have reduced and may in the future reduce the value and duration of customer subscription contracts; and we
expect these conditions will adversely affect our customer attrition rates. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and
operating results.
Natural disasters and other events beyond our control have in the past and may in the future materially adversely affect us.
Natural disasters or other catastrophic events have in the past and may in the future cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and
the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations, the business operations of third-party providers or suppliers that we
rely on to conduct our business and the business operations of our customers are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shutoffs or shortages, actual
or threatened public health emergencies and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events
could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. Our corporate headquarters, and a
significant portion of our personnel, research and development activities, IT systems and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in
the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in
San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely
affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event, and the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the
same time as another unexpected and adverse event. For example, wildfires have resulted in power shut-offs in the San Francisco Bay Area and are likely to occur in
the future, and this could adversely affect the work-from-home operations of our employees in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Climate change may have an impact on our business.
While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations
who are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, we recognize
33
Table of Contents
that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.
For example, our offices globally have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency,
including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, flooding, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire
prevention. Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees to the extent they work from home. Changing market dynamics,
global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere have the
potential to disrupt our business, the business of third-party providers or suppliers that we rely on to conduct our business and the business of our customers, and may
cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, failure to uphold, meet or make timely forward
progress against our public commitments and goals related to climate action could adversely affect our reputation with investors, suppliers and customers, our
financial performance or our ability to recruit and retain talent.
ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES
As of January 31, 2023, our executive and principal offices for sales, marketing, professional services, development and administration consisted of
approximately 1.6 million square feet of leased and owned property in San Francisco. Excluded from this amount is approximately 0.8 million square feet in San
Francisco that is currently sublet, as well as approximately 0.7 million square feet in San Francisco currently available to sublease as we continued consolidating and
subleasing additional real estate leases in fiscal 2023.
We also lease office space for our operations in various locations throughout the United States as well as office space in a number of countries in Europe, North
America, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia.
We operate data centers in the U.S., Europe and Asia pursuant to various co-location lease arrangements.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we made a decision to exit or reduce office space in select locations within certain markets under operating
leases. See Note 10 Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding our select real estate exits and office space reductions within certain markets.
We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able
to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms.
ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the
expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription
agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling
on such a claim.
The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and
lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in
efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our
technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.
For more information regarding legal proceedings see Note 14 “Legal Proceedings and Claims” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II.

Overview
Salesforce, Inc. is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology that brings companies and customers together in the digital age.
Founded in 1999, we enable companies of every size and industry to take advantage of
38
Table of Contents
powerful technologies to connect to their customers in a whole new way and help them transform their businesses around the customer in this digital-first world.
Our Customer 360 platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a
complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized
experiences across every channel and increase productivity. With Slack, we provide a digital headquarters where companies, employees, governments and
stakeholders can create success from anywhere.
We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and
international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market
approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs
upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and
support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our
company average.
In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in
January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins, and continue advancing our ongoing
commitment to profitable growth. The Plan includes a reduction of our workforce by approximately 10 percent and select real estate exits and office space reductions
within certain markets. We expect to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing
expense and general and administrative expenses. We plan to continue to grow and innovate our business and service offerings and expand our leadership role in the
cloud computing industry.
Highlights from the Fiscal Year 2023
•Revenue: For fiscal 2023, revenue was $31.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent year-over-year.
•Earnings per Share: For fiscal 2023, diluted earnings per share was $0.21 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.48 from a year ago.
•Cash: Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2023 was $7.1 billion, an increase of 19 percent year-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities as of January 31, 2023 was $12.5 billion.
•Remaining Performance Obligation: Total remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2023 was approximately $48.6 billion, an increase of 11
percent year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2023 was approximately $24.6 billion, an increase of 12 percent year-
over-year.
•Share Repurchase Program: In August 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock. During
the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 28 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.0 billion. As of January
31, 2023, we were authorized to purchase a remaining $6.0 billion of our common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2023, the Board
of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program, for an aggregate total authorized of $20.0 billion.
•Restructuring: In January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins, and
continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The Plan includes a reduction of our workforce and select real estate exits and office
space reductions within certain markets. For fiscal 2023, we incurred approximately $828 million related to the Plan.
While we continue to see growth in our total revenues, macroeconomic factors have impacted our business and our customers’ businesses in ways that are
difficult to isolate and quantify. Beginning in July 2022, we saw more measured buying behavior from our customers resulting in stretched sales cycles, additional
approval layers required from our customers and deal compression. These trends continued in the second half of fiscal 2023. Slower growth in new and renewal
business, particularly if sustained, impacts our remaining performance obligation, revenues and our ability to meet financial guidance and long-term targets.
In addition, the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency
markets. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted revenues by approximately four percent in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 and negatively
impacted our current remaining performance obligation by approximately one percent as of January 31, 2023 compared to what we would have reported as of
January 31, 2022 using constant currency rates. During fiscal 2023, the United States Dollar has strengthened significantly against certain foreign currencies in the
markets in which we operate, particularly against the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. Based on the continued volatility in foreign currency markets,
we expect lower revenue growth in the near-term compared to past results. If these conditions continue throughout fiscal 2024, they could have a material adverse
impact on our near-term results and our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations could also be compounded by
the
39
Table of Contents
seasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2023, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.
Operating Segments
We operate as one segment. See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion
about our segments.
Sources of Revenues
We derive our revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues
accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2023.
Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, "Cloud Services"),
software license revenues from the sales of term and perpetual licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees
or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue
is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term and perpetual software licenses
that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from software licenses are generally recognized at the point in
time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is
generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from
software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2023.
The revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in “Results of Operations,” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time.
Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions.
For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offerings to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these
service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and
future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage.
Our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We
calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. As of January 31, 2023, our attrition rate, excluding
MuleSoft, Tableau and Slack, was below 7.5 percent. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Mulesoft and Tableau will be included in our attrition rate
calculation, which we expect to slightly increase our attrition rate going forward.
We continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate
consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues.
Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow
Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our
subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay
us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether
transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in
advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may
occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying
patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in
both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to
increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating
cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating
40
Table of Contents
cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing
costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity.
Remaining Performance Obligation
Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue
and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next
12 months.
Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing
of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by
acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end
exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are
typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation
attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future
revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as
the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation.
Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data
center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits, and
allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the
cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred
supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, specific to
customer experience and technical operations.
Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based
compensation expense, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates
the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success. The cost of professional services
may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead.
Marketing and Sales 
Marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based
compensation expense and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing
programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We capitalize certain costs to obtain customer
contracts, such as commissions, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis. As such, the timing of expense recognition for these commissions is not consistent
with the timing of the associated cash payment.
Our marketing and sales expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired
company’s trade names, customer lists and customer relationships.
General and Administrative 
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for finance and
accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, professional services fees and allocated overhead.
We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are
allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, these types of expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense
category.

Restructuring
Restructuring, related to the January 2023 Plan, consist primarily of charges related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits and share-
based compensation as well as exit charges associated with office space reductions. The actions associated with the employee restructuring under the Plan are
expected to be substantially complete by the end of our fiscal 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements. The actions associated with the real estate
restructuring under the Plan are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. Restructuring excludes allocated overhead.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses
and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our
consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.
Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations. We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer
multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to
transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately
or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.
Cloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we
consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the
timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the
customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have generally concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple
performance obligations are distinct.
We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ("SSP") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would
sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP
by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size
and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and
contract prices. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we determine the estimated standalone selling price using information that
may include market conditions or other observable inputs. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could
result in changes to SSP.
In certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar
customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we
use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one
SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.
Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date
with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to
accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired
intangible assets.
Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are:
•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed
technologies and patents;
•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;
•assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;
•discount rates;
•uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed;
•fair value of assumed equity awards; and
42
Table of Contents
•fair value of pre-existing relationships.
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
Income Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be
realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable
income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax
law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the
reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future
market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred
tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position
only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is
measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest
accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.
Strategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or
significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. Privately held debt and
equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market
prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar
security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the
estimated fair value for these investments, we utilize the most recent data available and apply valuation methods, including the market approach and option pricing
models (“OPM”), adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the classes of securities we hold. Such information available to us from investee companies
is supplemented with estimates such as volatility and expected time to liquidity.
We assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses an
assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and
the rate at which the investee is using its cash. Depending on our contractual rights as an investor, investee specific information available to us to make this
assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by
recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.
The particular privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure,
may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment
value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent in the enterprise
values of our largest privately held equity securities, representing 37 percent of our total strategic investments as of January 31, 2023, could result in a $115 million
reduction in the value of our investment portfolio.

Impact of Acquisitions
The comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022 was impacted by our recent
acquisitions, including the acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (“Slack”) in July 2021, our largest acquisition to date, such that approximately six months of Slack
revenues and expenses are included in fiscal 2022 whereas 12 months of Slack operations are included in fiscal 2023. In our discussion of changes in our results of
operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products
and services for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date for the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful.
Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of
these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.

Professional services and other 2,331 1,835 496 27 
Total revenues $ 31,352 $ 26,492 $ 4,860 18 %
The increase in subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2023 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new
customers, upgrades, additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for
either period. Revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represent approximately six percent and seven percent of
total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total
revenues for fiscal 2023 and 2022.
For business combinations prior to fiscal 2023, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of
acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an
independent entity. In fiscal 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and
Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2021-08”) which requires contract liabilities (i.e., unearned revenue) acquired in a business combination
to be recognized and measured in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, thereby eliminating the previously unrecognized would-be
revenue. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not materially impact our results of operations in fiscal 2023.
The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.

Our Industry Offerings revenue is included in one of the above service offerings depending on the primary service purchased. Slack revenues are included in
Platform and Other. Data is comprised of revenue from Analytics and Integration service offerings.
Data subscription and support revenues include revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at the point in time when the
software is made available to the customer. Therefore, we expect Data to experience greater volatility in revenues period to period compared to our other service
offerings. Additionally, as we transition customers within the Data offering from perpetual and term software licenses to subscription based services, revenue
associated with such customers will generally be recognized ratably over the contract term, resulting in potentially less revenue in the period the customer transitions
but potentially increasing revenues over the remaining term.

Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. The
increase in revenues across all regions was due primarily to the continued execution of our business and growth strategy, including increasing our geographic reach
primarily through extending our go-to-market capabilities globally. During fiscal 2023, revenues outside of the Americas were negatively impacted by foreign
currency fluctuations by approximately ten percent compared to fiscal 2022.

Total cost of revenues $ 8,360 27 %$ 7,026 27 %$ 1,334 
For fiscal 2023, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $638 million in employee-related costs, including stock-based
compensation expense. We have increased our headcount associated with our data centers, customer support and professional services by 27 percent since fiscal 2022
to meet the higher demand for services from our customers as well as from our fiscal 2023 acquisition of Traction on Demand. Fiscal 2023 cost of revenues, as a
percentage of revenues, were consistent to that of fiscal 2022.
We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers
and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add employees in our

professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses is expected to affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute
dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the near term.

Total operating expenses $ 21,962 70 %$ 18,918 71 %$ 3,044 
For fiscal 2023, the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately $547 million in employee-related costs,
including stock-based compensation expense. Our research and development headcount increased by three percent since fiscal 2022 in order to improve and extend
our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies. Fiscal 2023 research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenues,
decreased compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to our hiring pause that began in the second half of fiscal 2023 as well as our January 2023 restructuring plan.
We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in the near term as we
continue to invest in technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.
For fiscal 2023, the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 billion in employee-related costs, including the
amortization of deferred commissions and stock-based compensation expense. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by three percent since fiscal 2022
primarily due to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Fiscal 2023
marketing and sales expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to our hiring pause that began in the second half of fiscal
2023, our January 2023 restructuring plan and decreased marketing expenses.
We expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may decrease as a percentage of revenues in the near term as we focus on
leveraging our self-serve and partner-led channels and increasing our sales productivity.
For fiscal 2023, the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased third-party and miscellaneous expenses. Our general and
administrative headcount increased by five percent since fiscal 2022 as we added personnel to support our growth. General and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of revenue, decreased primarily due to our hiring pause in the second half of fiscal 2023, our January 2023 restructuring plan and real estate exits that
occurred in fiscal 2023.
We expect that general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars and may decrease as a percentage of revenues in the near term as we
continue to invest in process efficiency initiatives.
In fiscal 2023, approximately $828 million of costs were incurred related to the January 2023 restructuring plan, of which approximately $683 million relates
to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense and $145 million relates to exit charges associated with office
space reductions. We expect to incur approximately $600 million to $1.1 billion in charges in connection with the Plan in the near term.

Gains (losses) on strategic investments, net $ (239)$ 1,211 $ (1,450)
Other expense (131) (227) 96 
Gains (losses) on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price
adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments including impairments. Our strategic investment portfolio continues to be affected by
high public equity market volatility as well as challenging market conditions for companies in which we hold private equity or debt investments. In fiscal 2023 these
factors resulted in impairments on privately held equity and debt securities of $491 million, partially offset by $180 million in unrealized gains on privately held
equity securities.
Other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our finance leases, offset by interest income on our marketable securities portfolio.
Other expense decreased primarily due to an increase in investment income from rising interest rates offset by an increase in interest expense primarily driven by our
issuance of $8.0 billion Senior Notes in July 2021.

Effective tax rate 68 % 6 %
In fiscal 2023, we recognized a tax provision of $452 million on a pretax income of $660 million. The majority of the tax provision was related to taxes from
profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States which includes withholding taxes. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate due to changes in our domestic and foreign
earnings, or material discrete tax items, or a combination of these factors resulting from transactions or events, for example, acquisitions, changes to our operating
structure and other macroeconomic factors.
In fiscal 2022, we recognized a tax provision of $88 million on a pretax income of $1.5 billion. Our tax provision was primarily due to taxes from profitable
jurisdictions outside of the United States, which was offset by a net US tax benefit primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation.
The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced new provisions,
including a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax for certain large corporations that have at least an average of
$1 billion adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-tax-year period. The corporate minimum tax will be
effective for fiscal 2024. While we do not anticipate this change to be significant, it could impact our consolidated financial position. We continue to monitor and
analyze new information, interpretations and guidance.
Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 and 2021
For a discussion of the year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the year ended January 31, 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At January 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.5 billion and accounts receivable of
$10.8 billion. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency
obligations, asset-backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage-backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and
municipal securities. Our credit agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”), which as of January 31, 2023 provides the ability to borrow up to $3.0 billion
in unsecured financing (the “Credit Facility”), also serves as a source of liquidity.
Cash from operations could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled
“Risk Factors.” We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted
non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be
sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt maintenance needs over the next 12 months.

In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. To
facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting
our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.
Cash Flows
For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 our cash flows were as follows (in millions):
4 Fiscal Year Ended January 31,
 2023 2022 2021
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,111 $ 6,000 $ 4,801 
Net cash used in investing activities (1,989) (14,536) (3,971)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (3,562) 7,838 1,194 
Operating Activities
The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 was related to net income of $208 million, adjusted for non-cash items including $3.8 billion
of depreciation and amortization and $3.3 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. Cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted
by factors such as growth in new business, timing of cash receipts from customers, vendor payment terms and timing of payments to vendors. Cash provided by
operating activities during fiscal 2023 was further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $1.7 billion, partially offset by the change in costs capitalized to
obtain revenue contracts, net of $2.3 billion and accounts receivable, net of $1.0 billion due to cash collections. Cash provided by operating activities was impacted
by the provision from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which became effective in fiscal 2023 and requires the capitalization and amortization of research and
development costs. The change increased our cash taxes paid in fiscal 2023. As our business continues to grow and our expenses remain in line with or less than our
revenue growth, we expect to continue to see growth in net cash provided by operating activities.
The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily related to net income of $1.4 billion, adjusted for non-cash items including $3.3
billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 billion related to stock-based expense offset by $1.2 billion related to gains on strategic investments. Cash provided
by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $2.6 billion, partially offset by accounts receivable, net of $1.8
billion.
Investing Activities
The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2023 was primarily related to capital expenditures of $798 million, net outflows of $557 million from
marketable securities activity, cash consideration for acquisitions of approximately $439 million and net outflows of $195 million from strategic investment activity.
The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily related to cash consideration for the acquisitions of Slack and Acumen, as well as
other acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of approximately $14.9 billion. Net cash used in investing activities was impacted by net inflows of $574 million from
marketable securities activity and $483 million from strategic investment activity.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2023 consisted primarily of $4.0 billion from repurchases of common stock partially offset by $861 million
from proceeds from equity plans.
Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of $7.9 billion of net proceeds from our July 2021 issuance of Senior Notes
and $1.3 billion from proceeds from equity plans, partially offset by payments related to the Slack Convertible Notes, net of associated capped call proceeds of $1.2
billion.
Debt
As of January 31, 2023, we had senior unsecured debt outstanding, with maturities starting in April 2023 through July 2061. The total carrying value of this
debt was $10.6 billion, of which $1.0 billion is related to the 2023 Senior Notes due in the next 12 months. In addition, we had senior secured notes outstanding
related to our loan on our purchase of an office building located at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco (“50 Fremont”), due in June 2023, with a total carrying value
of $182 million. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2023.
In December 2020, we entered into the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving Credit Facility that matures
in December 2025. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2023. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the
Credit Facility for general corporate purposes,
49
Table of Contents
which may include, without limitation, financing the consideration for, fees, costs and expenses related to any acquisition. In April 2022, we amended the Revolving
Loan Credit Agreement to reflect certain immaterial administrative changes.
We do not have any special purpose entities and we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
Share Repurchase Program
In August 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). The
Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. During the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 28 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.0 billion at an average cost of $144.94. All
repurchases were made in open market transactions. As of January 31, 2023, we were authorized to purchase a remaining $6.0 billion of the Company’s common
stock under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share
Repurchase Program, for an aggregate total authorized of $20.0 billion. Subsequent to January 31, 2023, we have paid approximately $0.3 billion through March 6,
2023 for additional shares under the Share Repurchase Program.
The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. It introduced a new 1 percent excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases made after
December 31, 2022. It did not impact our financing cash flows in fiscal 2023. The excise tax may apply to future repurchases and could impact our financing cash
flows.
Contractual Obligations
Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as
well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. As of January 31, 2023, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these
commitments were approximately $4.7 billion, with payments of $933 million due in the next 12 months and $3.8 billion due thereafter. As of January 31, 2023, we
have additional operating leases that have not yet commenced totaling $0.4 billion. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash
provided by operating activities.
In addition to our leasing arrangements, we have other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, including
those with infrastructure service providers. Our total commitments under these agreements are $6.5 billion, of which payments of $1.1 billion are due in the next 12
months and $5.4 billion are due thereafter. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities.
During fiscal 2023 and in future fiscal years, we have made, and expect to continue to make, additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our
operations to increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth.
While we continue to make investments in our infrastructure including offices, information technology and data centers, as well as investments with infrastructure
service providers, to provide capacity for the growth of our business, our strategy may continue to change related to these investments and we may slow the pace of
our investments.
Other Future Obligations
Our overall acquisition strategy may evolve to require integration and business operation changes that may result in incremental income tax costs. The timing
and amount of a tax cash payment, if any, is uncertain and would be based upon a number of factors, including our integration plans, valuations related to
intercompany transactions, the tax rate in effect at the time, potential negotiations with the taxing authorities and potential litigation. Additionally, as we utilize our
remaining tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards, we expect an increase in future cash taxes.
The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced new provisions, including a 15 percent corporate
alternative minimum tax for certain large corporations that have at least an average of $1 billion adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-tax-
year period. The corporate minimum tax will be effective in fiscal 2024. While we do not anticipate this change to be significant, it could impact our consolidated
financial position. We continue to monitor and analyze new information, interpretation and guidance.
Additionally, related to the restructuring plan announced in January 2023, we expect approximately $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion in future cash expenditures,
primarily related to workforce costs such as severance payments.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment risks. This exposure has
increased due to recent financial market movements and changes to our expectations of near-term possible movements caused by the impact of the macroeconomic
environment and COVID-19 as discussed in more detail below.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global
scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple
currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party infrastructure providers, additional headcount
in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject
to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Brazilian Real against the United
States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change, including market impacts associated
with COVID-19. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk
Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable,
intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as
speculative.
We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally
short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging
instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of
our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of
the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on
the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net
realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors.
Foreign Currency Translation Risk
Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign
subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Total revenue during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, was negatively impacted by approximately
four percent compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. In addition, fluctuations in USD against international currencies negatively impacted our current
remaining performance obligation by approximately one percent as of January 31, 2023 compared to what we would have reported as of January 31, 2022 using
constant currency rates.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.5 billion as of January 31, 2023. This amount was invested primarily in money market
funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or
technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or
speculative purposes.
Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate securities may have their
market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part
to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to
sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses
are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or due to expected credit losses.
Our fixed-income portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2023 could
result in a $56 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes
when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations
52
Table of Contents
in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive loss, net, and
are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.
At January 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $10.5 billion. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have
resulted in market value changes of $58 million.
Market Risk and Market Interest Risk
We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions.
Debt
We maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions):
Instrument Maturity DatePrincipal
Outstanding as of
January 31, 2023 Interest Terms Contractual Interest Rate
2023 Senior Notes April 2023 $ 1,000 Fixed 3.25%
Loan assumed on 50 Fremont June 2023 182 Fixed 3.75
2024 Senior Notes July 2024 1,000 Fixed 0.625
Credit Facility December 2025 0 Floating N/A
2028 Senior Notes April 2028 1,500 Fixed 3.70
2028 Senior Sustainability Notes July 2028 1,000 Fixed 1.50
2031 Senior Notes July 2031 1,500 Fixed 1.95
2041 Senior Notes July 2041 1,250 Fixed 2.70
2051 Senior Notes July 2051 2,000 Fixed 2.90
2061 Senior Notes July 2061 1,250 Fixed 3.05
The borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.125% or an adjusted benchmark rate plus a
spread of 0.50% to 1.125%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. We are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on
undrawn amounts. As of January 31, 2023, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Facility.
The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we
only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and
potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We
generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do
not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.
Strategic Investments
As of January 31, 2023, our strategic investment portfolio consisted of investments in over 400 companies with a combined carrying value of $4.7 billion,
including two privately held investments with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of the total strategic investments portfolio and
represented sixteen percent of the portfolio in aggregate.
The following table sets forth additional information regarding active equity investments within our strategic investment portfolio as of January 31, 2023 and
excludes exited investments (in millions):
Investment Type Capital Invested Unrealized Gains (Cumulative) Unrealized Losses (Cumulative)Carrying Value as of January 31,
2023
Publicly held equity securities $ 2 $ 2 $ (1)$ 3 
Privately held equity securities 3,611 1,310 (321) 4,600 
Total equity securities $ 3,613 $ 1,312 $ (322)$ 4,603 
We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments to
our investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our strategic investment portfolio has had a positive
impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within
our strategic investments portfolio. Volatility in the global market conditions, including recent economic disruptions, inflation and ongoing volatility in the public
equity markets, may impact our strategic investment portfolio and our financial results may fluctuate from historical results and expectations.
Our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and
53
Table of Contents
preferences. The particular securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the
magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific
company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent in the enterprise values of our largest
privately held equity securities, representing 37 percent of our total strategic investments as of January 31, 2023, could result in a $115 million reduction in the value
of our investment portfolio. Fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or
similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment.
We continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted
by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering.
In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other
favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. All of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are
therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Salesforce, Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 8, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks
of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Revenue Recognition
Description of the
MatterAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue primarily from subscription and
support services and professional services contracts in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in
exchange for those products or services. The Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer
multiple cloud services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. Significant judgment may be required by the
Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, including the determination of whether products and
services are considered distinct performance obligations and the determination of standalone selling prices, particularly for products
and services that are not sold separately.
Auditing the Company’s accounting for revenue contracts with customers required significant judgment to assess management’s
determination of performance obligations and standalone selling prices.
How We Addressed the
Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process to
identify performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to those performance obligations, including controls over
determining standalone selling prices.
To test the Company’s judgments and conclusions related to the identification of performance obligations and determination of
standalone selling prices, our audit procedures included, among others, obtaining an understanding of the Company’s various service
offerings and evaluating management’s conclusions regarding which were distinct. We read a sample of executed contracts to assess
management’s evaluation of significant terms, including the determination of distinct performance obligations, and the related
standalone selling price. We evaluated the information utilized to determine standalone selling price and we tested the mathematical
accuracy of the Company’s calculations.
Impairment of Strategic Investments
Description of the
MatterAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company holds investments in privately held equity securities,
which are assessed for impairment at least quarterly. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both
qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or
technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. Significant judgment may be required by the Company in determining if
an investment is impaired based on the information available about the investee.
Auditing the Company’s accounting for impairment of privately held equity securities required significant judgment to evaluate
management’s assessment of impairment indicators to evaluate whether investments are impaired considering the current economic
environment.
How We Addressed the
Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process to
identify impaired privately held equity securities, including controls over assessing impairment indicators.
To test the Company’s judgments and conclusions related to impairment of privately held equity securities, our audit procedures
included, among others, obtaining an understanding of the nature of the privately held equity securities and evaluating the Company’s
assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors. We read the Company’s analysis of a sample of investments and available
information including financial metrics and cash usage. We evaluated the information available to determine the appropriateness of the
Company’s conclusions of whether the investments are impaired.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Salesforce, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Salesforce, Inc.’s (the Company’s) internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes, and our report dated March 8, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Salesforce, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global leader in customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together. With the
Customer 360 platform, the Company delivers a single source of truth, connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service,
market and conduct commerce from anywhere. Since its founding in 1999, Salesforce has pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and artificial
intelligence, enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere era. In March 2022, the Company
changed its corporate name from salesforce.com, inc. to Salesforce, Inc.
Fiscal Year
The Company’s fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2023, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:
•the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;
•the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;
•the valuation of privately-held strategic investments, including impairments;
•the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;
•the average period of benefit associated with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts;
•the useful lives of intangible assets; and
•the fair value of certain stock awards issued.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable, which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segments
The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, the
Company has completed a number of acquisitions which have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the
enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the
Company's acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company’s business operates in one operating segment because most of the Company's service
offerings operate on the Customer 360 Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner, and the Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial
information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated basis.
In January 2023, former co-CEO and Vice Chair of the Company’s Board of Directors, Bret Taylor, resigned his positions from the Company. Prior to his
resignation, Mr. Taylor was identified as a co-CODM along with Marc Benioff, CEO and Chair of the Board. Upon Mr. Taylor’s resignation, Mr. Benioff assumed all
Mr. Taylor’s responsibilities and, as of January, 31 2023, is the primary executive that evaluates the operating results of the Company to assess performance and
allocate resources. Accordingly, the Company determined that the chief executive officer also serves as the CODM for the purposes of segment reporting. Despite the
change in the chief operating decision maker, the Company determined no change to
65
Table of Contents
segment reporting was necessary as there was no change in the components of the Company for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated.
Concentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and
accounts receivable. The Company’s investment portfolio consists primarily of investment-grade securities, and per the Company’s policy, limits the amount of credit
exposure to any one issuer. The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis.
The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable due to estimated credit
losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with
delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss
patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative
expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance
sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.
No single customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022. No single customer accounted for
five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, assets located outside the Americas were 15
percent and 13 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, assets located in the United States were 83 percent and 86 percent
of total assets, respectively.
The Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily
invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2023, the Company held two investments, both privately held,
with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented 16 percent of the portfolio in
aggregate. As of January 31, 2022, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its
strategic investment portfolio and represented 21 percent of the portfolio in aggregate.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support
revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company’s enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software license
revenues from the sales of term and perpetual licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the
sales of software licenses. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and
implementation services and training services.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company
expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees,
contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a
significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.
The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•determination of the transaction price;
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.
Subscription and Support Revenues
Subscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and
updates during the term of the arrangement.
Cloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized
ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company’s subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term and perpetual software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the
software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term and perpetual
66
Table of Contents
software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from software support and updates is
recognized as the support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term.
The Company typically invoices its customers annually and its payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been
invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.
Professional Services and Other Revenues
The Company’s professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed price or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the
services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription
professional services contracts. Other revenues consist primarily of training revenues recognized as such services are performed.
Significant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
The Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple performance obligations such as Cloud Services, software
licenses, support and updates and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are
concluded to be distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one
unit of accounting may require significant judgment.
Cloud Services, software licenses and support and updates services are generally concluded to be distinct because such offerings are often sold separately. In
determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the
services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the
subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has
concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a
promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.
The Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration
include the Company’s discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company’s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are
sold, price lists, the Company's go-to-market strategy, historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where the Company does not sell or price a
product or service separately, the Company determines SSP using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. As the Company’s go-
to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.
In certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances
to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when indicated by the distribution of its observable prices.
Alternatively, the Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when the pricing practices or distribution of the observable prices is highly variable. The
Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and
geography.
Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts
The Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts related to non-cancelable Cloud Services subscription, ongoing Cloud Services
support and license support and updates. For contracts with on-premises software licenses where revenue is recognized upfront when the software is made available
to the customer, costs allocable to those licenses are expensed as they are incurred. Capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the
Company’s direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under
annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts,
(3) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Company’s employees and (4) to a lesser extent, success fees paid to
partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence.
Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which is longer than the typical initial contract period,
but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluated both
qualitative and quantitative factors which
67
Table of Contents
included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid
to partners over two years.
The capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates
whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period
should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment.
Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2023 and 2022.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash
equivalents are stated at fair value.
Marketable Securities
The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and
therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value,
with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized.
Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield
curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected
credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations, and any remaining unrealized
losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and
losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of
investment income within other expense on the consolidated statements of operations.
Strategic Investments
The Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a
controlling interest.
Privately held equity securities where the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in but does exercise significant influence over the investee are
accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable
transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately
held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through gains (losses) on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.
Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated
balance sheet.
Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. The carrying value is not
adjusted for the Company's privately held equity securities if there are no observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are
no identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic
investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held debt and
equity securities in its strategic investment portfolio at least quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both
qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the
investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company recognizes an impairment through the consolidated statements of operations and
establishes a new carrying value for the investment.
Publicly held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes recorded through gains on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of
operations.
The Company may enter into strategic investments or other investments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”). If the Company is a primary
beneficiary of a VIE, it is required to consolidate the entity. To determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company evaluates whether it has
(1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The assessment of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of its VIE investments
requires significant assumptions and judgments. VIEs that are not consolidated are
68
Table of Contents
accounted for under the measurement alternative, equity method, amortized cost, or other appropriate methodology based on the nature of the interest held.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, publicly held equity securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair
value. In addition, the Company measures certain of its strategic investments, including its privately held debt securities and privately held equity securities, at fair
value on a nonrecurring basis when there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security. The additional disclosures regarding the Company’s fair
value measurements are included in Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement.”
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk associated with intercompany
transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. The Company uses forward
currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to minimize the Company’s exposure to balances primarily denominated in the Euro,
British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen. The Company’s derivative financial instruments program is not
designated for trading or speculative purposes. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the financial institutions with which it contracts
for such derivatives, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty, thereby reducing risk of credit-related losses from a financial
institutions' nonperformance. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts
potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of
the Company to the counterparties. The notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 was $6.0 billion and
$6.1 billion, respectively.
Outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses due to
changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts, as well as realized gains or losses from their net settlement, are recognized as other expense consistent with the
offsetting gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement or settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
those assets as follows:
Buildings and building improvements 10 to 40 years
Computers, equipment and software 3 to 5 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 years
Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated lease term or 10 years
The Company estimates the useful lives of property and equipment upon initial recognition and periodically evaluates the useful lives and whether events or
changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the useful lives.
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any
loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and classifies its leases at commencement. Operating leases are included in operating lease
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Assets recognized from finance
leases (also referred to as ROU assets) are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, on
the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The corresponding lease
liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with a
term of 12 months or less for any asset classes.
Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement, net of any future
tenant incentives. The Company has lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to combine for all asset classes. As
such, minimum lease payments include fixed payments for non-lease components within a lease agreement, but exclude variable lease payments not dependent on an
index or rate, such as common area maintenance, operating expenses, utilities, or other costs that are subject to fluctuation from period to period. The Company’s
lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease
liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the
69
Table of Contents
associated extension option or waive the termination option. The Company reassesses the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances
occurs within the control of the Company. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments
is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is an estimate of the interest rate the Company would
have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in the economic environment where the leased asset is located.
The lease ROU asset is recognized based on the lease liability, adjusted for any rent payments or initial direct costs incurred or tenant incentives received prior
to commencement.
Lease expenses for minimum lease payments for operating leases, which includes amortization expense of ROU assets, are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. Amortization expense of finance lease ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and interest expense for finance
lease liabilities is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate. Expense for variable lease payments are recognized as incurred.
On the lease commencement date, the Company also establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at
the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are included in property and equipment, net and are amortized over the lease term to operating expense.
The Company has entered into subleases or has made decisions and taken actions to exit and sublease certain unoccupied leased office space. Similar to other
long-lived assets discussed below, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a leased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease
term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease.
Intangible Assets Acquired through Business Combinations
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets
and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Management tests for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
Impairment Assessment
The Company evaluates intangible assets and other long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions or other
events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to
the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying
amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if
and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.
Business Combinations
The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the
acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the
corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in
connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions
quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the
conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent
adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
In the event the Company acquires an entity with which the Company has a preexisting relationship, the Company will generally recognize a gain or loss to
settle that relationship as of the acquisition date within operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. In the event that the Company acquires an
entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the
carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and recorded within net gains (losses) on strategic investments in the consolidated statements
of operations.

Restructuring
The Company generally recognizes employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable or when notification occurs, depending
on the region an employee works. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or
the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense is measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the grant
date closing stock price for restricted stock awards. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards
on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years. The estimated
forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates.
Stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP” or “2004 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan”) is measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation
expense related to shares issued pursuant to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months. The ESPP
allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a 15 percent discount from the lower of the Company’s stock price on (i) the first day of the
offering period or on (ii) the last day of the purchase period and also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a six-month purchase period
(December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not increase that election until the next one-year offering period. The ESPP also includes a reset provision for the
purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date.
Stock-based compensation expense related to performance share grants, which are awarded to executive officers and other members of senior management and
vest, if at all, based on the Company’s performance over a three-year period relative to the Nasdaq 100. Performance share grants are measured based on grant date at
fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and expensed on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the service period of the awards, which is
generally the vesting term of three years.
The Company, at times, grants unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards
are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment. Therefore, the Company accounts for them as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards, based on the closing stock price on
grant date, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years. 
Advertising Expenses
Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.8 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date.
The Company’s tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits.
The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing
authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on
the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the
appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The
Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the
reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors,
including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the
tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.

Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company’s major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the
period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into
U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations for the period.
Warranties and Indemnification
The Company’s enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are
reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Company’s online help documentation under normal use and circumstances.
The Company’s arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third
party’s intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material
liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement
amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s
service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person’s services as the Company’s director or officer or that person’s
services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company’s request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally
enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the
actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.
New Accounting Pronouncement Adopted in Fiscal 2023
In October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and
Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2021-08”), which requires contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., unearned revenue) acquired in a
business combination to be recognized and measured in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Previously, the Company recognized
contract assets and contract liabilities at the acquisition date based on fair value estimates, which had resulted in a reduction to unearned revenue on the balance
sheet, and therefore, a reduction to revenues that would have otherwise been recorded as an independent entity. ASU 2021-08 is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2022 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 in the first quarter of fiscal
2023 and the impact of the adoption was not material.
Reclassifications
A reclassification to the fiscal 2022 consolidated balance sheet was made to conform to the current period presentation of current debt. This reclassification did
not impact the Company's key metrics including Total Assets, Total Revenues, Income From Operations, Net Income or Operating Cash Flows.

Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 93 percent, 94 percent and 95 percent during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No other
country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.
Contract Balances
Contract Assets
The Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. Contract assets were $648 million as of January 31, 2023 as
compared to $587 million as of January 31, 2022, and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets and other assets, net on the
consolidated balance sheets.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to
customers has occurred or services have been provided. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-
cancelable subscription agreements. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals,
invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.

professional services and other revenue, which is generally recognized ratably or as delivered.
Revenue recognized at a point in time substantially consists of on-premises software licenses.
Approximately 49 percent of total revenue recognized in fiscal 2023 is from the unearned revenue balance as of January, 31, 2022.
Remaining Performance Obligation
Remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that
will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is based on SSP. Remaining performance
obligation is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of software license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign
currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation
denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is subject to future economic
risks, including bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors.
The Company excludes amounts related to performance obligations from professional services contracts that are billed and recognized on a time and materials
basis.
The majority of the Company's noncurrent remaining performance obligation is expected to be recognized in the next 13 to 36 months.

Realized gains on sales of securities, net reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the security at the beginning of the period or
the purchase date, if later.
The Company calculates cumulative realized gains on sales of securities, net, as the difference between the sale proceeds and the initial purchase price for
securities sold during the period. Cumulative realized gains on the sales of securities for fiscal 2023 and 2022 were $87 million and $1.6 billion, net.
4. Fair Value Measurement
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1.    Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2.    Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3.    Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
All of the Company’s cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the
Company’s cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and
models utilizing observable market inputs.

Strategic Investments Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Substantially all of the Company's privately held debt and equity securities and other investments are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The
estimation of fair value for these investments requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, and as a result, the Company deems these assets as Level 3 within
the fair value measurement framework. For investments without a readily determinable fair value, the Company applies valuation methods based on information
available, including the market approach and option pricing models (“OPM”). Observable transactions, such as the issuance of new equity by an investee, are
indicators of investee enterprise value and are used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s investments. An OPM may be utilized to allocate value to the various
classes of securities of the investee, including classes owned by the Company. Such information, available to the Company from investee companies, is
supplemented with estimates such as volatility, expected time to liquidity and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds. When indicators of
impairment are observed, the Company generally uses the market approach to estimate the fair value of its investment, giving consideration to the latest observable
transactions, as well as the investee's current and projected financial performance and other significant inputs and assumptions, including estimated time to exit,
selection and analysis of guideline public companies and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds. The Company's privately held debt and
equity securities and other investments amounted to $4.6 billion and $4.4 billion as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively.

to change as additional information is received and certain tax returns are finalized. The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of intangible
assets acquired, certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, legal and other contingencies as of the acquisition date, income and non-income-based taxes and
residual goodwill. The Company expects to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. The Company has
included the financial results of Traction on Demand in its condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which were not material. The

11. Stockholders’ Equity
The Company maintains the following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (“2014
Inducement Plan”). Options issued have terms of seven years.
The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and
fair value per share:
 Fiscal Year Ended January 31,
2023 2022 2021
Volatility 34 - 40% 34 - 37% 28 - 37%
Estimated life 3.5 years 3.5 years 3.5 years
Risk-free interest rate 1.7 - 4.4% 0.4 - 1.7% 0.2 - 1.4%
Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 62.10 $ 59.34 $ 41.24 
The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations.
Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.
The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S.
government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.
The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.
The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.
In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chair of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a market-based
condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based
restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200 percent, depending on the extent the performance condition is
achieved.

Preferred Stock
The Company’s board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more
series. The Company’s board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights,
conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of
any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Company’s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common
stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, no shares of preferred
stock were outstanding.
Share Repurchase Program
In August 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase
Program”). In February 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program for an aggregate total
authorized of $20.0 billion. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number
of shares. Under the Share Repurchase Program, shares of common stock may be repurchased using a variety of methods, including privately negotiated and/or open
market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as part of
accelerated share repurchases and other methods. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the Company in its discretion and
depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions.
The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method.
During fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 28 million shares of its common stock for approximately $4.0 billion at
an average price per share of $144.94. All repurchases were made in open market transactions. As of January 31, 2023, the Company was authorized to purchase a
remaining $6.0 billion of its common stock under the Share Repurchase Program, which was subsequently increased by an additional $10.0 billion in February 2023.

Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 452 $ 88 $ (1,511)
In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a tax provision of $452 million primarily due to taxes from profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States which
includes withholding taxes. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a tax provision of $88 million primarily due to taxes from profitable jurisdictions outside of the
United states, which was offset by a net U.S. tax benefit primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. In fiscal 2021, the Company changed
its international corporate structure, which included the transfer of certain intangible property to Ireland resulting in a net tax benefit of $2.0 billion related to foreign
deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property transferred to an Irish
subsidiary and were based on the intangible property’s current fair value. The determination of the estimated fair value of the intangible property is complex and
subject to judgement due to the use of subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management. The tax amortization related to the intellectual property
transferred will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely under Irish tax laws. The
deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the currently enacted Irish tax rate. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets will be realized in Ireland.

Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 1,704 $ 1,282 
At January 31, 2023, for federal income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $0.2 billion, which expire in fiscal
2024 through 2038 with the exception of post-2017 losses that do not expire, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $1.1 billion, which
expire in fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2043, foreign tax credits of approximately $79 million, which expire in fiscal 2029 through fiscal 2033. For California income tax
purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion which expire beginning in fiscal 2029 through fiscal 2043, California
research and development tax credits of approximately $730 million, which do not expire.

For other states' income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion, which expire beginning in fiscal 2024
through fiscal 2043 and tax credits of approximately $79 million, which expire beginning in fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2033. Utilization of the Company’s net
operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and
similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.
The Company had a valuation allowance of $633 million and $463 million as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 respectively. The Company regularly
assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not
be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in
each of the applicable jurisdictions. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2023 was primarily due to state tax credits and certain U.S foreign tax
credits that are not expected to be realized. At the end of January 31, 2023, the valuation allowance was primarily related to U.S. states’ net operating loss and tax
credits, and certain U.S foreign tax credits. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations
The Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by
multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position
is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which
is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions):
 Fiscal Year Ended January 31,
 2023 2022 2021
Beginning of period $ 1,822 $ 1,479 $ 1,433 
Tax positions taken in prior period:
Gross increases 53 25 77 
Gross decreases (45) (27) (40)
Tax positions taken in current period:
Gross increases 227 358 107 
Settlements (40) 0 (87)
Lapse of statute of limitations (12) (7) (19)
Currency translation effect (30) (6) 8 
End of period $ 1,975 $ 1,822 $ 1,479 
In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company reported a net increase of approximately $153 million, $343 million, and $46 million, respectively in its
unrecognized tax benefits. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal 2022 was primarily for acquisition related liabilities. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and
2021, total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, if recognized, would have reduced income tax expense
and the Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company has recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of $49 million, $21 million and
$25 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $107 million, $58 million and
$37 million, respectively.
Certain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in countries including the United States, France, Germany and Israel.
The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. As the outcome of the tax audits cannot be
predicted with certainty, if any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company
could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future.
The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its
subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal, Japan, Australia,
Germany, France, United Kingdom, Ireland and Israel to be major tax jurisdictions. The Company’s U.S. federal tax returns since fiscal 2008 remain open to
examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2017 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed.

Table of Contents
The Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that an inconsequential decrease of its unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the next 12 months, as the
applicable statutes of limitations lapse, ongoing examinations are completed, or tax positions meet the conditions of being effectively settled.
13. Net Income Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options and restricted stock units. The dilutive
effect of outstanding awards is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method.
A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions):
4 Fiscal Year Ended January 31,
 2023 2022 2021
Numerator:
Net income $ 208 $ 1,444 $ 4,072 
Denominator:
Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share 992 955 908 
Effect of dilutive securities:
Employee stock awards 5 19 22 
Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings per
share 997 974 930 
The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share does not include the effect of the following
potentially outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because
the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in millions):
 Fiscal Year Ended January 31,
 2023 2022 2021
Employee stock awards 39 4 6 
14. Legal Proceedings and Claims
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to
alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour and
other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including
patent infringement.
In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company’s financial
condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company’s reputation and future operating results.
The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings,
advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however,
inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses
in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and
the Company’s estimates may not prove to be accurate.
In management’s opinion, resolution of all current matters, including all those described below, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s financial statements. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, payment or other contingency, the resolution of a matter could
materially affect the Company’s current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.
Slack Litigation
Beginning in September 2019, seven purported class action lawsuits were filed against Slack, its directors, certain of its officers and certain investment funds
associated with certain of its directors, each alleging violations of securities laws in connection with Slack’s registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration
Statement”) filed with the SEC. All but one of
91
Table of Contents
these actions were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, though one plaintiff originally filed in the County of San Francisco before
refiling in the County of San Mateo (and the original San Francisco action was dismissed). The remaining action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California (the “Federal Action”). In the Federal Action, captioned Dennee v. Slack Technologies, Inc., Case No. 3:19-CV-05857-SI, Slack and the other
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2020. In April 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In May 2020,
Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to certify the court’s order for interlocutory appeal, which the court granted. Slack and the other defendants filed a
petition for permission to appeal the district court’s order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. Oral argument was heard in May
2021. On September 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling. Slack filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on November 3, 2021,
which was denied on May 2, 2022. Slack filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 31, 2022, which was granted on December
13, 2022. Oral argument is scheduled for April 17, 2023. The state court actions were consolidated in November 2019, and the consolidated action is captioned In re
Slack Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CIV05370 (the “State Court Action”). An additional state court action was filed in San Mateo
County in June 2020 but was consolidated with the State Court Action in July 2020. Slack and the other defendants filed demurrers to the complaint in the State
Court Action in February 2020. In August 2020, the court sustained in part and overruled in part the demurrers, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended
complaint, which they filed in October 2020. Slack and the other defendants answered the complaint in November 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class
certification on October 21, 2021, which remains pending. On October 26, 2022, the court stayed the State Court Action pending of Slack’s petition for a writ of
certiorari in the Federal Action. The State Court remains stayed pending the Supreme Court’s decision in the Federal Action. The Federal Action and the State Court
Action seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief on behalf of investors who purchased Slack’s Class A common stock issued pursuant and/or traceable to
the Registration Statement.

ITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and
procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible
controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this
report, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level, that the information we are required to
disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-chief executive officers
and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our co-chief executive officers and chief financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023 based on the guidelines established
in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As a result of COVID-19, and as described above, we took precautionary actions to re-evaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable
assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.
Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2023. We
reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Audit Committee.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
(d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our co-chief executive officers and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based
93
Table of Contents
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures
may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

EXHIBIT 4.8
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934
Salesforce, Inc. (“Salesforce”) has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our
common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CRM.”
The following description of Salesforce capital stock does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the Salesforce amended and
restated certificate of incorporation (“charter”) and the Salesforce amended and restated bylaws (“bylaws”), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit
to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is a part.
DESCRIPTION OF SALESFORCE CAPITAL STOCK
Common Stock
Each share of our common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by our stockholders. A majority of the votes cast is required for
stockholders to elect directors (except that directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast in a contested director election) and to take action on all other matters,
except as otherwise required by law. Subject to any preferences that may apply to any preferred stock that may at the time be outstanding, holders of our common
stock will receive ratably any dividends our board of directors declares out of funds legally available for that purpose. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up, the
holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and any liquidation preference of any preferred stock that
may at the time be outstanding. Our common stock has no preemptive rights, conversion rights, or other subscription rights or redemption or sinking fund provisions.
Preferred Stock
Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series.
Our board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting
rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of
preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on our common stock, diluting the voting power of our common stock, impairing the liquidation rights
of our common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control.
Anti-Takeover Provisions
Some provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
discouraging another party from acquiring control of us.
Delaware Law
We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates, subject to some exceptions, acquisitions of publicly-held Delaware
corporations. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years
following the date the person becomes an interested stockholder, unless:
•our board of directors approved the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder prior to the date the
person attained this status;
•upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, the person owned at least 85 percent of our
voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and issued
under employee stock plans under which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the
plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or
•on or subsequent to the date the person became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved the business combination and the
stockholders other than the interested stockholder authorized the transaction at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of
at least 66 2/3 percent of the outstanding stock not owned by the interested stockholder.
Section 203 defines a “business combination” to include:
•any merger or consolidation involving us and the interested stockholder;
•any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition involving the interested stockholder of 10 percent or more of our assets;
•in general, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by us of any of our stock to the interested stockholder;
•any transaction involving us that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of our stock owned by the interested stockholders; and
•the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other financial benefits provided by or through
us.
In general, Section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as any person who, together with the person’s affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years
prior to the time of determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15 percent or more of a corporation’s voting stock.
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that:
•no action can be taken by stockholders except at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders called in accordance with our bylaws, and stockholders
may not act by written consent;
•the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;
•special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by the stockholders upon the written request of one or more stockholders of record that own, or who
are acting on behalf of persons who own, shares representing 15% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to
vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting, and otherwise in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws;
•stockholders may not fill vacancies on the board of directors;
•our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;
•stockholders must satisfy advance notice procedures to submit proposals or nominate directors for consideration at a stockholders’ meeting;
•stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors;
•we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur as a result of investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to
us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures.
Forum Selection Clause
Under our bylaws, unless Salesforce, in writing, selects or consents to the selection of an alternative forum: (a) the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint
asserting any internal corporate claims (as defined in our bylaws), to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, shall be
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State
of Delaware) and (b) the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, shall be the federal district courts of the United States of America. The forum selection provisions do not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty
or liability created by the Exchange Act.
Exhibit 10.16
Salesforce, Inc.
Fiscal 2024 Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy
(Approved by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2023)
RSU Award. Each non-employee director receives a Restricted Stock Unit award (“RSU Award”), with a grant date fair value of approximately
$360,000 (the “RSU Award Value”).
•Grant Date: The fiscal 2024 RSU Award will be granted on February 16, 2023 for non-employee directors in service as of that date.
•Number of RSUs: The number of shares of Salesforce common stock (“Common Stock”) subject to the RSU Award will be equal to the RSU
Award Value divided by the closing sales price of Common Stock on the grant date (or if not a trading day, the preceding trading day),
rounded down to the nearest whole share.
•Vesting: The RSU Award will vest in four equal installments on February 22, May 22, August 22, and November 22, 2023 (each, a “Quarterly
Vest Date”), subject to each non-employee director’s continued service as a non-employee director through each applicable vesting date.
New Directors – Grant Date. For non-employee directors who join the Board after the beginning of fiscal 2024, the fiscal 2024 RSU Award will be
granted on the first day of the month following effectiveness of that director’s appointment or election to the Board.
New Directors – Grant Amount. Non-employee directors who join the Board after the first day of fiscal 2024 will receive a pro-rated RSU Award
(the “Pro-Rated RSU Award”). The value of the Pro-Rated RSU Award will be equal to the RSU Award Value multiplied by a fraction, with the
numerator equal to the number of days remaining in the fiscal year including and following the effective date of appointment or election, and the
denominator equal to 365 (the “Pro-Rated RSU Award Value”).
The number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Pro-Rated RSU Award will be equal to the applicable Pro-Rated RSU Award Value divided by
the closing sales price of Common Stock on the grant date (or if not a trading day, the preceding trading day), rounded down to the nearest whole
share.
New Directors – Vesting. For non-employee directors who join the Board after the first day of fiscal 2024, the Pro-Rated RSU Award will vest in
equal installments on each of the remaining Quarterly Vest Dates following the grant date of the Pro-Rated RSU Award as follows, in each case
subject to the non-employee director’s continued service as a non-employee director through each applicable vesting date. If all fiscal 2024 Quarterly
Vest Dates have occurred as of the grant date, then the Pro-Rated RSU Award will vest entirely on the first Quarterly Vest Date of the next fiscal year.
For example:
oIf a non-employee director joins the Board effective March 1, the Pro-Rated RSU Award would be granted on April 1 and would vest in equal
installments on May 22, August 22, and November 22.
oIf a non-employee director joins the Board effective June 15, the Pro-Rated RSU Award would be granted on July 1 and would vest in equal
installments on August 22 and November 22.
oIf a non-employee director joins the Board effective December 1, the Pro-Rated RSU Award would be granted on January 1 and would vest
entirely on February 22 of the next fiscal year.
Departing Directors – RSU Value and Vesting. For non-employee directors who, at the time of grant, have notified the Company that they do not
intend to stand for re-election at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the RSU Award Value will be pro-rated to be 50% of the RSU Award Value
that would otherwise apply. The RSU Award for such directors will vest in two equal installments, on February 22 and May 22, subject to the non-
employee director’s continued service as a non-employee director through each applicable vesting date.
Cash Fees. Each non-employee director serving in any of the roles listed below will also receive annual cash fees in the amounts set forth below.
Annual cash fees will be paid in quarterly installments that generally will be paid on or about the first business day of each fiscal quarter, except that
the quarterly cash fees for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 will be paid on or about March 1, 2023.

acceleration of vesting of any of the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award, if Participant is a U.S. taxpayer , the payment of such
accelerated Restricted Stock Units may only be made at a time or times that would result in such Restricted Stock Units to be exempt

Restricted Stock Units that vest in accor dance with paragraph 3 will be paid to Participant (or in the event of Participant’ s death, to his or
her estate) as soon as practicable following the date of vesting, subject to paragraph 8. Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance
